The images in this feature were taken during his recent trip to document the lives of Pashmina goat herders.\n\nAt an altitude of more than 14,000 feet, where winter temperatures can fall to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, it is hard to believe anyone, or anything, can survive in the vast ice desert that is Changthang, on the Tibetan Plateau between India and China. Situated between the Himalayan and Karakorum mountain ranges, it is the highest permanently inhabited plateau in the world, and home to an extremely hardy and rare breed of goat -- the Changra, or Pashmina goat.\n\nThe region's high altitudes, freezing temperatures and harsh winds are essential in stimulating the growth of the goats' super-soft undercoat. The fibers can measure a mere 12 microns in width, making them around eight times finer than human hair and up to eight times warmer than sheep wool. This luxurious fiber is known as Pashmina, the softest and most expensive type of cashmere wool in the world.\n\nRearing these valuable animals in such inhospitable conditions are the Changpa people. For centuries these nomadic shepherds, who are as hardy as their animals, have roamed \"the roof of the world,\" moving their herds of yak, sheep and goats along traditional migratory routes every few months in search of fresh grazing pastures.\n\nMoving thousands of goats over vast distances requires skill and experience if herders are to prevent injury to -- or loss of -- their animals. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nBut their ancient way of life is now under threat from climate change, fake Pashmina imports from China and the lure of an easier and more comfortable life.\n\nI have known of the Changpa people for some time, but it was only recently that I learned of their struggles. I visited them in the Ladakh region, on the Indian side of the plateau, to photograph their winter migration in early December.\n\nChangthang rarely gets much snowfall, and when it does, it usually begins in January or February. For the last few years, however, it has been increasingly heavy, starting as early as December, even November.\n\nThe goats naturally begin shedding their fur in the spring, and herders harvest it using a special comb. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nThe unexpected snowfall was great for my pictures, but it was a major inconvenience for the herders. The high pass they travel through is untraversable once covered in snow, and food supplements have to be brought in to prevent the animals dying from starvation.\n\nThe nomads and scientists alike are adamant that climate change is the biggest threat to Pashmina production in the region. And despite the snowfall, the winters are in fact getting warmer, which reduces the quality and quantity of the valuable Pashmina wool. Warmer temperatures mean that the goats don't grow such thick undercoats, reducing the yield of this soft fur and making it harder to separate from the coarse outer fur.\n\nOver a relatively short period of time, dozens of nomad families from the Changthang plateau have migrated away from their village, Kharnak, to the outskirts of Leh, a city 180 kilometers away. There, the herders who have given up their nomadic lives have set up their own neighborhood, called Kharnak Ling.\n\nA yak caravan winds its way across steep valleys. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nOn my recent visit to the region, the chief of Kharnak village, Targais Tashi, expressed his concerns. \"These are worrying times we are experiencing,\" he said. \"If weather patterns continue (changing) like they are, then it could have an irreversible impact on Pashmina goat-rearing on the Changthang. There were once more than 90 families in Kharnak and now there are only 16. If the number Changpa families in Kharnak fall below 10 then it will become too tough for us to continue this life.\n\n\"The younger generation would rather work in the city and cannot be persuaded to continue this physically, mentally and emotionally demanding existence.\"\n\nDespite the herders' brutal living conditions, they are some of the friendliest and most generous people one could ever wish to meet. They let me live with them and capture moments of their life on the understanding that I would spread awareness of their struggles. The region is desperately hoping that revenue from international tourism can help fill the economic hole left by the struggling Pashmina industry.\n\nMany Changpa women have abandoned their nomadic lives, and now weave the wool outside the city of Leh. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nThe Indian government's Ministry of Textiles has attempted to reverse the trend by providing funding and supplies to encourage the Changpas to return to rearing goats on the plateau.\n\nIn recent years however, due to a lack of Pashmina wool from Ladakh's herders, weavers in the wider Kashmir region have begun importing raw Pashmina from China and Mongolia to meet ever-increasing demand for their products. Much of this Pashmina is not what it is claimed to be. Although the goats are the same breed, they are not reared in the extreme conditions required to stimulate the growth of the super-soft undercoat required to be considered 100% pure Pashmina.\n\nPashmina is expensive -- and rightly so. The Changpa carefully comb the goats' hair during the spring molting season to harvest the downy undercoat, and then the good fiber is laboriously separated from the bad by hand. Once cleaned and processed, the usable wool from a cashmere goat amounts to just four ounces.\n\nEvery few months, the herders migrate with their yak, sheep and goats in search of fresh grazing pastures. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nThe fibers are then hand spun, after which the equally painstaking weaving process can begin. A Pashmina shawl can take around 180 hours to produce, and larger items can take several months or even a year for highly skilled artisans to weave on wooden looms. They are then exported around the world, where luxury retailers sell them for hundred or thousands or dollars.\n\nAmid decreasing herd populations and increasing demand for cashmere from the Ladakh region, scientists at the University of Kashmir set out to produce the world's first Pashmina goat clone. In 2012, the female kid Noori was born. But the idea of using clones more widely has proven controversial among the Changpa herders, who see it as incompatible with their Buddhist beliefs.\n\nThe perils to goat rearing in turn threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the region who, directly or indirectly depend on Pashmina. The trade's decline could also spell the end of the unique culture of the Changpas, for whom livestock are more than a source of income, but a way of life.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pashmina-goat-herders-struggle-against-climate-change/index.html", "published": "2020-01-02T08:51:29+00:00"}, {"title": "The most anticipated buildings set to shape the world in 2020", "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nBut at the dawn of a new decade, it seems fitting to look ahead at the structures set to shape our cities -- and architecture itself -- in the coming year.\n\nFrom museums and skyscrapers, to a hotel with a hole in it, these are CNN Style's most anticipated buildings opening or completing in 2020.\n\nVancouver House, Vancouver, Canada\n\nBIG / Luxigon\n\nTwisting from a triangular base to a rectangular top, Vancouver House appears to defy the laws of engineering when viewed from afar.\n\nIt's precisely the sort of eccentricity we've come to expect from Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect who recently built a ski slope on top of a power plant in Copenhagen. But it's also a smart response to various restrictions and regulations that limited the size of the tower's footprint in downtown Vancouver.\n\nThe pixelated facade, also characteristic of Ingels' work, helps to create deep-set balconies for residents in the 493-foot-tall tower.\n\nNanjing Zendai Himalayas Center, Nanjing, China\n\nMAD Architects\n\nTaking inspiration from traditional Chinese \"shanshui\" paintings (literally \"mountain and water\"), Ma Yansong's curved creations merge nature with the built environment. This new 23-acre development in the historic city of Nanjing is surely the most ambitious realization of the architect's \"shanshui city\" concept to date.\n\nIrregular white fins give the complex's towers the appearance of icy mountains, their flowing lines contributing to what Beijing-born Ma's firm, MAD, describes as a \"philosophy of cooperation between humanity and nature.\" At ground level, six separate plots are connected via man-made streams and footbridges.\n\nWith the country's authorities pushing for increasingly conservative architecture , the complex is a refreshing reminder of what bold Chinese architecture can look like.\n\nPowerhouse Telemark, Porsgrunn, Norway\n\nBloomimages / Sn\u00f8hetta\n\nSn\u00f8hetta made international headlines last year when its underwater restaurant -- Europe's first -- opened near the southernmost tip of Norway. But the design firm has also gained a reputation for innovative carbon-negative buildings that, over their lifetimes, produce more energy than they consume.\n\nLocated on the banks of the Porsgrunn River, the practice's latest \"energy-positive\" project, Powerhouse Telemark, has been designed to \"set a new standard for the construction of the buildings of tomorrow.\"\n\nEverything about the sleek structure, which is almost entirely coated in photovoltaic cells, has its carbon footprint in mind, from a diamond shape that maximizes the solar energy it captures, to the use of recycled materials from local demolition projects.\n\nNew Museum of Western Australia, Perth, Australia\n\nPeter Bennetts / Hassell / OMA\n\nIn designing a museum on a site littered with historic buildings, architecture firms Hassell and OMA faced a delicate task: building a 21st-century museum while preserving the surrounding heritage.\n\nThe result is a striking contemporary creation that complements, interacts with and wraps around existing structures -- some of which date back to the mid-19th century -- producing an unlikely synergy of brick, glass and steel.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature is how the museum's huge upper volume hangs dramatically over Hackett Hall, the State Library's old reading room.\n\nGrand Egyptian Museum, Cairo, Egypt\n\nMohamed-El-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSuch have been the delays facing the Grand Egyptian Museum that it featured on this very list two years ago -- and the $1-billion project is still yet to open.\n\nHaving said that, 2020 looks sure to be the year it finally does. As well as offering a permanent home to tens of thousands of archeological treasures, including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb, the 5.2-million-square-foot museum symbolizes efforts to repair the country's tourism industry in the wake of the 2011 revolution.\n\nThe building's glass-fronted design, first unveiled over 15 years ago, will offer sweeping panoramas of the Great Pyramids and Giza plateau.\n\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport, Berlin, Germany\n\nG\u00fcnter Wicker / Flughafen Berlin\n\nBerlin's new Brandenburg airport is, perhaps, less anticipated for its design than for the fact it's almost a decade late.\n\nFollowing years of setbacks, the German capital's new transport hub is finally due to open its doors in 2020. And while it wouldn't be the project's first missed deadline (officials initially expected it to open in October 2011), there seems to be an air of certainty about the recent announcement that the airport would enter operation in October.\n\nThe terminal building, which sits between two parallel runways, was designed to represent the region's architectural heritage. Official press materials cite the influence of 19th-century Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the celebrated Bauhaus art school.\n\nOpus, Dubai, UAE\n\nLaurian Ghinitoiu / Zaha Hadid Architects\n\nMore than three years after her death, Zaha Hadid continues to shape the world's cities with her bold, curvilinear creations.\n\nOpus, which was first proposed by the British-Iraqi architect in 2007, takes the form of a glass-fronted cube punctured with an asymmetric hole that appears to bulge at the seams. Yet, closer inspection reveals that the building is formed from two separate towers joined by a four-story atrium at its base and a footbridge connecting the upper floors.\n\nThe structure will house a boutique hotel -- with interiors also designed by Hadid -- as well as office space and restaurants. Despite being located just a kilometer from the 2,717-feet-tall Burj Khalifa, it might yet be the neighborhood's most eye-catching piece of architecture.\n\n1000 Trees, Shanghai, China\n\nQingyan Zhu / Heatherwick Studio\n\nBritish designer Thomas Heatherwick has never been short of ambition. And now his seemingly farfetched vision of a tree-covered urban mountain has become a reality.\n\nThe 3.2-million-square foot development now occupies a huge stretch of riverside in Shanghai. Structural columns emerge from the structure's mass to hold some of the plants and greenery alluded to in the project's name, 1000 Trees.\n\nMore than a piece of architecture, this is, in Heatherwick Studio's own words, \"a piece of topography.\"\n\nM+ Museum, Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nCourtesy of Herzog & de Meuron / West Kowloon Cultural District Authority\n\nSet across a huge swathe of reclaimed land in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, the West Kowloon Cultural District has been more than 20 years in the making. And of the many theaters and cultural institutions set to eventually open in the development, none are more hotly anticipated than M+.\n\nThe museum is expected to have one of the Asian continent's most impressive collections of contemporary visual art. Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron has built a visually arresting design to boot -- a horizontal slab (containing exhibitions spaces) and a vertical one (housing everything else) conjoined into an upside-down \"T.\"\n\nAlthough the building is set to complete within the next few months, it will be another nine to 12 months before it is opened to the public. Nonetheless, the completion of M+ is a major milestone for the long-awaited cultural quarter.\n\nSingapore Pavilion at the Dubai Expo 2020, Dubai, UAE\n\nSingapore Pavilion, Expo 2020 Dubai\n\nFrom October, Expo 2020 will see hundreds of participating countries construct pavilions in and around Dubai.

And the architecture firm behind the project, WOHA, thinks it can make the project energy neutral over the course of the expo.\n\nInnovations to that end include solar-powered desalination systems for irrigation and a cantilevered roof to provide shade.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/anticipated-buildings-2020/index.html", "published": "2020-01-01T00:24:02+00:00"}, {"title": "Why movie villains love modern architecture", "text": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nAs James Bond in the 1974 classic \"The Man with the Golden Gun,\" actor Roger Moore pilots a seaplane above the clear gemstone waters of Thailand's Phang Nga Bay, meant to be somewhere off the coast of China.\n\nBond's antagonist, the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, has fortified his hideout within a towering limestone karst. When 007 enters the secluded home, Scaramanga's henchman, Nick Nack, flips a switch from the home's control station, sending the hero into a dizzying red-lit funhouse of horrors.\n\nScaramanga's hideout in \"The Man with the Golden Gun.\" Credit: Eon Productions\n\nMiami-based architect Chad Oppenheim first saw the film and Scaramanga's hideout when he was seven years old. It was the start of an obsession with the ultimate lair. \"Either I could become a supervillain and build one of these (lairs), or become an architect,\" he said.\n\nOppenheim explores his darker road not traveled in \"Lair,\" a recent book from Tra Publishing, that renders 15 highly secretive dwellings in black-and-white architectural drawings. They include the Nordic alpine hideaway in \"Ex Machina,\" the spidery underwater sea home in \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" the sleek Mount Rushmore abode in \"North By Northwest,\" and the eerie Brutalist Wallace Corporation HQ in \"Blade Runner 2049.\"\n\nA still from \"Blade Runner 2049.\" Credit: Columbia Pictures\n\nThe lairs generally share commonalities: They are pristine, awe-inspiring, high-tech, otherworldly, often impractical, and draw heavily on the tenets of modernism. The book poses the question: Why do bad guys live in good houses?\n\n\"Villain's lairs always have the sexiest architecture, inviting you to be the bad guy,\" said Leah Greenblatt, critic-at-large of Entertainment Weekly, at a panel in New York City for the book. Besides the titular childhood home in \"Skyfall,\" she asked, \"does James Bond even have a home?\" Oppenhenheim toyed with the idea of the hero's hideout too -- the Bat Cave, the Fortress of Solitude -- but generally finds supervillains have \"a little bit more depth to them,\" he said.\n\nOppenheim and his team came up with a rubric for which hideouts made the final cut -- and what counted as true villainry. \"First, primarily, the lairs had to be aspirational. They also had to be incredibly beautiful from an architectural standpoint,\" he explained. They omitted the lavish John Lautner-designed mansion of porn director Jackie Treehorn in \"The Big Lebowski,\" not deeming him a real antagonist. Darth Vader's hellfire stronghold in \"Star Wars\" also lost out in favor of the Death Star because Oppenheim decided nobody would actually want to live on an untenable volcanic planet.\n\nThe Death Star from \"Star Wars.\" Credit: Lucasfilm\n\nThey also opted for bad guys who had grand visions for humanity, not so much the brutal nature of serial killers like Hannibal Lecter. \"They're very utopian, in a way, in that they believe they're actually doing the right things -- like most megalomaniacs,\" Oppenheim said. Their chosen architecture represents their colorful personalities. \"A lot of these villains either want to be old-world gentlemen or they want to be super hyper-modern, and there's not really an in-between,\" Greenblatt noted -- except for the high-tech exterior, \"Downton Abbey\"-like interior of Karl Stromberg's sea arachnid, she conceded.\n\n\"Lair\" examines how modernist, futuristic, and utopian architecture has long been associated with amorality. Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, sleek homes, equally minimal and extravagant, made of glass, steel, and concrete, have become the archetypal home for the idealistic recluse with dastardly ambition.\n\n\"Modern domestic architecture has become identified almost exclusively with characters who are evil, unstable, selfish, obsessive, and driven by pleasure of the flesh,\" Joseph Rosa writes in an essay in the book. \"Were they still alive, this might thoroughly shock the pioneers of modernism, who envisioned their movement facilitating a healthy, honest, and moral way of life.\"\n\nDon Draper's New York pad. Credit: AMC\n\nWhile family life on television has most often been portrayed in cozy, traditional settings, modernist digs have been reserved for wayward bachelors -- like Don Draper of \"Mad Men\" leaving his suburban colonial home with Betty for cleaner lines and a new love interest in Manhattan.\n\nModern architecture has not been as readily embraced by Americans. In addition, Rosa points out, mistrust of technology following World War II deepened the idea that progress and innovation could be dangerous.\n\nProduction designers often reference Brutalism's monumental poured concrete forms or Constructivism's collective social ideas to build out dystopian settings. The Ken Adams-designed bunker in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and the bleak tower blocks in \"A Clockwork Orange\" both follow this lineage. On the panel, film critic Chris Nashawaty commented on Constructivism: \"It's an architecture of propaganda, and like all these villains or dictators or communist rulers ... it's all about convincing people that there's power and thought and might.\"\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nIllustration of The Vandamm House in \"North By Northwest,\" from \"Lair.\" Credit: Courtesy Tra Publishing\n\nBut many supervillains are drawn to the natural world as well. Such inclinations find an unlikely influence in Frank Lloyd Wright, whose organic architecture movement preached a symbiosis with the environment. Hollywood often finds its favorite lairs in the designs of architect and Wright protege John Lautner: the Hollywood Hills lookout homes in \"Body Double\" and \"Lethal Weapon 2,\" and the desert hideout in \"Diamonds Are Forever.\" Wright's presence appears again in \"North By Northwest.\" Hitchcock asked the architect to build the home perched atop Mount Rushmore, but couldn't afford him and built a set inspired by the architect's work instead.\n\nHarnessing the power of nature itself is the ultimate feat of ambition. In \"The Incredibles,\" Buddy Pine's volcanic island home boasts a wall made of lava. \"Star Wars'\" Death Star resembles a moon, but has the power to destroy entire worlds -- an idea that was drawn from history: The US, Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany all considered the potential of a deadly orbiting satellite.\n\nOppenheim sees a link between our own destructive behaviors and the villain's impulse to dominate nature. \"We've really tried to conquer the planet. (Our) civilization has manipulated nature to its advantage, and we're just building more and more,\" he said.\n\nVillains represent our worst inclinations with grandiose, destructive visions. They utilize their hideouts to retreat from humanity, taking refuge in immaculate spaces, their complicated defense systems, and the privacy of secret chambers or a far-flung volcanic crater lake.\n\nBut their desires are ultimately very human. \"These lairs are kind of mocking the whole idea of domesticity, because in a way that's what they want,\" Nashawaty said. \"They want these big houses. They want what everybody wants.\"\n\n\"Lair Radical Homes And Hideouts Of Movie Villains\" is available now from Tra Publishing.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect the film's location of Scaramanga's hideout in the \"The Man with the Golden Gun,\" instead of the novel's location.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/movie-villains-modern-architecture/index.html", "published": "2019-12-24T09:10:14+00:00"}, {"title": "From the 'Iliad' to 'Circe': Culture's enduring fascination with the myths of Troy", "text": "In partnership with Written by Jan Haywood\n\nJan Haywood is a lecturer in classical studies at the UK's Open University. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\nThe story of the epic war fought over a woman has been told many times. It now lies at the heart of an ongoing exhibition at the British Museum.\n\nTroy: Myth and Reality \" introduces audiences to the history of the archaeological site of Troy (modern-day Hisarlik, Turkey), many of the different individuals caught up in the Trojan War and various later responses to this powerful legend in drama and literature.\n\nThat the story of the Trojan War should be the subject of a blockbuster exhibition comes as little surprise. Ever since classical antiquity, audiences have been consistently telling and retelling stories about the site of Troy and the heroic war that was fought there between the Trojans and the Achaeans (later conflated with the Greeks). The most famous telling of all perhaps is \"The Iliad\" from the 8th century B.C., composed by Homer, a figure shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe Homeric poem captures the story of a dreadful, ten-year war fought between two nations. It shows the major influence of powerful men on the battlefield, such as the Trojan prince Hector and the commander of the Myrmidons, Achilles. For these individuals, deeds performed in war will secure them \"everlasting fame.\"\n\nBut the poem also illustrates the horrendous impact of the war far away from the battlefield. In one memorable passage, Briseis, the captive prisoner of Achilles, laments the slaughter of her husband and children. It is a heartbreaking account that shows acutely the universal misery brought on by the bloodshed of war.\n\nPortrait of Homer, copy of an original dating from 200-100 BC. Credit: Courtesy British Museum\n\nTroy after Homer\n\nEver since Homer, people have looked to expand on and retell different aspects of the Trojan War in light of their own circumstances.\n\nThe 5th century B.C. Athenian playwright Euripides produced several plays that depicted the aftermath of the conflict. In his play \"The Trojan Women,\" Euripides centers the widows of Troy and the hardships they endure at the hands of their Greek oppressors, who divide the women like booty between themselves.\n\nIt is an uncompromising account that many have read as a biting commentary on the civil war fought between Athens and Sparta at the end of the 5th century BCE. The play does not glorify war and instead highlights its horrors through Troy's displaced women.\n\nPieces of parchment found in excavations at the site of Troy is displayed at the British Museum. Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOf course, the creation of refugees through warfare and the transportation of human bodies across geographic boundaries is a profound concern for audiences today. The ongoing Syrian civil war has created around 6.7 million refugees , who have been dispersed across the globe. And the recent shocking discovery of 39 Vietnamese nationals' bodies in a lorry in Grays, Essex in October is a ghastly reminder of the terrible conditions that many refugees have faced past and present.\n\nTroy today\n\nIn contemporary culture too, there has been a spate of interest in the stories and myths of Troy.\n\nThe exhibition shows clearly the impact it has had on the visual arts. Highlights include a 1978 collage by the African American artist Romare Bearden, titled \"The Sirens' Song,\" which recasts Odysseus' journey home after the war with African American subjects. Bearden's work employs the familiar story of Troy to give the African American experience a universal and classical representation.\n\n\"Judgement of Paris (after Rubens)\" from \"Helen's Odyssey\" (2007) by Eleanor Antin Credit: \u00a9 Eleanor Antin. Courtesy of the artist and Ronald Feldman Gallery, New York.\n\nAnother notable work is a print called \"Judgement of Paris\" (2007), pictured above, by the conceptual artist Eleanor Antin. The photo, which riffs on Peter Paul Ruben's \" Judgement of Paris \" (1639), highlights the powerlessness of Helen who sits looking outwards, forced to the margins of the image. Antin's work turns this on its head. Featured as part of a series called \"Helen's Odyssey,\" the photo challenges a tradition that has often vilified the Spartan queen Helen for her involvement in the war.\n\nA recent significant development has been the growing number of English-language fictional accounts about Troy written by women. These works retell and expand on various aspects of the Trojan War story from the perspective of the women involved. They range from Pat Barker's \"The Silence of the Girls,\" which retells \"The Iliad\" from the perspective of the story's women, to Madeline Miller's bestseller \"Circe,\" a feminist exploration of certain events from \"The Odyssey.\" Such works offer a potent challenge to a tradition that has been wholly dominated by male authors and male-centered stories.\n\n\"The Wounded Achilles. Marble\" (1825) by Filippo Albacini Credit: \u00a9 The Devonshire Collections, Chatsworth. Reproduced by permission of Chatsworth Settlement Trustees.\n\nAn especially impressive entry in this burgeoning group of women writers' works on Troy is Alice Oswald's 2011 poem \"Memorial,\" an idiosyncratic translation of \"The Iliad.\" The poem evokes various contemporary war memorials, such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, in its opening which lists the names of almost all the men whose deaths are reported in \"The Iliad.\"\n\nWhat's more, the poem records moments in which the soldiers of \"The Iliad\" die on the battlefield. In doing so, as in \"The Iliad,\" Oswald repeatedly draws attention to bereaved parents, widowed partners and fatherless children. In an age where technology has changed the methods and image of warfare, desensitizing us to such violence, works like \"Memorial\" are a timely reminder of the human costs of deadly conflict.\n\nIt is clear, then, that Troy and the stories that surround it continue to shape culture thousands of years after the Trojan War ostensibly occurred. This is what makes the British Museum exhibition so relevant for audiences today. The story of the Trojan War is a story of universal suffering that stretches past the battlefield. It is a story that highlights the absurdity of war, which at its core holds sentiments that ring as true today as they did in antiquity.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/culture-fascination-with-the-myths-of-troy/index.html", "published": "2020-01-03T01:22:20+00:00"}, {"title": "'Little Women': Costumes get a modern spin in Greta Gerwig adaptation", "text": "Written by Ananda Pellerin, CNN\n\nFrom the sinister, suit-clad cast of 2011's Cold War thriller \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,\" to Emma Watson's ballroom-ready Belle in 2017's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" British designer Jacqueline Durran is no stranger to costuming period films.\n\nThe secret to success for the Oscar winner -- she won an Academy Award in Costume Design for \"Anna Karenina\" in 2012 -- is her personal approach, designing as much for actors as she does for their characters.\n\nFor Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women,\" she dressed a star-studded cast including Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen, as the four March sisters.\n\nDurran's modern sensibility is matched only by her carefully researched designs, bringing to life the 2019 adaptation of the 1868 classic novel. CNN spoke with her in a phone interview from London.\n\nCNN: How did you channel the era and characters for \"Little Women\"?\n\nJacqueline Durran: The first thing I do for any project is research the period. For \"Little Women\" I looked at contemporary photographs and paintings, and at fashion magazines from the time, which were really just books on how to make things and small line drawings of what was fashionable.\n\nFlorence Pugh as Amy March (with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). Credit: Wilson Webb/CTMG/Sony Pictures\n\nI also looked at pictures of artists and radical communities, and people who were using photography to represent a different way of seeing things. I felt like that was the spirit of the March sisters.\n\nHow do you balance the fictional character with the actress playing her?\n\nIn the first fitting I'll have the research, and I just sit down and talk through with them what kind of elements I like.\n\nThen they start trying things on. At this stage it's usually just shapes to get a feeling of the silhouette of the character, what the mood is. Then you start thinking about fabrics and the number of costume changes, you sort of pull it all together into a story arc.\n\nWorking with the actress is by far the most rewarding way of doing it. I love actresses who are engaged in what they want to look like.\n\nDid you get that on \"Little Women?\"\n\n100%. Also, I've known Saiorse since she was twelve, when we both worked on \"Atonement.\"\n\nHow did you choose the color palettes for each of the March girls?\n\nThey were taken from the color of the notebooks that Marmee (the girls' mother, played by Laura Dern) gives them on Christmas Day.\n\nActress Saoirse Ronan as Jo March. Credit: Sony Pictures\n\nJo's color is red. I presume it reflects her temper, or her spirit. But I didn't want her to wear red really obviously throughout the whole movie, so I threaded the color in and out of her story. She often has a bit of red on but very rarely all red, though she does for the first party.\n\nIt was the same with Meg. I think her actual color was green, but we didn't want her to be just wearing that, so we balanced it with lavender.\n\nBeth's colors were pink to brown, which we ran with, and Amy's was light blue, which comes in and out of her story.\n\nAre there specific challenges to dressing an ensemble cast instead of a solo lead?\n\nYou have to think about the actress in the context of the other actresses. It also just means a lot of costumes. Instead of one leading lady with twelve changes, you've got five women with twelve changes -- that's already sixty costumes. It's a mountain of clothing to design and make, while keeping things fresh and not repetitive.\n\nBut the ensemble cast was one of the biggest pleasures for me, because the actresses were all amazing.\n\nThe costumes have a contemporary feel to them even though they are clearly period pieces -- how did you strike this balance?\n\nWhen I first met with Amy Pascal, the producer, and Greta, I got the feeling that while they wanted it to be accurate to the period, they didn't want something that felt too strictly Victorian in a way that meant you couldn't identify with the characters.\n\nI tried to make it seem like the actresses really lived in the clothes. They had leeway in how they wore them, and also reused things in different combinations so you got the sense that these were items from their own wardrobes. In the spirit of Greta's film, you don't feel like you're in a very formal world, you feel like you're in something much looser.\n\nThe March girls struggle with work-life balance, finding love, keeping family, creating a home and trying to be independent in the world. \"Little Women\" still feels relevant today.\n\nGreta often uses the example that Louisa May Alcott kept her copyright, but Taylor Swift currently has a problem with her own copyright. We're still fighting the same battles and the same issues around status.\n\nOne of the joys of this film is that you get to see four different women, and each way of being is equally valid. For instance, Jo comes off as smart about how the world works, while Amy is an artist who is going to make her way. But, 150 years on, I fear that economics for women are not as advanced as they should be.\n\nWhat was it like dressing Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays Jo's supportive friend Laurie?\n\nThe challenge of dressing men is finding a way to create character within a limited range of choices -- menswear just doesn't have the variety that womenswear does.\n\nBut with Timoth\u00e9e, I had a broad range of styles to draw from. I wanted to make him look like a privileged, artistic boy. I had some reference pictures of young boys dressed in velvet suits from the mid-nineteenth-century, and I combined that aesthetic with shapes from boyswear of an earlier decade.\n\nWhen it came to his later, grown-up costumes I pushed the reference later, into the 1880s, though one of the key references was a Tissot painting of a group of men in Paris in 1867.\n\nEmma Watson and Greta Gerwig on the set of Little Women Credit: Wilson Webb/CTMG/Sony Pictures\n\nEven ten years ago there would have been a high chance this film would have been directed by a man. Have you seen the industry change over your career?\n\nI have but not as much as you'd think. It's a bit like the world, you feel like things have moved on a lot and then you think, hang on, no actually we're still not there yet.\n\nI have worked with some women directors, but I'm thrilled there are more coming through. It would be great to get to a point where women represented different voices in directing, rather than just being women directors. We need a broad spectrum of people telling a broad spectrum of stories.\n\nGreta is one of those people, she is an inspiration. What she represented as a widely loved actress is what she's brought to the spirit of her directing. It's something that everyone can imagine and be enthusiastic about straight away. For her to take on this film and do such a great job is a big step forward.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/little-women-costumes-jacqueline-durran/index.html", "published": "2019-12-26T00:40:44+00:00"}, {"title": "Photographer Tania Franco Klein asks if we can ever truly disconnect", "text": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nA woman in red stands in a vacant parking lot, fabric billowing in an upward arc to obscure her face.

Unmoored, her anxiety and depression began to grow. It wasn't just her, she realized -- many of her friends, living all over the world, were experiencing the same extreme unease over the future. In a bookstore in Madrid, she found the book \"The Burnout Society,\" by South Korean-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han, and it spoke to her -- the idea that as a society we are obsessed with performing, multi-tasking, optimizing, and self-improvement, fueling a collective and deeply rooted sense of anxiety and isolation.\n\nKlein captures the emotions of modern anxieties.

It will also be used for soccer matches and various track-and-field events during the Games.\n\nThe stadium's roof was constructed using steel and latticed wood.

Celebrated architect Arata Isozaki described Hadid's design as a \"disgrace to future generations.\"\n\nThe reins were then passed to 65-year-old Kuma, and he set about reimagining the project in his characteristically organic style. The architect said that his stadium design was partly inspired by Tokyo's Edo-period temples.\n\n\"All over the world, architecture in the 20th century that uses concrete and steel feels cold and stiff. I want to make it softer, kinder, warmer,\" said Kuma, whose firm designed the venue alongside architecture firm Azusa Sekkei. \"I think that's the kind of architecture that humans need, during this stressful era.\"\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 68,000.

It is located in the Meijijingu Gaien park, which Kuma described as \"the greenest place in Tokyo.\"\n\n\"Of course, we would like both athletes and spectators to enjoy the stadium, but at the same time we thought of something we can contribute to the community,\" Kuma said, highlighting the pedestrianized areas he designed around the structure. \"We've designed a place where everyone in the community can enjoy a walk there,\" he added.\n\nThe late switch of design meant that construction on the stadium did not begin until late 2016.

It's almost uplifting.\"\n\nKodachrome slides are rectangular pieces of color reversal film encased in cardboard that were loaded into slide projectors and beamed onto walls. The film itself was introduced by the Eastman Kodak Company in 1935, and it helped popularize photography among regular people after World War II.\n\nFine-grained and tonally rich, the film could record the hues of fabric and skin, atmosphere and light and, until electronic imaging became dominant, it was the way we captured moments on camera. In the early 1990s, home slides started falling out of fashion. In 2009, Kodak discontinued the iconic color film for good.\n\nSince 2017, Shulman has collected over 700,000 Kodachrome slides as part of The Anonymous Project, a Paris-based non-profit initiative that gathers, scans, digitizes and catalogs color photographic negatives and slides produced since the mid-20th century. It's now one of the world's most extensive collections of amateur slides.\n\n\"Each slide is a glimpse into our collective memory,\" Shulman said.\n\nIndeed, the photos -- all taken by amateurs, with varying degrees of photographic ability -- show situations familiar to most of us. There are pictures of newborn babies and first days of school, parties and family vacations, first dances and weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and older couples.\n\nThroughout, there's a sense of normalcy -- and the feeling that we haven't greatly changed the way we document our lives.\n\n\"As can be seen in these pages, people behaved with 35-millimeter cameras and Instamatics 50 years ago much as they do today with smartphones in the age of Instagram and Snapchat,\" writes arts critic Richard B. Woodward in the book's introduction. \"They took pictures of what they ate and drank, where they vacationed, how they celebrated.\" Just like we do today.\n\nThe filmmaker began collecting slides after buying a couple of 1950s Kodachrome boxes from eBay out of curiosity, and for very little money. When he opened them, he said he was \"stunned.\"\n\n\"I was suddenly staring at hundreds of pictures of strangers' lives in super vivid colors, despite the fact that they were over 60 years old. It was mind-blowing. I felt like I had to do something with them other than just keep them to myself. The whole idea for The Anonymous Project snowballed from there.\"\n\nAlthough most of the color negatives remain vibrant, their shelf life is limited. Shulman said they aren't meant to survive longer than 50 years, as the chemicals on the film degrade over time -- which is why he's scanning as many as he can.\n\nNo captions, background information or specifics, like dates or times, accompany the frames, mostly because when Shulman acquired them they didn't come with any.\n\n\"Even in the rare instances I've had some access to the history of these snapshots, I decided to leave it out. For me, this is an interpretative experience,\" he said.\n\n\"It sounds cheesy, but I think these images really show how, even when we are so diverse, we still have similar ambitions, hopes, goals. And how we go through the same things. Looking at them is like realizing you're part of one big family.\"\n\nFor the book, Shulman selected photos according to his own personal inclinations, choosing those that spoke to him emotionally or visually. The frame of the laughing ladies was one. Another \"favorite\" depicts a young woman intently staring at the camera, as someone -- her lover, Shulman speculates -- is taking her photo. She's serious, but there's a certain tenderness to her whole demeanor.\n\nThe filmmaker applies that same subjective approach to The Anonymous Project's website and exhibitions, especially as the collection continues to expand.\n\nShulman said people from all over the world have sent him boxes of old Kodachrome slides, some of which have been forgotten for years in their attics.\n\n\"We have such a vast range of images now,\" he explained. \"Some resonate with me at certain times, some at others. So what the public see changes often.\"\n\nWhile \"Midcentury Memories\" finally publishes the images in book form, there may be much more to come from the project. \"There's a strong interest from people in exploring our collective memory,\" Shulman said. \"Today more than ever.

To pull this off is to be a master of distraction.\"\n\nRelated video: Photographer Martin Parr on Britain in the time of Brexit\n\nBeing able to sense \"that moment when reality quivers with photographic possibility,\" is also what makes the featured Magnum photographers streetwise, McLaren points out.\n\n\"Unlike photojournalism, which involves a very strict way of telling stories, permits and so on, street photography is more instinctual, and almost allows for more artistic leeway,\" he explained. \"These images all share that quality.\"\n\nThe photos in \"Magnum Streetwise\" tell diverse micro-stories specific to their authors and settings -- for example, a girl on Tokyo's metro, captured by Gueorgui Pinkhassov in 1996 and pigeons scattering over Trafalgar Square in London, by Sergio Larrain circa 1958.\n\nOthers are extended works of observation, like Herbert List's contemplation of the limited view from his window in the summer of 1953 in Rome, when a foot injury kept him confined to his apartment.\n\nA shot taken by Herbert List from the window of his Rome apartment, where he was confined with a foot injury at the time. Credit: Herbert List/Magnum Photos\n\n\"Video, VR and new technologies are increasingly shaping the way we approach and digest what's around us,\" McLaren said, \"but street photography is shrouded in a sense of mystery hard to replicate. And it's still very much a relevant expression of how the world works.\"\n\n\"Street pictures don't give out or tell you what you're seeing. They make you ask questions, and ask yourself 'What happening here?' They suggest that not everything is as it might seem.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/magnum-street-photography-stephen-mclaren/index.html", "published": "2019-12-02T04:28:26+00:00"}, {"title": "Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change", "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nFor the last decade, Thomas Sauvin has been purchasing discarded color negatives by the kilogram from a recycling plant outside Beijing. The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.\n\nThe trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.\n\nQuite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.\n\nHis ongoing \"Beijing Silvermine\" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.\n\n\"The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,\" he said in a phone interview. \"There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.\"\n\nWhile the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half \"looking for gems,\" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.\n\nMost of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.\n\nThe pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.\n\n\"I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,\" Sauvin said. \"You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.\n\n\"But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.\"\n\nRecurring themes\n\nWhat remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls \"the ritual\" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.\n\nSome common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.\n\nNew ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (\"Go around the world in just one day,\" its catalog boasted).\n\nWhat initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.\n\n\"It seems to be quite a meaningful place,\" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. \"It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.\"\n\nFading memories\n\nSauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.\n\nThe image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (\"like a mermaid,\" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he \"knew the guy like he was my grandfather.\"\n\nAfter Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.\n\n\"He was very happy, and we had a very good time,\" Sauvin said. \"In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'\"\n\nAlthough now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a \"still very reasonable\" 75 yuan (just under $11).\n\n\"It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,\" he said. \"But that's part of the game, I suppose.\"\n\nThe supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.\n\n\"I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,\" Sauvin recalled. \"And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'\"\n\nHe took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.\n\nSauvin's latest project brings together found photos of athletes from a single day in 1960.

All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.\n\n\"I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,\" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, \"Great Leaps Forward.\"\n\n\"The photos were simply beautiful -- very calm, very poetic. The athletes seemed to overcome gravity,\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/china-beijing-silvermine-negatives/index.html", "published": "2019-11-15T04:32:08+00:00"}, {"title": "The photographer who captured Hollywood's last wild decade", "text": "Written by Ana Rosado, CNN\n\nIt isn't unusual for a Hollywood native like Randall Slavin to grow up wanting to be an actor.\n\nBut hanging out with promising young stars steered Slavin in a different direction: photography.\n\nDuring the 1990s, armed with an Olympus Stylus camera, he became the visual chronicler of Hollywood's young celebrities -- the last pre-internet generation of musicians and actors, like Hilary Swank and Charlize Theron, who at that time were still trying to make it in the business.\n\nThe magic of soul and funk in the seventies\n\n\"I think I was hyper aware that I was around special people,\" Slavin wrote in his book, \"We all want something beautiful.\"\n\nThe book charts Slavin's career, from candid photos of his on-the-verge-of-stardom friends to his latest glossy works, revealing his aptitude for capturing unguarded emotion. Each page is filled with familiar faces, like Lindsay Lohan, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Garner, Amber Heard, Rose McGowan and Tara Reid.\n\n\"One of my main focuses is to get people to forget they're being photographed, because that's what makes people feel stiff,\" he said in a phone interview. \"It's a joy to spend some time with these legends, so I want to use the time I have to get to know them... I like to talk a lot during my shoots.\"\n\nBorn and raised in LA, Slavin had wanted to become an actor. He compared Hollywood to Pachinko, a Japanese game that resembles a pinball machine: \"Everyone comes (here) wanting to be an actor and then they slowly filter down and find their slot.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, he had minor roles in blockbuster films, like \"Primal Fear\" and \"Legends of the Fall,\" but to support his acting dreams Slavin needed other side gigs. In his early 20s, he was working at a Chevron gas station in La Cienega, in Hollywood, when he decided to try his hand at taking photos.\n\nHe befriended the owner of a headshot photography studio across the street, who gave him some basic pointers, and soon after he was taking headshots of his friends -- including Hilary Swank, who, in one picture, had just chopped her hair off to express contempt for having been fired from the hit TV show \"Beverly Hills 90210.\"\n\n\"I was very fortunate that a lot of my friends... let me experiment on them, and it helped when they blew up and became movie stars. I certainly had a leg up on a lot of other photographers who were starting out,\" Slavin said.\n\nThe first celebrity portrait he took was of The Black Crowes' lead singer Chris Robinson at his \"hippie paradise in the hills above Sunset Boulevard,\" and Charlize Theron, a longtime friend, once invited him to tag along and document a trip to South Africa.\n\n\"I was breathing rarefied air, and I wanted to remember every single moment,\" Slavin wrote in the book.\n\nWith his camera in hand, Slavin seemed to be in all the right places at the right time. He captured an image of Leonardo DiCaprio -- right before the film \"Titanic\" was released -- hanging out with Theron at her birthday party in Hollywood's iconic Bar Marmont.\n\n\"You had these incredible places with people relaxing and letting their hair down,\" he explained. \"I don't know if that happens anymore.\"\n\nGoing through his archive, Slavin also found a few surprising faces: \"Six years before his breakthrough in 'Hustle and Flow,' Terrence (Howard) was at my birthday party. I didn't know him. I just held the camera aloft to get a shot. Years later I looked at the picture and realized he was looking directly into the camera,\" Slavin wrote in \"We all want something beautiful.\"\n\nSocial media has kicked the doors of Hollywood wide open, but Slavin's photos give insight into a time when celebrities could party in relative privacy.\n\nActor James Van Der Beek appears in the background of one photo, wearing a beard, glasses and a baseball cap. It was 1999 and he'd already shot to fame as Dawson Leery in \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\n\"Everything about it says, 'Pay no attention to the confused boy in the too-baggy jacket,'\" Van Der Beek said in an Instagram post, noting that Slavin's images captured a time before everyone carried a camera in their pockets.\n\nSlavin agreed. \"Everybody thinks their 20s were a special time, but I also think it was a special time because it was right before the internet, social media and cellphones. Those three things came along and privacy went out the window,\" he said.\n\nIt isn't easy to make it in Hollywood as an actor but it's equally hard to start out as a photographer.\n\nIn Slavin's case, his craft was given a boost by an all-access pass to the life of his Hollywood friends. But he wasn't driven by dreams of exposure. Slavin's early black and white images were simply intended as a visual diary of the great times they were all living.\n\n\"I was very fortunate to be at the right place in some very magical times,\" he said.\n\nLA feels enormous but when you're here it's a small town, a small little company town, and everybody works for the same factory.\"\n\n\"We all want something beautiful\" is available now from Mascot Books.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/randall-slavin-celebrity-portraiture-hollywood/index.html", "published": "2019-11-14T14:56:50+00:00"}, {"title": "Steve McCurry's photos show the complex relationship between humans and animals", "text": "Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\n\nSteve McCurry has achieved legendary status with his documentary photography, and is perhaps best known for his portrait of the \"Afghan Girl\" with the piercing green eyes published in 1985.\n\nBut the influential American photographer, who has built his career around his daring coverage of armed conflict, has a lesser known passion: animals.\n\nThey are the subject of a new book simply called \"Steve McCurry.

For Parr, photography is \"almost like a form of therapy.\"\n\nWidely regarded as one of Britain's foremost photographers, the Magnum member's work is not limited to the United Kingdom. He, like most working photographers, also takes commissions. He's shot fashion campaigns for Gucci and was commissioned by CNN to photograph the Republican National Convention in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election. At the time, he told CNN: \"Until you get to these things, you never quite know what you're going to see.\n\n\"This is not boring, everyday life. This is people with extreme political convictions.\"\n\nHis photos often have a twisted sense of humor about them.

But he is insistent that while he has made his own position clear, his photography isn't one-sided, and can be interpreted in a number of ways.\n\n\"Everyone comes with their own baggage to pictures,\" he says. \"You know, I'm not going to change your point of view about anything politically, or on the Brexit front or to what extent you want to support climate change or extension rebellion.\n\n\"If you have your opinions and your prejudice and your baggage, you're bound to find arguments within my pictures to support them.\"\n\nThe Black Country, West Bromwich, England. \"St George's Day.

The rest is on display 10 kilometers away at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), a prestigious school that has produced multiple generations of leading Chinese artists since its founding a century ago.\n\nFor another, the Mumbai-born British sculptor doesn't consider a collaboration with a respected Chinese arts institution as somehow incompatible with his activism. After threatening to pull out of the 2016 Yinchuan Biennale over its exclusion of Ai Weiwei's work, and turning down opportunities to exhibit in China over the dissident artist's treatment, Kapoor now says it is time to be \"part of the conversation.\"\n\n\"I understand your question about being politically outspoken -- about standing up, as I have done, against, if you like, oppression,\" he says during an interview at the CAFA Art Museum. \"I have to mediate (this) in relation to showing in China.

Rather, he has always been more concerned with confronting dualities through his work -- bold, challenging creations that are at once smooth and textured, convex and concave, reflective and absorbent.\n\nThese contrasts are widely explored in his Beijing retrospective. Bringing together some of his most celebrated sculptures and installations, it's a body of work that spans 35 years -- a time in which Kapoor has been knighted, won the coveted Turner Prize and represented the UK at the Venice Biennale.\n\nThe most ambitious artworks are set across three floors of CAFA's on-campus museum. Chief among them is \"Destierro,\" an entire room transformed into a surreal red landscape, and \"My Red Homeland,\" a circular mass of wax almost 40 feet across around which a steel block, propelled by a motorized arm, slowly rotates.\n\nA motorized arm at the center of \"My Red Homeland\" circles at a rate of one rotation per hour.

It is here that visitors find Kapoor's curvilinear experimentation with stainless steel, alongside abstract objects that seem to emerge from -- or disappear into -- the the floor beneath them.\n\n\"Of course, it's true to the work that I've made, but it has some relation with the site,\" Kapoor said of the decision to exhibit in this unusual setting, adding that he likes \"the idea of this non-art space.\"\n\n\"So one building has a group of pigment works from late '70s to the early '80s, (and) one building has the big work called \"Angel,\" which is a series of pigment stones, kind of floating in the space.\"\n\nMade between 1979 and 1980, \"1000 Names\" is one of the earliest works included in Kapoor's retrospective.

So while Kapoor stresses that his latest exhibition isn't specifically designed for Chinese audiences, he is acutely aware that his work may be received differently.\n\n\"China, as we all know, has a very long deep history of (the) color red itself. And I think that makes (the art a) kind of strange bridge ... which I hope engages something in the Chinese context, in the Chinese psyche.

It's just one of a new breed of neo-Ottoman buildings now popping up all around the country.\n\n\"When we speak of a neoclassical mosque, there are three things that come to mind: minarets, domes and arches,\" explains Ergin K\u00fcl\u00fcnk, president of the mosque's construction association.\n\nTo mitigate Camlica Mosque's vastness, K\u00fcl\u00fcnk said, the designers employed \"light, color, glass, ornamentation and calligraphy,\" which have a \"softening\" impact on the space. \"We tried to make people not be overwhelmed by the physical hugeness, but make them feel more spiritual,\" K\u00fcl\u00fcnk says.\n\n\u00c7aml\u0131ca Mosque is now Turkey's largest mosque.

Associate professor at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University's history department, Ahmet Ersoy, says: \"I think it's one of the means by which the government is able to propagandize its leadership position in the Islamic world.\n\n\"It seems with this new cut-and-paste type of architecture, the general approach is 'the bigger, the better,'\" Ersoy continues. \"I think there's now a popular demand to reconnect to a glorious imperial past.\"\n\nA view of the ward-winning Sancaklar Mosque designed by Turkish architect Emre Arolat.\n\nNonetheless, a number of the country's new mosques -- like the award-winning Sancaklar Mosque, designed by Turkish architect Emre Arolat -- appear to be distancing themselves from politics. Rather than evoking historical styles, they take a more minimalist architectural approach.\n\nA view of the ward-winning Sancaklar Mosque designed by Turkish architect Emre Arolat.\n\n\"It's a simple-looking atmosphere but I believe that there is a specific aura in this interior,\" Arolat says of his design, which was constructed in suburban Istanbul. \"There (are) not any big ornaments, there is no very powerful light -- light is coming from the 'qibla' wall (which faces the direction of Mecca). The only ornament of the building is the light, in my opinion.\n\n\"You will find that there is not any definition in any Islamic writing or even in the Quran about the form of a mosque,\" he adds. \"It was very enlightening for me to discover this. I think that this space somehow prepares you to be alone with God.\"\n\nThe Turkish government had not responded to CNN's request for comment at the time of publication.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/turkey-new-ottoman-mosques/index.html", "published": "2019-10-25T10:08:29+00:00"}, {"title": "Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change", "text": "Temujin Doran, CNN Thomas Page , CNN Written by\n\nFor an artist who deals in ephemera, Olafur Eliasson likes to take the long view. Outside the gallery, he fears humanity is transfixed on now at the expense of tomorrow -- and warns that obsession could be at the expense of the planet.\n\nEliasson has returned to London for what he calls his \"mid-career survey,\" assembling three decades of work, some new, in the Tate Modern for exhibition \"In Real Life.\" It marks a spiritual return to the gallery that hosted what is perhaps still his crowning achievement, 2003's Turbine Hall installation \"The Weather Project.\"\n\nFrom suspended water droplets to restless light shows, the Icelandic-Danish artist has always placed transience at the heart of his elemental work. He bottles lightning, so to speak, so that we may appreciate its delicate majesty. And the delicacy of nature is coming into even sharper focus as the years pass.\n\nAn artist who says he's interested in the environment, rather than an environmental artist, visitors will see gathering momentum on the subject of climate change throughout his career.

We need to see accountability by politicians, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years (into the future), long after the politician's dead and gone.\"\n\nHe believes we have been let down by politicians and the private sector. \"I'm afraid we can't wait for them to do the work for us. Because they are not going fast enough,\" he argues.

One of the things that art can do -- and it's not the only thing -- is it can sort of bring a physical narrative to something that one knows.\"\n\nA new work, \"The presence of absence pavilion,\" conveys one such narrative.

He had been commissioned to design a symbol for the LGBTQ community by his friend Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California.\n\nBaker drew inspiration from the US national flag, which had celebrated its bicentennial in 1976, and an actual rainbow, which displays the colors of the light spectrum in roughly the same sequence as the flag. He assigned a meaning to each of the colors: hot pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for magic, blue for harmony and violet for spirit.\n\nThe first flag measured 30 by 60 feet and Baker, who was then 27 years old, had sewn it by hand. \"When it went up and the wind finally took it out of my hands, it blew my mind,\" he told CNN in a 2015 interview . \"I saw immediately how everyone around me owned that flag.

The line between street style and high fashion all but disappeared, with social media influencers launching trends, and fashion shows becoming Instagrammable moments.\n\nThere have also been societal shifts, with a profound move towards inclusivity in the fashion industry.\n\nNow, at the dawn of the 20s, let's take a moment to revel in the peak fashion moments of the last decade.\n\nPost-Soviet\n\nThe post-Soviet aesthetic played with village discoteque kitsch, mobster power suiting and knock-off sportswear scrawled with Cyrillic logos.\n\nSince Gvasalia was appointed creative director at Balenciaga in 2015, and alongside Russian label founder Gosha Rubchinskiy, his influence on haute streetwear has been seen everywhere from Off-White to Topshop, and spotted on celebrities from Kanye West and Rihanna to Whoopi Goldberg and Celine Dion -- who famously wore the label's bootleg-inspired oversized \"Titanic\" hoodie.\n\nMaximalism\n\nWhen Alessandro Michele took over at Gucci in 2015 -- via Fendi, Tom Ford and Richard Ginori, a Gucci-owned porcelain brand -- he threw out the brand's glamorous Milanese rulebook and introduced a joyful mash-up of eras and muses.\n\nThis eccentric, maximalist approach exuded an anything-goes, more-is-more energy and instantly saw both men and women reach for pussy-bow blouses, clashing prints, fur-lined loafers and geek-chic glasses, often all at once.\n\nChannel the glam rock of Elton John today and the Harlem hip hop swagger of Dapper Dan tomorrow?

French fashion designer Isabel Marant's Willow Wedge sneakers started the craze in 2012, which led to puffed-up must-haves such as the three-soled Balenciaga Triple S, the raver-ready Raf Simons x Adidas Ozweego, the sock cum sneaker Yeezy Boost 350, and the truly goofy Reebok InstaPump Fury.\n\nEven Buffalos made a comeback, as did the Spice Girls (not coincidentally).

Designers from Africa in particular got noticed for their authentic style, fusing traditional textiles with modern ideas.\n\nThis year South Africa's Thebe Magugu became the first designer from the continent to win the coveted LVMH Prize for young talent, and his contemporaries including Maki Oh, Kenneth Ize, Studio One Eighty Nine and MaXhosa have also broken through, thanks to the support of A-listers such as Solange, Michelle Obama and Naomi Campbell.\n\nStudio One Eighty Nine at New York Fashion Week 2019 Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nAndrogyny\n\nTuning in to the increasing awareness and debates about gender fluidity, many brands have developed collections that do away with his & hers. Avant garde designers such as Jonathan Anderson, Rick Owens, Eckhaus Latta and Rad Hourani focus on non-gendered designs, while high-street stores H&M and Zara offer unisex lines.\n\nNow transgender and non-binary personalities can shine, whether it's Caitlyn Jenner on the cover of Vanity Fair or Andreja Peji\u0107, Hanne Gaby Odiele and Hari Nef on the catwalk.\n\nLikewise, male style stars are more daring, with Jared Leto, Jaden Smith, Kanye West and Billy Porter all donning dresses -- and there's more experimentation on the men's runways, including Hood by Air's \"post-everything\" radical streetwear and Charles Jeffrey Loverboy's club kid riots.\n\nBilly Porter in a tuxedo dress at the Academy Awards in February. Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nPolitical Ts\n\nFashion has long used the humble T-shirt as a political canvas, and the 2010s certainly had plenty to protest about. Katharine Hamnett, pioneer of the fashion activist tee in the 1980s (she designed the oversized \"Choose Life\" shirts made famous by Wham!), returned with \"Cancel Brexit\" and \"Save Our Seas.\"\n\nAnother revival was \"The Future Is Female\" by Prabal Gurung, first coined in 1975 by NYC's Labyris Books (New York's first women's bookstore). From the same era and city, artist Jenny Holzer's truism \"Abuse of Power Comes As No Surprise\" became a #MeToo tee. And Maria Grazia Chiuri made her 2016 Dior debut by quoting Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: \"We Should All Be Feminists.\"\n\nDior unites feminism and high fashion\n\nDiversity\n\nRihanna has sparked countless trends, but with Fenty she also nailed the current mood for inclusivity. First came a make-up range for all skin tones in 2017, then an underwear brand for all body shapes, and now her LVMH ready-to-wear line that rallies for \"a worldwide community beyond traditional boundaries.\"\n\nSimilarly, designers Telfar Clemens and Pyer Moss champion the Black Lives Matter movement, British designer Grace Wales Bonner reimagines the black experience, Muslim American model Halima Aden has become the poster girl for modest fashion, and models Adwoa Aboah and Adesuwa Aighewi are advocates for diversity, self-love and mental health.

Or for Marc Jacobs to give white models cyberpunk dreadlocks for Spring-Summer 2016? How about Gucci's Autumn-Winter 2018 \"Indy Full Turban,\" which resembled Sikh sacred headwear? The answer, particularly to critics on social media, was a resounding no.\n\nBrands, in some cases, claimed their controversial items borrowed inspiration from other cultures and ethnicities. Others were quick to distance themselves and declare that steps would be taken to increase diversity on their teams.\n\nAnd in the 2010s, Diet Prada, the popular Instagram account, kept many labels in check -- calling out tactless and insensitive sartorial choices in real-time.\n\nKarlie Kloss walks the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

It. pieces that fuel fashion took on even greater voracity via social media.\n\nEveryone wanted Valentino's Rockstud heels, Jacquemus' Le Chiquito bag, Kenzo's tiger graphic sweatshirts, Supreme's logo T-shirts, Apple's AirPods and Adam Selman x Le Specs skinny sunglasses -- propelled of course by images of influencers paid to wear such items on IG.\n\nThe Phoebe Philo effect\n\nAs creative director at C\u00e9line from 2008 to 2018, Phoebe Philo defined the wardrobe for smart working women. The designer's clever tailoring, statement coats and comfortable footwear became collector's items, as bereft fans emptied the internet of her designs after her departure from the brand.\n\nThis elegant-meets-practical aesthetic (turtlenecks, tailored overcoats, sleek sneakers) continues to shape grown-up, feminine dressing today.\n\nAthleisure\n\nLuxurious sports and activewear was the biggest trend of the decade. Why? Because if the easy dress code of elevated sneakers and upscale sweats can take you from the office to date night, then why not?\n\nSo in the wake of the Lululemon yoga pant-wearing brigade, Gigi Hadid making cycling shorts a plausible style choice, and Virgil Abloh's \"Athlete in Progress\" collection with Nike, athleisure sprinted out of the starting gate and looks set to triumph well into the 2020s.\n\nGigi Hadid in New York. Credit: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images\n\nNormcore\n\nA term coined by trend agency K-Hole, normcore made looking absolutely non-descript feel anti-hype in 2014. In the same year that Chanel turned the Grand Palais into a supermarket -- the ultimate symbol of ordinariness -- for its Autumn-Winter show, everyone was wearing bland T-shirts and generic jeans by the likes of American Apparel and The Gap.\n\nThis trend also fed into fashion's warm embrace of Danish minimalism (raincoats, hygge-inducing cashmere, white sneakers) and Portland hipsters -- think lumberjack shirts, rolled-up trousers and impeccable beards.\n\n1990s\n\nThe Gen-Xers were inspiring millennials in a big way by the mid-teens, and the cherry picking was extensive. The neon baggies and bucket hats of acid house (Prada, Raf Simons), the logo mania of jungle music (Versace, Moschino), distressed jumpers and grunge band T-shirts (Hedi Slimane, Marc Jacobs) and the return of the original supermodels (Naomi, Cindy, Linda, Christy), bringing their bias-cut Calvin Klein slip dresses with them.\n\nSadly, fans of Hypercolor T-shirts (which, embarrassingly, changed color as the wearer sweat), haven't been satisfied with a re-launch, yet.\n\nSustainability\n\nToward the end of the decade, ethical fashion got serious. As Greta Thunberg berated world leaders for their inaction on climate change, eco designers were pushing upcycling, organic fabrics, faux fur and slow fashion. Pioneers such as Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood have been joined by newbies Bethany Williams and Ahluwalia Studio, and high-street initiatives like H&M Conscious.\n\nAs one of the most polluting global industries, fashion is very far from solving its environmental footprint, but clever innovations in textiles are an exciting way forward. For example, Pharrell Williams' collections with G-Star Raw include denim made using recycled plastic retrieved from the oceans.\n\nStella McCartneys faux fur items are intended to be sustainable and luxurious.

With a mother like Diana Ross, it's hard to imagine glamor and style being out of Ellis Ross' reach growing up.\n\nIn recent years, the star of popular TV show \"Black-ish\" has delighted onlookers with her bold personal style, both on the red carpet and on social media. Her Instagram account is a treasure-trove of fashion, musings on self-care and playful moments that have attracted a following of over 7 million.\n\nThis year, Ellis Ross launched an affordable haircare line, Pattern, which was over 10 years in the making.

Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nBeyond the obvious matters of utility and aesthetics, why is fashion important today?\n\nFor me, fashion started as a way to protect myself -- to have a bit of control over how the world perceives me. And I think, for many, that's still the case. I think fashion has evolved for me personally into a form of creative expression.\n\nThe business of fashion has great power. I think human culture is in a really interesting and fertile place right now, in terms of how we tell stories that actually reflect the truth of our humanity. And fashion is not exempt from that. Without using those annoying buzzwords like \"inclusion\" and \"diversity,\" I think we're really seeing the importance of how an art form -- and I do see fashion as an art form -- is meant to be a reflection of our humanity. Although, there's still a lot of growth needed, in terms of how we make sure that the stories we're telling through our art, through our fashion, or through the business, actually reflect the world that we live in.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross speaks onstage during the 2018 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California. Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/Getty Images For dcp\n\nWe've seen a number of high-profile examples of fashion brands getting this wrong, particularly in last 18 months. We've also seen lots of tokenism, whereby certain brands use \"inclusion\" and \"diversity\" as marketing tools.\n\nI think tokenism has been around for a very long time, as has cultural appropriation. (But) we're waking up to the responsibility of those kinds of images and the detrimental effects they have. Some people think the point of \"diversity and inclusion\" is to listen to other people's stories and then tell them yourself. That's not the point. I think the point is to realize that there are gaps and spaces and blind spots that you didn't realize, and it's not your job to fill them in but instead to allow those spaces to be filled by those many different kinds of voices.\n\nWhat you wear on stage will be a talking point. How do you go about selecting your outfits?\n\nMy aim, first and foremost, is to wear things that make my heart sing, and that I adore. It is always on my mind to be as inclusive as possible, but also to be respectful and appropriate to the environment that I'm in. So my intention is to wear nominated designers and British fashion designers.\n\nThe beauty of doing the fashion awards, for me personally, is that I don't have to play to the mainstream. I can play to those who understand volume and understand the decadence of certain designs and looks that wouldn't exactly work at a Vanity Fair party, or on the red carpet for the Golden Globes, but are dreamy clothing. So, you can expect a little bit of theater, and lots of joy. I know the fashion industry can sometimes be very serious, but one of my jobs on Monday night will be to bring an aspect of joy and celebration to the evening.\n\nEllis Ross pictured at the 61st Grammy Awards at Staples Center in February 2019. Credit: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images North America/Getty Images for The Recording A\n\nYou launched your own fashion haircare line, Pattern, earlier this year. You've said, more than once, that you could chronicle your journey of self-love through your hair. Can you explain what you mean by that?\n\nThe beauty industry, and beauty in and of itself, can seem like a purely aesthetical adventure ... in simply caring about what one looks like. But the truth is that the beauty industry and the culture of beauty is steeped in some very real things. I'm a black woman who has navigated her hair within a standard of beauty and a world that didn't really make space for what naturally and authentically comes out of my head.\n\nThe act of loving myself, and loving my physical appearance, has been a journey of activism and self-love. I realized through my own journey of loving and understanding my hair that there weren't the products to support it. I realized that this wasn't just me, that there were large demographics of people that had been excluded from what was considered beautiful.

Air conditioning is also essential to businesses and technologies that rely on controlled temperatures and humidity, such as the very internet servers that are sending this story to your device.\n\nBut this all comes at a cost: The cooling of our air is responsible for 10% of the planet's electricity consumption, according to the International Energy Agency . And as the world heats, demand for air conditioners will only grow, especially in developing countries. This, in turn, will increase the impact that cooling appliances have on the climate, thus warming the Earth further and creating a vicious cycle.\n\nThe current technology is unsustainable. That's why a new coalition -- led by India's government and America's Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a nonprofit environmental research organization -- has launched the Global Cooling Prize, a $1-million competition to design the next generation of air cooling systems.\n\n\"The first home air conditioner was brought to market in 1926 by Willis Carrier, who's long since dead,\" said RMI's managing director, Iain Campbell, in a phone interview. \"If we brought him back to life and showed him today's air conditioning product, not only would he know what it is, he could tell you how it works.\"\n\nAir conditioning units line a side of a building in downtown New Delhi. Credit: ROBERTO SCHMIDT via Getty Images\n\nThe prize\n\nThere are 1.2 billion room air conditioning units installed today, but that figure will soar to 4.5 billion by 2050, according to an RMI report . \"The impact of that on electricity demand is going to be huge,\" said Campbell, who co-authored the report. \"The dilemma is that it comes at an environmental cost we can't afford. It's a kind of climate threat you don't see much in the rear view mirror, but when you look at what's in front of you, it's massive,\"\n\nThe Global Cooling Prize sets specific guidelines for participants, who were tasked with designing a cooling solution with five times less climate impact than those popular today, meaning they could help counteract the environmental effects of the expected growth in demand.\n\nTo allow for this improved efficiency, proposed designs were allowed to be more expensive than current air conditioners (though no more than twice as much). The higher price would then, in theory, be offset by cheaper running costs. \"If a technology is twice as expensive and uses a quarter of the electricity, the simple payback is about two and a half years,\" explained Campbell.\n\nEntrants had to abide by seven additional rules, most of which were designed to prevent what Campbell called \"unintended consequences,\" such as excessive use of water or rare earth minerals, as well as limitations on fuel combustion and insulation.\n\nThe prize's judges have shortlisted eight finalists, who will now build functioning prototypes that will be tested both in a lab and in real-world conditions at an apartment block in Delhi. \"We're going to do a 60-day test at the peak of the Delhi summer,\" said Campbell. \"India will be the largest market for cooling over the next 30 years, going from under 14 million air conditioning units today to (nearly) a billion by 2050. They would need to double the size of their power system to achieve that.\"\n\nThe finalists\n\nThe competition attracted over 2,100 participants from 95 countries. From a long-list of 139 teams, eight finalists were awarded $200,000 to develop prototypes and ship them to India for testing in the summer of 2020.\n\nThree of the eight finalists are from India, three are from the US and one each from the UK and China. \"We have three major manufacturers, one university with a very advanced technology and then four smaller entities, coming at this from outside the industry with some very novel and different approaches,\" said Campbell.\n\nAn air conditioning unit is assembled at a factory in Jhajjar, India. Credit: SAJJAD HUSSAIN via Getty Image\n\nThe proposed designs employ a wide range of technologies, from vapor compression to evaporative cooling. Barocal, a Cambridge University spin-out startup, uses solid-state cooling technologies instead of traditional liquid refrigerants that may leak out over time. Meanwhile a proposal from Kraton, a Texan chemical engineering company, simply uses water, completely doing away with the main mechanical component of air conditioners, the compressor, to make the design more scalable and affordable.\n\nOther entrants focused on the limitations of current air conditioning units, such as the lack of control over both temperature and humidity at the same time. The design proposed by US startup M2 Thermal Solutions allows users to set both a specific temperature and the level of humidity in a room.\n\nIt's difficult to tell what these proposed new machines will look like before the actual prototypes are built, but it's arguable that they will also debut a new aesthetic, as most of the shortlisted designs are based on fundamentally different technology compared to traditional devices.\n\nThe challenge\n\nThe overall winner, announced in November 2020, will be awarded $1 million in prize money. This is when the real challenge begins: convincing the world that traditional air conditioners need replacing. \"The current A/C industry is worth more than $100 billion and has a well-established value chain -- from manufacturing to distribution to after-sales support,\" said Kraton's senior vice president, Vijay Mhetar, in an email. \"Any new design will need to have minimal barriers for customer adoption and have a similar supply chain established.\"\n\nWorkers install an airconditioning unit in a food stall in Shanghai. Credit: PETER PARKS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccording to Xavier Moya from Barocal and the University of Cambridge, the main challenge is to convince people to buy an air conditioner based on its performance and climate impact, rather than just its price. \"This change in consumer perception could be also aided by phasing out the sale of environmentally unsustainable designs,\" he added in an email.\n\nBut why has the air conditioner changed so little since it was invented back in 1902? According to Ryan Melsert, CEO of finalists M2 Thermal Solutions, it may be due to an \"out-of-sight out-of-mind\" attitude. \"These systems are all around us, in the closets and basements of our homes, in the utility rooms of our businesses, under the hoods of our vehicles,\" he said in an email. \"But because they are rarely seen, customers are tolerant of this lack of innovation.\"\n\nAir conditioners hang on the wall of an office building in Fuzhou, Fujiang Province of China. Credit: VCG/Getty Images AsiaPac/VCG via Getty Images\n\nOver the last century, the vast majority of industry investments have gone into making traditional designs cheaper, said Vijay Mhetar, although the best model in the market today only has a theoretical efficiency -- the ratio between heat removed and power used -- of 14%. That's low compared to more efficient technologies like lighting and solar panels, which today achieve 67% and 28% respectively in their fields, according to the RMI report.\n\n\"We believe a step change in performance will likely come from a radically new design, invented outside the industry,\" he said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/global-cooling-prize-india/index.html", "published": "2019-11-29T11:34:47+00:00"}, {"title": "The most notorious modern-day jewelry heists", "text": "Written by Alex Stambaugh, CNN\n\nTales of criminal masterminds swindling away diamonds, rubies and emeralds in elaborate robberies have captured Hollywood's imagination for decades.

The thieves are believed to have accessed the museum by cutting through a grille and breaking a window.\n\nWithin minutes, two suspects were seen moving through the gallery with flashlights, before smashing a display case and fleeing with priceless jewels containing diamonds, pearls and rubies.\n\nIt may not have been history's most sophisticated operation, but the Green Vault robbers join a long list of thieves making off with millions of dollars' worth of precious jewels.

The items date back to the early 17th century.\n\nAt the time, police said they could not comment on the value of the items stolen. But dean of the Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s parish, Christofer Lundgren, told CNN affiliate Expressen that their monetary value pales in comparison to their significance in Sweden's cultural history.\n\nThe thieves fled in an open-topped motorboat from the base of the church.

They then used a drill to bore through a six-foot-thick wall and enter the basement vault, investigators said at the time.\n\nFour men eventually went on trial, pleading guilty to conspiracy to burgle. The prosecution described the thieves, who were all aged above 40, as \"ringleaders and organizers\" of the crime.\n\nAt the time, media outlets had speculated the value of the haul could be in the vicinity of \u00a3200 million (then $303 million), though during the trial, prosecutors placed the value of the stolen property at \u00a314 million.\n\nCarlton Hotel\n\nA view of the Carlton hotel, in Cannes, southern France, the scene of a daylight raid.

Their one mistake: an incriminating half-eaten sandwich with DNA samples on it.\n\nAfter a months-long police operation involving detectives in several countries, the gangsters were eventually arrested, though most of the jewels were never recovered.\n\nGraff Jewelry Store\n\nA platinum diamond pendant was among the pieces of jewellery stolen from Graff's store in London's Bond Street.

The Dymaxion has garnered something of a cult following among an unlikely mix of people: car enthusiasts, architecture geeks and environmentalists. A 2011 documentary, \"The Last Dymaxion: Buckminster Fuller's Dream Restored,\" features famous fans waxing rhapsodic about the car's aesthetic and legacy.\n\nArchitect Normon Foster has prodcued his own recreation of the Dymaxion protoype. Credit: Nigel Young\n\nThe Dymaxion car doesn't look very much like a car, especially next to its contemporaries, those huge automobiles of the 1920s and 30s that manage to be simultaneously bulbous and boxy. That's because Fuller envisioned this prototype -- he resisted calling it a \"car\" -- as ultimately being able to travel not just on land, but in the air and underwater. Even more bizarre, it has three wheels, a rear-engine, and is big enough to fit a dozen passengers and a picnic.\n\nThe idea was thrilling enough to excite the cream of 1930s American society, including Amelia Earhart, Henry Ford and Isamu Noguchi. But only three Dymaxion car prototypes were ever produced, due to a high-profile, scandalous Dymaxion accident practically at the gates of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nEager for a closer look at what newspapers had branded a \"freak car,\" a Chicago South Park Commissioner drove too close and crashed his car into Dymaxion Prototype One.\n\nThe unwieldy prototype rolled over, killing the driver and injuring its passengers, a well-known Scottish spy and French government minister. The politician's car was removed from the fracas before police arrived, so the Dymaxion was blamed for the accident, according to books written about Fuller's eclectic designs.\n\nThe Dymaxion has garnered something of a cult following among an unlikely mix of people: car enthusiasts, architecture geeks, and environmentalists. Credit: National Automobile Museum\n\nRealizing that the Dymaxion would require significant improvements before it could be mass produced, Fuller set aside the car to focus on other projects (including a Dymaxion house, bathroom, map and more). Dymaxion Prototype Three was cut up for scrap metal in the 1950s and Prototype One, having been repaired after the aforementioned accident, later caught fire in a refueling accident.\n\nPrototype Two was lost, presumably forever, until its 1968 rediscovery on a farm by a group of Arizona State engineering students. The farmer, who had bought the car some years earlier for a dollar, was using it as a chicken coop and was happy to part with it for $3,000, pocketing a significant profit.\n\nEventually, the last surviving original Dymaxion was acquired by casino magnate Bill Harrah, whose extensive collection of exotic cars eventually became Reno's National Automobile Museum. I dropped in over the summer to check on the Dymaxion, which now looks much as Fuller intended. Over time, the museum's mechanics have restored the car's frame and curved paneling, which had been corroded by years of neglect (and chicken poop).\n\nAccording to museum director Jackie Frady, the cosmetic work has been completed: \"We're doing some research on the mechanics of it, trying to follow Fuller's design, to hopefully make it run again.\"\n\nRelated video: Antique cars with Tesla batteries\n\nNorman Foster has had more luck with his version of the Dymaxion, built in 2010 using Prototype Two as a model. \"The car is such a beautiful object that I very much wanted to own it, to be able to touch as well as contemplate the reality for its delight in the same spirit as a sculpture,\" the architect told CNN.\n\nFoster cleaved so closely to Fuller's original designs that he refers to his creation as a fourth genuine Dymaxion -- not a replica. \"Everything in (the car) was either made in 1934, or recreated using techniques and materials that Bucky would have had access to in that period,\" he said.\n\nToday, the Dymaxion might be a niche collector's object, but its legacy has permeated the contemporary world, \"triggering research projects about designing a new urban vehicle of the future,\" said Foster.\n\nThe obvious comparison is with Tesla, the most successful fusion to date of traditional car design and sustainable technology (and Fuller's brassy, audacious personality echoes that of famously divisive Tesla founder Elon Musk). Fuller's Dymaxion project is also \"paralleled by Google's current research to transform conventional cars into robotically controlled vehicles,\" Foster said.\n\nNorman Foster pictured at the wheel of his recreated Daymaxion. Credit: Nigel Young\n\nFuller's legacy is also clearly apparent in other, three-wheeled haute automobile projects, led by architects or product designers, like Zaha Hadid's hydrogen-powered Z-car, or the ill-fated Aptera electric vehicle.\n\nBut most relevant today is Fuller's commitment to sustainable design. \"Bucky was one of those rare individuals who fundamentally influenced the way that one comes to view the world,\" said Foster.\n\n\"He was the very essence of a moral conscience, forever warning about the fragility of the planet and our responsibility to protect it... His many innovations still surprise one with the audacity of the thinking behind them.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/dymaxion-auto-design/index.html", "published": "2019-10-31T03:38:55+00:00"}, {"title": "China's image of the 'ideal man'", "text": "Steven Jiang , CNN Beijing, China Written by\n\nThis feature is part of a wider CNN Style series on how culture in China is evolving in the Xi Jinping era.\n\nMusk Ming paints Chinese men in suggestive poses.

The soldiers' strong bodies and minds are touted as the ultimate male virtues, along with their fierce loyalty to the party -- qualities that some say Xi eagerly wants to promote as he vows to lead China into a great \"national rejuvenation.\"\n\nPropaganda poster decpits a People's Liberation Army soldier holding Mao Zedong's \"Little Red Book.\" Credit: GraphicaArtis/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nFor the first three decades of Communist rule, artistic depictions of Chinese men were dominated by heroic portrayals of PLA soldiers and, to a lesser degree, farmers and industrial workers -- two pillars of the proletariat class.\n\nAlthough some of the genre's works were created with ink, in a traditional Chinese style, the majority comprised neoclassical oil paintings or watercolors by artists who either studied overseas or were influenced by Western trends, according to You Yang, deputy director of the Beijing-based UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.\n\nNeoclassical art, which traces its origin to ancient Greece and Rome though it rose to prominence in 19th-century Europe, is known to feature male protagonists with accentuated muscles striking gallant poses.\n\nAfter 1949, Mao made it clear that \"all artwork must reflect the leadership of the Party and the will of the state,\" said You, explaining that neoclassicism found fertile ground in Communist societies -- first the Soviet Union and then China -- where artists used the style to fulfill their political duty of worshipping war heroes or strongman leaders.\n\nBeijing residents pass by a huge poster depicting two workers and one soldier.

Illustrating a turning point during the Red Army's famous Long March in the 1930s, the unknown artist depicted 10 young soldiers on a small boat as they charged toward enemy fire.\n\nTheir tanned, sinewy arms in various states of motion, half of the soldiers row the vessel against rapid currents and high waves, while their comrades point their guns at the banks -- a moment in time, captured before Communist troops clinched what they have since described as a miraculous victory against a bigger and better-armed enemy.\n\n\"Forcibly crossing the Dadu River\" by unknown artist.

In paintings, as well as on stage and on screen, all protagonists -- who were almost always men -- had to be \"red and bright\" to highlight their revolutionary credentials and heroism.\n\nThe result was an inevitably politicized masculinity, said You, represented by military men with sharp jawlines and muscular arms. Throwing their clenched fists into the air as they vowed to defeat the enemy, these heroes were devoid of any hint of sexuality, in line with the party's puritanical moral code.\n\nA Chinese Cultural Revolution poster encourages people to exercise in the \"big ocean,\" a metaphor for a large challenge.

Like South Korean K-pop stars, they boast slender figures and often wear cutesy expressions.\n\nIn a report released early this year, the online shopping platform of Chinese tech giant Alibaba found sales of men's cosmetic products jumped more than 50% in 2018, naming the popularity of \"pretty boys\" as a reason.\n\nBut after a period of social liberalization in the post-Mao era, there are signs that Xi's government is beginning to turn against male role models deemed too effeminate. A widely cited commentary , published last year by state-run Xinhua news agency, said: \"Whether a country embraces or rejects (effeminate men) is ... a grave matter that affects the nation's future.\"\n\nActor and singer Lu Han performs at a New Year's countdown party in 2016 in Shenzhen, China.

Credit: VCG/Visual China Group/VCG via Getty Images\n\nThere have also been user-generated online campaigns calling for some celebrities to be banished from the country's airwaves and internet platforms because of how they look. The government also seems to be tightening restrictions on what is seen on screen.\n\nEarlier this year, China's major video-streaming platforms began censoring male actors' earrings, blurring their earlobes. Incidentally, the ban came after censors prohibited the depiction of same-sex relationships on television and online, along with a wide range of what China calls \"vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content\" that also includes incest and one-night stands.\n\nSome targeted celebrities, including TFBoys, have responded to critics by ditching cosmetics and flowery wardrobes in favor of showing toned muscles in photo shoots.\n\nAnother trend has been the launch of a growing number of so-called \"masculinity programs\" aimed at instilling traditional gender roles in boys and young men through outdoor sports and classroom training. Last year, one such club in Beijing attracted attention -- and some criticism -- for having its students run shirtless in the dead of winter. \"There is a crisis in boys' education and I threw myself into practical actions to save them and help them find their lost masculinity,\" the Boys' Club founder told the South China Morning Post.\n\n\"'Sissy men' are under attack because they are perceived to be challenging the traditional notion of manliness,\" said Fang Gang, an associate professor at Beijing Forestry University whose research focuses on gender studies and sex education.\n\nFang points out that, ironically, the current controversy is partly due to recent progress made by sexual minorities in China. Activists say a nascent but increasingly visible LGBTQ rights movement is slowly changing hearts and minds, encouraging greater social acceptance.\n\n\"Some parents extend their worries about perceived gender-neutral appearances by linking it to homosexuality,\" he said. \"Greater social acceptance of the gay community has only deepened fears among homophobic people, making them more anxious and afraid of non-mainstream masculinity.\"\n\nOthers suspect a more direct link between the crackdown on \"sissy men\" and top officials' worldviews, which for many were shaped during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe strongman\n\nPresident Xi's attitude towards masculinity may trace back to his youth, which, from the late 1960s to mid-1970s, was spent in the Chinese countryside along with as many as 17 million other high school students and graduates. They were part of the \"sent-down\" generation relocated to the country's far-flung corners to learn agricultural and political lessons from poverty-stricken peasants.\n\n\"In the summer, I was almost sleeping in a pile of fleas -- all the bites and subsequent scratching turned my whole body swollen,\" he wrote in 2002. \"But after two years, I became used to it and could sleep through the night no matter how much I got bitten.\"\n\nChinese men in military uniforms reading from Mao's \"Little Red Book\" before starting their day. Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe Chinese leader's definition of manliness also has a political dimension. During a meeting with officials in southern China just months after taking power, Xi reportedly lamented the lack of strong convictions among Soviet communists when their party was on the verge of collapse. He was widely quoted by overseas Chinese-language media as saying that: \"In the end nobody was a real man, nobody came out to resist.\"\n\nXi's government seems determined to resist the perceived feminization of Chinese men through regulations and propaganda.\n\nIn a sign of a tightened political environment, artist Ming was reluctant to acknowledge the sensitivity of his art, which includes an almost-naked portrayal of the iconic PLA soldier from the Cultural Revolution-era opera \"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy.\"\n\n\"Strength is needed -- with muscles -- for militaries, revolutions and the proletariat, which means manual labor,\" said Ming. \"But in traditional Chinese art and literature, male beauty is about being delicate, pale and pretty,\" he added, pointing to a contradiction in the way men have been depicted through history.\n\n\"I paint from a Chinese perspective -- and my work is on a continuum of Chinese aesthetics,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Ming's website remains blocked in China and the artist doesn't foresee his work being exhibited in his home country anytime soon. The cultural tradition that inspired him appears increasingly incompatible with the muscular strength appreciated and projected by the Chinese leader at home and abroad.\n\n\"Tiger Mountain\" by Musk Ming. His paintings combine the traditional ideal man in Communist China -- the PLA soldier -- with homosexuality, which remains a taboo subject.

Nevertheless, Ming anticipates an eventual change of guard in leadership -- and the impact it could have on cultural attitudes.\n\n\"The older generation finds it harder to accept new things ... it applies to not just 'sissy men' but many other things,\" he said. \"I think we need time.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/china-masculinity-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2019-10-25T23:26:19+00:00"}, {"title": "The people making million-dollar art deals for the super rich", "text": "Written by Nick Glass, CNN\n\n\"I'm always flying by the seat of my pants,\" says Lisa Schiff with engaging and, I suspect, characteristic honesty. \"I never know what we're going to make each month -- five dollars or a million!\"\n\nShe works mostly on commission.\n\nAn art academic until the age of 30, Schiff's initial ambition was to be an art professor.

They help negotiate deals, and bid on clients' behalf at auctions. But equally, they help manage collections, loans, exhibits and legacies, introducing collectors to galleries and artists.\n\nas relatively small. But it's become a huge business, with global art sales reaching an estimated Susannah Pollen, who has been an art adviser in London since 2004, still regards the art world -- even the international one --as relatively small. But it's become a huge business, with global art sales reaching an estimated $67.4 billion in 2018 , according to the annual report by Clare McAndrew of Arts Economics.\n\nSusie Pollen has been an art adviser in London since 2004. Credit: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Sotheby's\n\nAs the American businessman and now adviser Steven Murphy puts it: Access to art has become \"as ubiquitous as music; the internet has changed the game.\" In the last 20 years, big art fairs have multiplied. The so-called mega dealers -- Gagosian, David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth and Pace -- now have galleries spread across the world. As a result, a \"new breed\" of art advisers has proliferated. One art adviser suggested that there may be as many as 100 in London alone.\n\nHow do art auctions really work?\n\nSchiff says that when she was starting there were hardly any art advisers. Now she meets new ones every day. And interestingly, it seems most of them are women, including approximately 80% of the Association of Professional Art Advisers' directory.\n\nHaving an art history degree, auction house experience and, perhaps most critical of all, knowledge of where things can be found (like who owns this Picasso or that Francis Bacon triptych) clearly has increasing value.\n\nA watershed moment for the industry took place in 2016: Sotheby's acquired Art Agency, Partners , a small private advisory firm in New York. The agency had been founded just two years earlier by Amy Cappellazzo and Allan Schwartzmann, both admired for their knowledge and business savvy. Sotheby's paid an astounding price -- $50 million plus up to $35 million in performance incentives. Art Agency, Partners apparently had a client list to die for.\n\nSchiff remembers waking that morning to hear the news. \"F*** me! I want to be Amy Cappellazzo!\n\n\"What a f***ing move,\" she exults down the line. \"So art advisers are valuable. What huge endorsement -- $85 million!\" She promptly rang Cappellazzo to congratulate her.\n\nFrom left: Amy Cappellazzo, Allan Schwartzman and Adam Chinn of Art Agency, Partners in New York, January 2016. Credit: Alex Welsh/The New York Times/Redux\n\nMurphy, who served as Chief Executive of Christie's between 2010 and 2015, and now heads his own art advisory company, Murphy & Partners, says that you should take as much care choosing an art adviser as you do choosing \"your personal banker, attorney, physician or psychoanalyst.\" One of his clients refers to the agency as his \"art shrink.\"\n\n\"The art world has exploded and like any other endeavor, why wouldn't you have a trusted guide to help you?\" says Murphy, teasing out a metaphor. \"Would you go on safari on horseback in Botswana without somebody in front of you who not only has gone down that path before but loves it?\"\n\n\"So it's a jungle out there?\" I suggest. He nods smilingly.\n\nSteven Murphy at his office in London. Credit: David Bebber/David Bebber/David Bebber\n\nMurphy won't be drawn into talking about money. Well, not too much, anyway. The service \"really is bespoke\" and \"fees range enormously.\" One-third of his clients are American, with one-third European and one-third Asian. What's clear is that some of them have tens of millions of dollars to spend. \"Oh, yeah,\" Murphy says, \"we are blessed that some of our clients are collecting masterpieces.\"\n\nWhen I press him, he mentions negotiating the private sale of a $25-million Monet landscape to an Asian collector. And the quick-fire sale of a small Francis Bacon portrait, for $4 million, to another buyer. In the case of the Bacon, the client had wanted to sell \"very quickly for personal reasons.\"\n\nThe deal was done within two weeks.\n\nThe fact is, we rarely get to glimpse at the inner workings of the art market. Pollen, who has been art advising for longer than most, says it's \"a highly unregulated industry.\" She believes in greater transparency and a code of ethics.\n\nPollen works freelance from her home in London's Notting Hill, mostly on annual retainers. Her current clientele is select -- fewer than 20, she says, declining to name them. \"Discretion is 100% paramount,\" she adds. But Pollen still manages to convey the thrill of the chase -- tracking down works of art and getting them for a good price.\n\nPollen is \"at the beck and call\" of a small handful longstanding clients; \"there has to be a dialogue; they've got to love art.\" And critically for her, \"they have real commitment. They react!,\" she says emphatically. Also an important part of the job, she says, is to restrain clients from paying too much and advising them \"what not to buy.\"\n\nAn early career highlight was the 1990 sale of \"The Crucifixion\" by Stanley Spencer for \u00a31.3 million ($1.6 million) -- then a record for a modern British artist (although long since eclipsed by Lucian Freud, Pollen spent nearly 22 years at Sotheby's, rising to senior director of Sotheby's Europe and head of 20th century British Art.An early career highlight was the 1990 sale of \"The Crucifixion\" by Stanley Spencer for \u00a31.3 million ($1.6 million) -- then a record for a modern British artist (although long since eclipsed by Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and others).\n\nAs an art adviser, Pollen has bid \u00a35 million ($6.1 million) for a Peter Doig painting at auction for a client, but she was narrowly outbid. She won't name the painting but rather ruefully says that it's probably now worth \u00a325 million ($31 million).\n\nPollen is excited by one particular new project. She's just been given first access to an extraordinary private collection of British art from the 1930s to '50s, including works by English painter Ben Nicholson, sculptor Barbara Hepworth and others, some of which haven't been seen for 80 years or so. She estimates the value at \u00a320 million ($25 million) and will advise the client on how best to sell it -- privately, through an auction house or by giving some works to the nation in return for a tax break.\n\nJo Baring, an ex-Christie's director, also works from home in Notting Hill. She has been a freelance adviser since 2013, and also has \"a handful of long-term clients.\"\n\n\"They don't want 'yes' men, they want your opinion,\" she says, adding with certain English understatement: \"Serious collectors can be quite demanding.\"\n\nJo Baring next to \"Fountain Figure\" (1959) by Bernard Meadows. Credit: Phil Adams\n\nUnusually for an art adviser, Baring is prepared to talk about one of her clients -- one she inherited from Pollen.\n\nShe describes Chris Ingram, a leading British collector of modern British and contemporary art, as a canny businessman and a passionate, obsessive collector. \"He thought to begin with, it was fun,\" she says. \"He didn't realize that he was swimming with sharks.\"\n\nIngram admitted to Baring that he got carried away bidding at auction. There was a \"passionate chase\" after \"Walking Madonna,\" a bronze masterpiece by Elizabeth Frink. He first bid for one (of the edition of three sculptures) at Christie's in 2002 but didn't get it; it went for \u00a3182,000. He was luckier the second time around, in 2006, but paid \u00a3377,000, rather more than he expected. Since then he has left the bidding to his art advisers.\n\nBaring always bids discreetly at auctions. \"I never do it in person in the room. I am in the room but on my phone, so no one can see I am bidding,\" she says. That way, she can see \"who else is there, who is bidding, get a flavor of the room and the sale.\" She can also protect her client and stay \"one step removed from the gossip.\"\n\nBaring stresses the need to do your homework. \"The dealers need to know that you are serious -- that you are not mucking around,\" she says. And as a rule of thumb, she believes that you should \"trust no one\" in the contemporary market. Sometimes dealers try to \"cut you out\" and go direct to the collector. Ingram, she says, always re-directs them to her.\n\nBoth Pollen and Baring are concerned about how women art advisers are sometimes perceived -- as young arriviste arts graduates with Louboutins and big bags, eagerly roaming the aisles of art fairs.\n\nPollen says that a lot of people think art advising is \"an easy, cool profession.\"\n\n\"But what training or deep knowledge do they (your adviser) have?\" she said. \"It is not enough to have a subscription to Artnet (the price data base) and a mobile phone.\"\n\nAnother London-based art adviser, Beth Greenacre, worked with David Bowie for 16 years until his death in 2016. 'I learned so much,\" she says. \"David was amazing, passionate about everything. I don't think he ever slept, always collecting information.\"\n\nBowie collected post war British modern art, including works by Peter Lanyon, Alan Davie and David Bomberg. He would bid in person at auctions. Greenacre says Bowie visited British artists -- including Eduardo Paolozzi and John Bellany -- in their studios, and was friends with Damien Hirst.\n\nBowie had a huge art library at his home in New York, and would devour books omnivorously. \"He looked and looked,\" says Greenacre, who would regularly bid anonymously at auctions on his behalf.\n\nAfter Bowie's death, she helped prepare part of his art collection for sale at Sotheby's in London.\n\nOne of the top lots was Frank Auerbach's 1965 painting \"Head of Gerda Boehm,\" which sold for almost \u00a33.8 million ($4.7 million). Over mint tea in a women-only private members' club in London's Mayfair, Greenacre recounts Bowie's memorable words on the painting: \"I want to sound like that looks.\"\n\nLondon-based art advisor, Beth Greenacre, worked with David Bowie for 16 years until his death in 2016.\n\nGreenacre says she has witnessed dramatic changes in the art market since she started out 20 years ago. Back then it was \"incredibly different -- middle-aged white guys running things from Cork Street\" (an art gallery hub near London's Piccadilly). Things are shifting. Some artists are simply dispensing with having a gallery at all. The business model is changing, resulting in reduced footfall for the small and middle-sized dealerships squeezed out by the mega-galleries.\n\n\"Why are so many women working as art advisers?\" I ask Greenacre. She pauses for a moment and then answers: \"We listen. We're great with people. We collaborate. We dig deep. We're persistent.\" Then she laughs out loud.\n\nIn a move that's aroused much interest in the art world, mega-dealer Larry Gagosian has just set up a separate new advisory arm in New York. It's being run by former Christie's executive, Laura Paulson. Her husband, Andrew Fabricant meanwhile oversees Gagosian's 17 exhibition spaces.\n\nBut how precisely will Gagosian Art Advisory operate? Are lines being blurred between the roles of an independent art adviser, who is not supposed to hold any stock, and an art dealer or gallerist, who often hold a lot? The art market is curious to see how it will work.\n\nSchiff views the art market as \"a very fragile eco-system -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- the auction houses, the galleries, the museums, the artists. Everybody has to come together to make the magic happen.\" But \"some of the machinations behind the scenes are so disgusting,\" she declares without elaborating. She tries to protect her clients, \"to buffer them a bit,\" by sparing them the \"ugly side,\" the wheeler-dealer.\n\nActor Leonardo DiCaprio attends the 2016 Frieze Art Fair: New York at Randall's Island on May 4, 2016 in New York City. Credit: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images\n\nSchiff sees her role as actively \"getting in the head of my clients, helping them find the best of what they love.\"\n\nHer most famous client to date was Leonardo DiCaprio. She no longer works with him. \"He was a bit different. He came with a collection,\" she says. But she is fulsome in her praise. \"He's got a great eye. He was always the best artist in the room. He just performed. A great story-teller. He taught me partnership.\"\n\nDown the line from New York, Schiff sounds almost star-struck. '\"I loved working with Leo. I miss Leo,\" she says plaintively.\n\nIf you are reading this, Mr. DiCaprio, why not get in touch again?", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/art-advisers-inside-the-art-buying-world/index.html", "published": "2019-10-07T11:22:33+00:00"}, {"title": "'Post-weird': How Chinese architecture evolved in the Xi Jinping era", "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nThis feature is part of a wider CNN Style series on how culture in China is evolving in the Xi Jinping era.\n\nFour years into the construction of Beijing's tallest skyscraper , its architects received an unexpected request from the city's authorities.\n\nDespite already being more than half built -- and despite the fact its shape was explicitly based on a \"zun,\" a ceremonial wine vessel popular in the Shang dynasty -- the tower needed to be more \"Chinese.\"\n\n\"Apparently, the client got a call from the vice mayor's (office) saying they were doing a review of all new construction in Beijing,\" recalled Robert Whitlock, design principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF), the US-owned architecture practice behind the 1,731-foot skyscraper. \"And (they) thought that the flat top of the building wasn't Chinese enough.\"\n\nOver the following months, the firm held a series of meetings with city planners to negotiate last-minute changes to the design. While the architects resisted what they saw as \"literal\" interpretations of Chinese culture, officials pointed to pagodas and temple roofs as sources of inspiration, said KPF director, Li Lei.\n\n\"One of the suggestions (was) to look at the Temple of Heaven -- whether there was a way for us to interpret the traditional elements of the tiered roof ... somehow, and put it on top of the building,\" Li said, \"which we immediately thought wouldn't work.\"\n\nThe flared top of Beijing's Citic Tower, the world's eighth-tallest skyscraper. Credit: Kohn Pedersen Fox\n\nWhat resulted was an exercise in compromise. Citic Tower's crown would become more curved and exaggerated at its corners, reflecting the flowing lines of traditional Chinese architecture. The showpiece skyscraper was completed last year, with state-owned conglomerate owner, Citic, set to move in this winter.\n\n\"We tried a bunch of schemes and ultimately got (city authorities) to understand -- or we convinced them -- that the subtle flare at the top mimicked the slope of a traditional roof, and that it was consistent with the tower's bottom,\" said Whitlock.\n\nBut, in retrospect, the timing of the request may have been no coincidence.\n\nLess than a year earlier, in 2014, President Xi Jinping had made a speech at a Beijing literary symposium in which, according to state media reports, he criticized the construction of unusual buildings -- presumably referring to the novelty towers, experimental shapes and unduly tall skyscrapers that had come to define contemporary Chinese architecture.\n\nVessel-shaped 'supertall' skyscraper transforms Beijing's skyline\n\nKPF's Li does not believe the request was a \"direct initiative\" from the president. Indeed, it would be another year before the State Council, China's cabinet, issued a more explicit 2016 directive calling for the end of \"oversized, xenocentric, weird\" buildings, in favor of those that are \"suitable, economic, green and pleasing to the eye.\" But the vice mayor's request seemingly reflected changing attitudes within Chinese officialdom.\n\nToday, in a country once seen as an architects' playground , there are growing signs that planners are no longer beholden to Western design. And architects -- whether influenced by Xi's position or the inspiration behind it -- are increasingly looking to the country's own history and culture for expressions of modernity.\n\nNew cultural confidence\n\nBefore the 2000s, contemporary Chinese architecture barely registered on the global radar.\n\nThe years following the 1949 communist revolution were characterized by a utilitarianism that considered the discipline a matter of engineering, not art. Communist China founder Mao Zedong's disdain for history also saw the widespread destruction of old structures, and only a last-minute intervention by his premier, Zhou Enlai, allegedly prevented him from tearing down the Forbidden City itself.\n\nIn the latter stages of the 20th century, few buildings of international interest or renown were ever realized on the mainland. One of the noteworthy exceptions, the late I. M. Pei's tranquil Fragrant Hills Hotel, fell into disrepair shortly after opening in 1982.\n\nBut a post-millennium construction boom changed all that.\n\nDevelopers had money to spend, and planners were eager to put their cities on the map with eye-catching landmarks. Foreign architects flooded into China, viewing the country as both a new source of revenue -- even more so after the 2008 global financial crisis -- and a loosely-regulated tabula rasa on which to test bold new ideas.\n\nOne of the more succesful examples of foreign-designed architecture in China, Zaha Hadid's Guangzhou Opera House won the best cultural building award at the 2011 RIBA International Awards. Credit: Image: Courtesy Zaha Hadid Architects Photo by Iwan Baan\n\nNotable successes emerged from the gold rush. Acclaimed British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid refined her space-age curves through the pebble-like Guangzhou Opera House and the uniquely textured Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre. In the capital, Dutch firm OMA's gravity-defying CCTV Headquarters (now known as China Media Group Headquarters) remains widely admired in architectural and engineering circles, despite its odd shape and subsequent local nickname \"da kucha,\" or \"big pants.\"\n\nYet, for every success, there were countless opportunities for ridicule: a coin-shaped office block in Guangzhou, an arts center in Zhengzhou resembling a collection of otherworldly eggs, and a gate-like Suzhou skyscraper whose likeness to a pair of pants was pointed out with far less affection. Local architects followed suit, with buildings resembling teapots musical instruments , a cellphone and even a giant crab\n\nThese bizarre forms make up just a fraction of the country's architectural output, according to Lu Andong, a professor at Nanjing University's School of Architecture and Urban Planning. But the media became attached to the \"weird China\" narrative -- so much so, that images of an unfinished tower went viral for its seemingly rude appearance, despite the final design being no more phallic than any of its neighbors.\n\nSuzhou's Gate to the East skyscraper pictured during construction in 2014. Credit: VCG/Getty Images\n\nThis unfortunate reputation will have factored into the government's new stance. But changes in China's architectural community were already underway, said Lu, who pinpointed 2008, the year Beijing hosted the Olympic games, as a more significant turning point.\n\n\"(Around this time), Chinese culture in general became more confident, because they were already at the world stage... they were a player, so they no longer looked to those leading (Western) architects,\" he said in a phone interview. \"They were quite confident in what they were doing.\n\n\"Around 2008 to 2010, there were more and more architects -- many of whom were educated overseas -- coming back to China. And they were familiar with how the international architecture sphere, or culture, operated... There was a change in the intellectual paradigm.\"\n\nEvolving identity\n\nThis period, and the years immediately after, saw Chinese architects making their mark globally. By 2012, Wang Shu had become the first mainland Chinese winner of the Pritzker Prize, the \"Nobel Prize\" of architecture. And Ma Yansong, founder of MAD Architects, began garnering international recognition -- and overseas commissions -- for his flowing, curvilinear buildings inspired by Chinese art. (More recently, Ma was chosen to design the long-awaited Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in L.A., arguably the most prominent US project by a Chinese architect to date).\n\nArchitect Ma Yansong on why curves matter\n\nWith a design philosophy drawn from traditional \"shanshui\" paintings (literally \"mountain and water\"), Ma represents, in many ways, the burgeoning cultural confidence that has seen architects look to the country's history, arts and geography for inspiration. Yet, as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late Zaha Hadid, he too may fall the wrong side of so-called \"xenocentrism.\" Indeed, his mountainous Chaoyang Park Plaza development, unveiled the year before Xi's 2014 speech, was marketed online as possibly being \"Beijing's last abnormally shaped landmark building to enter the market in the coming 10 years,\" according to the New York Times\n\nFor Lu, however, skyscrapers and landmarks are not the only barometers of the architectural atmosphere. The book he co-authored, \"China Homegrown: Chinese Experimental Architecture Reborn,\" offers examples of small-scale projects expressing national character through vernacular architecture -- the use of local materials, like bamboo, and region-specific construction methods or designs. Again, Lu said, the emergence of this movement predates the government directive.\n\nArhicetcture firm Archi-Union's \"In Bamboo\" cultural center in Sichuan province was constructed using local materials, building techniques and craftsmen. Credit: Photo by Bian Lin\n\n\"There was a kind of resistance to the 'international impact' of (foreign-designed buildings), and Chinese architects believed that there was something serious and more ontological within Chinese architecture,\" Lu said. \"Even in the early 2000s, they were confident about that.\n\n\"They were quite split. (There was) a group that was more internationally-oriented and wanted to be elevated into the international sphere, and wanted their projects to be covered by media and critics -- to be adored. On the other hand, there were architects who were quite unhappy about that, so they used regionalism to show another kind of identity.\"\n\nAforementioned Pritzker laureate Wang Shu, along with his wife and partner Lu Wenyu, continues to epitomize this nuanced approach to history. Take 2016's Fuyang Cultural Complex near his home city of Hangzhou, with its gently curved roof and irregular brick walls evoking the design of local village houses.\n\nA walk with Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu.\n\nPlenty of Chinese firms are taking similarly sensitive approaches to small-scale projects: Archi-Union's bamboo-woven cultural center in Sichuan province or WEI Architect's Fujian guesthouse , with its sweeping roofs that mimic the surrounding mountains.\n\nAnd overseas designers have shown increased cultural sensitivity in recent years, too, from David Chipperfield's understated ode to Zhejiang's red clay hills to WSP's irregularly stacked Hangzhou university complex, inspired by local courtyard homes.\n\nReinterpreting the past\n\nAlmost a decade after leading OMA's work on the CCTV Headquarters, German architect Ole Scheeren last year unveiled his latest Beijing landmark, the Guardian Art Center. Commissioned and approved before Xi's appeals, the auction house and exhibition space epitomizes Chinese architecture's new, almost Janus-faced identity.\n\nThe Guardian Art Center pays subtle tribute to Beijing's historic hutong architecture. Credit: B\u00fcro Ole Scheeren / Iwan Baan\n\nThe building's pixelated lower half plays with the geometries of the low-rise \"hutong\" alleyways beside it. The upper floors, meanwhile, pay tribute to the nearby houses, reimagining their brick walls as grids of rectangular glass panels. Scheeren even projected a 14th-century landscape painting, \"Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains,\" onto the building's facades, using the line of the mountains to inform an arrangement of small circular windows.\n\n\"We need to be truly contemporary and we need to be abstract, but we need to embed meaning in much more intellectual ways,\" he said of the project during a phone interview.\n\nHaving headquartered his firm, B\u00fcro Ole Scheeren, in China, the architect has observed significant changes since the heady early-2000s. He sees attempts by Chinese architecture to \"reclaim its own territory\" as a natural and \"very healthy process.\"\n\n\"China was simply going through a process of transformation, or at least I saw the beginnings of one,\" he said. \"After one or two decades of enormous enthusiasm and rapid growth, change and modernization, there was -- for the most part -- very little time left to reflect and think.\"\n\nScheeren identified a number of questions facing the industry generally -- but China specifically: \"How do you relate to the past without being sentimental about it? And how do you build a future and a present without forgetting what was there? I see no value in mimicking things from before.\"\n\nBeijing's historic \"hutong\" alleyways pictured from the Guardian Art Center. Credit: B\u00fcro Ole Scheeren\n\nThe architect highlighted the contrast between Guardian Art Center and its neighbor, a drab early-90s hotel topped with an incongruous temple-style roof that shows just how far notions of \"Chineseness\" have evolved. But this reflects not only progress in design thinking, but in attitudes among city planners and developers.\n\nThere are other, lesser-seen ways in which a shift in official attitudes may be transforming China's skylines.\n\nNanjing University's Lu said that foreign architects no longer have a guaranteed advantage in design competitions, which are often used to select major landmarks. Smaller cities may still hold reverence for Western designs, he admitted, but in places like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou or Shenzhen, local architects now have a \"fairer chance.\"\n\nKPF's Li, meanwhile, points to recent changes in how cities are designed at a macro level. \"I think what Mr. Xi is doing an amazing job at is getting the planning side to re-look at what is a livable city -- a better urban planning policy that will reduce pollution, traffic and look at satellite cities,\" he said, adding that China is looking to develop \"models more akin to northern European cities (with) livable, walkable, cyclable qualities.\"\n\nAccording to co-founder of Open Architecture, Li Hu (no relation), the Xi years have heralded stricter safety regulations and what he describes as a \"more democratic\" approval process. \"In the past, one top official could approve things on his own,\" he said in a phone interview, \"but now it has to go through lots of different departments and everyone gives their opinions.\"\n\nLi was unequivocal that the president's directive \"had no impact\" on his work, which he distanced from attempts to achieve notions of \"Chineseness\" -- though he still receives requests to do so.\n\nBuilt in renovated industrial oil tanks, Open Architecture's Tank Shanghai arts center is one of a growing number of renovation and restoration projects in China. Credit: Open Architecture / Wu Qingshan\n\nNonetheless, some of his firm's best-known projects, including Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in thoughtfully renovated industrial oil tanks, represent another movement in Chinese architecture: a greater appreciation for heritage. In a country where shiny newness once reigned large, and where historic buildings (including swathes of Beijing's historic hutongs) were regularly razed, there now appears to be more appetite for restoration projects.\n\n\"You're starting to see more and more reuse and renovation projects in many parts of China,\" Li said, \"particularly in big cities where they used to have a pretty strong (set) of industrial spaces.\"\n\n'Consciousness has shifted'\n\nWhile Open Architecture's Li doesn't credit this latter change to government policies, he accepts that the State Council directive -- initially, at least -- rattled developers and politicians who were afraid of inadvertently endorsing designs that would later become unpalatable to officials. \"For a while I heard rumors that many projects got put on hold, because people were unsure if they were 'weird' or not.\"\n\nYet, after this initial period of conservatism, the directive's influence has already \"faded away,\" Li said, citing the return of ill-considered buildings that he brands \"monsters.\" He recalls being told by a politician that one of his firm's recent competition entries was \"not crazy enough,\" which to him implied that unusual landmarks are \"still in people's minds.\"\n\n\"No one knows, exactly -- unless you're an insider -- under what context (the State Council's) statement was made. (It) was vague, so it was interpreted by different people in different ways,\" Li said, adding \"I've started to see a resurfacing of these irresponsible buildings again -- at a larger scale.\"\n\nGiven the opaqueness of China's government, it is near impossible to know how diktats filter down the political food chain. Moreover, large buildings can take years to complete (the aforementioned Citic Tower took eight), so any effects of the State Council's 2016 directive may be yet to transpire.\n\nFor three consecutive years, Shenzhen has built more skyscrapers than any other city in the world. Credit: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut despite optimism in some quarters about a new era of moderation, construction continues at breakneck speed. In 2018 alone, a total of 88 skyscrapers measuring 200 meters (656 feet) or above were completed in China , according to data published by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) -- the most skyscrapers built by a single country in a single year in history. A look at the hundreds more currently under construction reveals designs that might easily be described as weird, oversized or xenocentric. But there are plenty of low-risk, unimaginative boxes among them too.\n\nNonetheless, for Scheeren -- whose decade-long journey from the CCTV Headquarters to the Guardian Art Center seems to reflect the shift in Chinese architecture itself -- both extremes are being gradually eroded.\n\n\"There's much more caution about creating truly outlandish proposals, and also more caution to creating a total 'generic-ness.' Interestingly enough, Xi's position was not only focusing on one side,\" Scheeren said, offering his interpretation of the Chinese president's stance. \"He didn't only say 'let's not make such weird buildings anymore,' (but also how) everything has somewhat become the same across China's very big territory.\n\n\"And that was, maybe, the really important and intelligent aspect of the whole campaign.\n\n\"It's a process that is underway and maybe some (attempts) have been more successful than others,\" he added, referring to broader changes in architectural thinking. \"But I think the important thing is that the consciousness, generally, has shifted.\"\n\nBeijing's municipal government has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/chinese-architecture-xi-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2019-09-28T23:55:58+00:00"}, {"title": "Seoul's drag queens confront conservative attitudes", "text": "Written by Stella Ko, CNN Seoul, South Korea\n\nHurricane Kimchi takes the stage at an underground bar in Seoul, dancing agilely to Wonder Girls' 2008 K-pop hit \"Nobody.\"\n\nDressed in high heels, a fluffy white wig and a tight gold sequin dress -- an homage to the song's video -- he commands a fervent crowd that cheers, sings along and throws money at his feet.

Todd Henry, a professor of modern Korean history at the University of San Diego\n\nDrag may still be a fringe subculture in South Korea, but the scene appears to be growing. The first Seoul Drag Parade, held last year, attracted over 1,000 participants, far surpassing the initial estimate of 100 people, according to the parade's co-organizer Ali Zahoor. Participation in pride events is also expanding, said Eun-oh Yang of the Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center.\n\nover \"Compared to the past, drag culture exists in more diverse forms for both men and women, and now we have drag queens performing on stage at (the annual) Queer Culture Festival,\" she said, referring to Korea's largest LGBTQ festival, which attractedover 150,000 participants this year. \"I think it's being established as (part of) popular culture.\"\n\nDrag as a release\n\nLike drag queens around the world, Hurricane Kimchi uses performance to express himself and to break \"the stereotypes and get rid of toxic masculinity,\" he said.\n\nCo-organizer of the Seoul Drag Parade, Ali Zahoor, said there are also uniquely Korean reasons for the growth of Seoul's drag scene -- including the \"anxiety\" caused by the threat of war.\n\n\"North Korea's right there ... We are not scared, or we're not thinking about it too much, but it is in the back (of our minds),\" he said. \"Everyone's a little bit anxious all the time (and) I think that's where subcultures emerge.\"\n\n\"Korean society, as you can imagine, is crazy stressful,\" Zahoor added. \"Working hours are so long, kids have to study until really late at night and there's a need for an escape. (Drag) is a way of getting away from what you usually do, having fun and showing off what you are good at.\"\n\nGender-fluid drag queen and YouTuber, Serena 303 , uses K-pop and '70s fashion models as inspiration for her looks, which includes a transparent plastic dress paired with a pink visor. Her videos, in which she offers makeup tutorials and shares what it's like to be in drag, are designed to empower those still figuring out their identities.\n\n\"I want to tell them that it's OK to be who you are, and show them that someone like me can do drag,\" she said. \"The most important thing is that people are going to love you.\"\n\nFor Seoul-based \"drag king\" and English teacher, Jaxter the Taco Master, drag is both an anti-depressant and a play on gender. She is virtually unrecognizable on stage, with smoky eyes and her face entirely covered in gold glitter.\n\n\"Gender is a social construct (and) I can be both masculine and feminine whenever I want,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not just what other people want me to be.\"\n\n'Don't ask, don't tell'\n\nThere remains a pervasive \"don't ask, don't tell\" attitude towards gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ communities in South Korea. Hurricane Kimchi, who uses public transport to travel to his weekly show, said that no one dares look at him during the 30-minute journey.\n\n\"People might think and judge, but they wouldn't say anything out loud,\" he said. \"Even when I walk around with my drag makeup, people don't even look at you, they don't really do or say anything.\"\n\nHurricane Kimchi putting on makeup before a drag show at Alley Bunker in the Itaewon district of Seoul.

Homosexuality remains illegal in the military where it is punishable by up to two years in prison.In 2014, South Korea's National Institute of Korean language reverted its 2012 decision to make the word 'love' gender-neutral after complaints from religious groups. It now defines love as a feeling of affection \"between man and woman.\"\n\nWhether you are gay, lesbian or transgender, living as a sexual minority in Korea is very difficult. Eun-oh Yang, Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center\n\n\"(The) LGBT population will be labeled as going against the Bible (or) going against Confucian tradition and parental values,\" said Henry, the history professor. \"There are even arguments made that gay and lesbian (people) are pro-North Koreans, that they are kind of traitors to their nation.\"\n\nSerena 303 said she faced protests from conservative Christians during the Seoul pride parade last year. \"They would say 'You're gay, you're going to die,' and 'Think of your parents,'\" she recalled.\n\nAnti same-sex marriage activists attend a rally next to the Seoul Queer Culture Festival in June 2019.

Hurricane Kimchi said the arrival of Netflix in South Korea in 2016, which brought shows like \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" exposed many people to drag culture for the first time.\n\nThe internet is also taking drag culture out of the clubs and into the bedrooms of young South Koreans.\n\n\"Before the internet, the drag world would have been confined to the physical space of the club,\" Henry said. \"Now with the internet and Youtube, you can kind of fashion yourself and your style and persona, and you can communicate with other people virtually. That's a really interesting phenomenon.\"\n\nAnd it's having a wider impact on South Korea's LGBTQ community. Parades, events and shows all help to bring drag to a broader audience, Hurricane Kimchi said.\n\nParticipants attend the Seoul Queer Culture Festival on June 1, 2019.

According to Groves, communication between men is dictated by \"unspoken (style) judgments,\" but the historic narrative behind how men came to dress the way they do remains unexplored territory.\n\nRed Wool Greatcoat, by Nicholas Yip, 2017 Credit: Westminster Menswear Archive\n\nThe 170-piece show, which draws an alignment between uniform and fashion, is in part a showcase of the larger Westminster archive, as well as a smart retort to the dearth of menswear exhibits on the art and fashion calendar. \"At the recent Dior show [at the V&A museum],\" said Groves, \"there was no menswear. Nothing. The same at the McQueen.\"\n\nGroves took a prosaic approach when curating \"Invisible Men,\" by drawing on the seemingly invisible fashion of British men -- largely missing from museums -- and its roots in uniforms. For this exhibition, he chose to celebrate the style that begins on football terraces and in local pubs, the elements of which are passed down, from father to son, and then twisted to each new generation's tastes.\n\nA Manchester United fan wears a Daniel James shirt ahead of the Premier League match at Old Trafford, Manchester.

Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.\n\nTo many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.\n\n\"What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,\" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil's November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. \"This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.\"\n\nWhile the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had \"served as a learning opportunity.\" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n\nFormer Vogue Brazil fashion director Donata Meirelles in 2016. Credit: Fernanda Calfat/Getty Images South America/Getty Images\n\nAnd it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil's fashion community.\n\nAccording to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.\n\nHistorically, model diversity at S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.\n\nAt last edition of S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)\n\nWhy model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change\n\n\"In a country where most of the population is black, it's troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,\" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.\n\n\"The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it's important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,\" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.\n\nJuliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.\n\nIn early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire \"16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career.\" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.\n\n\"Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,\" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn't resonate with their audience.\n\nHe connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. \"We never talk about apartheid. We didn't have a Martin Luther King. We didn't have a Rosa Parks. We didn't have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don't talk about it either.\"\n\nIn this landscape, Brazil's black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.\n\nRio de Janeiro-based Luiza Brazil, an influencer and writer, has built her personal and professional brand online. Credit: Courtesy Luiza Brasil\n\nThis was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.\n\n\"We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,\" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. \"The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.\"\n\n\"I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it's always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.\"\n\nKevin David, a 25-year-old based in S\u00e3o Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he's used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi's, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.\n\n\"There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren't happy with the way the market was treating us,\" David said. \"We didn't want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.\"\n\nBrasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.\n\n\"We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general\", she said.\n\nTop image: Models backstage at the Apartamento 03 fashion show during Sao Paulo Fashion Week in April 2019.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/brazil-fashion-diversity/index.html", "published": "2019-07-02T11:48:26+00:00"}, {"title": "How did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes-Benzes?", "text": "Joshua Berlinger , CNN Written by\n\nOn June 14, 2018, two armored Mercedes-Maybach S600 Guard vehicles were shipped from the Dutch Port of Rotterdam, heading out on a journey that would take months and see the cars transported thousands of miles through six countries, according to a new report from the Washington-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS).\n\nAfter stops in China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, the two cars -- each worth about $500,000 -- are believed to have been flown to their final destination, Pyongyang. And in the North Korean capital, there's only one customer who likely requires this type of ride.\n\nThe origin and journey of the two Mercedes luxury vehicles were exposed in the C4ADS report. CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.\n\nSanctions passed by the United Nations as punishment for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development are supposed to bar companies and individuals from selling luxury goods to North Korea.\n\nThe exterior of a Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Guard. Credit: Daimler AG MediaPortal\n\nC4ADS found that North Korea imported at least $191 million worth of luxury goods from 2015 to 2017, sourced from \"as many as 90 countries\" in violation of United Nations sanctions. Definitive figures are difficult to determine because there isn't a shared definition of what constitutes a \"luxury item\" and due to the surreptitious way North Korea imports such items.\n\nThe Mercedes-Maybach S600, however, is undoubtedly luxurious. It's equipped with leather massaging seats and armor to protect occupants from steel-core ammo fired from assault rifles and from explosive devices, according to Car and Driver.\n\nKim is usually seen being chauffeured in what's believed to be a Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armored limousine, which carries a price tag upwards of $1 million. It's believed that was the vehicle his security escort ran alongside of during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.\n\nKim was also spotted with a Rolls-Royce last year\n\nDaimler, the company that owns Mercedes, told CNN it \"has no indication on how the mentioned vehicles were delivered and where they come from.\"\n\n\"Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes. To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process, which we consider appropriate and effective and which meets all requirements of the export control authorities,\" the company said in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility. We always investigate the vehicles displayed on the photos in the media thoroughly. However, without the vehicle identification numbers it is impossible to find a concrete trace.\"\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un steps out of a vehicle for a ceremony upon his departure from Russia, outside the railway station in the far-eastern Russian port city of Vladivostok on April 26.

Credit: Yuri Smityuk/TASS/Getty Images\n\nC4ADS concluded that North Korea maintains a complex, constantly evolving series of schemes in order to obtain luxury goods, like Kim's cars, to get around global export controls. The report concluded Pyongyang has imported 803 luxury vehicles from 2015 to 2017, with the majority originating from Russian companies.\n\n\"Not only are they continuing to use techniques that have been successful in disrupting traditional enforcement, but they're also sort of watching how we're tracking them and developing much more sophisticated techniques to continue to evade sanctions,\" said Jason Arterburn, a co-author of the C4ADS paper.\n\nLucas Kuo, another one of the report's co-authors, told CNN C4ADS' investigation aimed to \"evaluate what were the deficiencies within the international system that allowed this activity to continue?\"\n\nThe interior of a Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Guard.

They scoured customs records, shipping data, bills of lading and other open-source documents to trace how the vehicles made their way from Rotterdam to Pyongyang.\n\n\"We think we built a pretty compelling case to say that these Mercedes were likely bound for North Korea,\" he said.\n\nCNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.\n\nKuo and his co-authors concluded that the two Mercedes left Rotterdam for Dalian, then made their way on to Osaka, Japan, and Busan, South Korea. From South Korea, they were shipped out on a vessel called the DN5505, per the bill of lading.\n\nThat's when the journey gets murky. Shortly after the DN5505 left South Korea, it reported via its AIS system -- a way to locate ships at sea -- that its intended destination was the Russian city of Nakhodka, where it was estimated to arrive on October 5, according to C4ADS.\n\nThe rear exterior of a Mercedes-Maybach S 600 Guard. Credit: Daimler AG MediaPortal\n\nHowever, the ship's AIS data stopped pinging locations from October 1 to 19, according to the report.

On November 2, the vessel submitted a bill of lading to South Korean customs authorities that showed the ship was transporting anthracite coal allegedly from Nakhodka. But in Nakhodka, \"no record exists\" of the DN5505's arrival, C4ADS said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Port of Nakhodka authorities for comment on the report.\n\nA limousine belonging to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un drives away after a wreath-laying ceremony at a World War II memorial in the far-eastern Russian port of Vladivostok on April 26.

The pyramid-shaped, supertall skyscraper was to exceed 1,000 feet in height, and was designed to house at least 3,000 rooms, as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views.\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel -- named after a historical moniker for Pyongyang meaning \"capital of willows\" -- was supposed to open just two years later. But it never did.\n\nWhile the structure reached its planned height in 1992, it stood windowless and hollow for another 16 years, its naked concrete exposed, like a menacing monster overlooking the city. During that time the building, which dwarfs everything around it, earned itself the nickname \"Hotel of Doom.\"\n\nThe hotel has since been clad in metal and glass, and was later fitted with LED lights to turn it into a colorful nighttime spectacle. Construction work has started and stopped many times, fueling constant speculation over whether it will ever open to guests.\n\nStill closed to this day, the Ryugyong Hotel is the world's tallest unoccupied building.\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel in 2018. Credit: ED JONES/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA Cold War pawn\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel was a product of the Cold War rivalry between US-supported South Korea and the Soviet-backed North. The year before construction commenced, a South Korean firm had built what was then the world's tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford in Singapore. The South's capital Seoul was meanwhile getting ready to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, with the country transitioning to a capitalist democracy.\n\nAs part of North Korea's political response to the South's achievements, Pyongyang organized the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students, a sort of socialist version of the Olympics. The country planned to build the massive hotel just in time for the event, stealing the world record away from the South.\n\nBut due to engineering problems it wasn't finished in time for the festival. The government had already poured billions into the event, building a new stadium, expanding Pyongyang's airport and paving new roads. That put a strain on the hermit state's frail economy, while the Soviet Union's collapse left it deprived of vital aid and investment.\n\nNorth Korea was bound for an economic crisis. Although the external structure had been completed, construction was halted in 1992 and a crane was abandoned on top of the building.\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel in 2008. Credit: Eric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nA concrete structure\n\nThe building consists of three wings, each sloped at a 75-degree angle, converging into a cone encasing the top 15 floors, which are intended for restaurants and observation decks.\n\nThe pyramidal shape is about more than aesthetics -- it's because the Ryugyong, unusually for a skyscraper, is made of reinforced concrete rather than steel.\n\n\"It was built like this because the upper levels needed to be lighter,\" said Calvin Chua, a Singapore-based architect who has extensively researched Pyongyang's urbanism, in a phone interview. \"They didn't have advanced construction materials, so it was built entirely in concrete. You can't achieve a slender tower that way, you need to have a massive base with a tapered top.\n\n\"If you look at the history of construction in North Korea since the end of the Korean War, most of the buildings are made of concrete: That's the material that they are familiar with, and the technology transfer between Soviet or communist states is purely based around concrete.\"\n\nMembers of a Socialist Women's Union propaganda troupe perform a dance in front of the Ryugyong hotel in 2019. Credit: ED JONES/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccording to Chua, who has worked in North Korea with local architects, the Ryugyong may have been designed to look like a mountain, not a pyramid, because mountains play an important role in the country's symbolism. The official biography of Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of current ruler Kim Jong Un, states that he was born in a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, the tallest mountain in the Korean peninsula that is depicted in the national emblem of North Korea. (Many historians believe Kim Jong Il was actually born in Russia.)\n\n\"It's a very iconic building, but I think it's important to consider where it sits in relation to the entire city fabric of Pyongyang,\" said Chua. \"It's like a sort of obelisk. If you think of the obelisk in Rome's St. Peter's Square, it provides a [beacon] for the city apart from its symbolism. The Ryugyong is similar, but it's also more symbolically defined.\"\n\nA second start\n\nIn 2008, after a 16-year pause, construction unexpectedly resumed, as part of a deal with Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build North Korea's 3G network.\n\nThe rusty old crane that had stood atop the building for two decades was finally removed . Workers aided by Egyptian engineers installed glass and metal panels to the concrete structure at the cost of $180 million, glazing it completely and giving the building a polished, sleek appearance. The project, completed in 2011, fueled speculation about the hotel's opening. In late 2012, German luxury hotel group Kempinski announced that the Ryugyong would partially open under its management in mid-2013, but then pulled out a few months later, stating that entering the market was \"not currently possible.\"\n\nThe cladding of the concrete shell. Credit: Eric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nLong-standing rumors that the building was structurally unsound due to poor construction techniques and materials gained strength once again. In 2014, a 23-story apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang because construction was \"not done properly,\" according to North Korean state media reports.\n\n\"Judging from the exterior, the building looks structurally sound, although the interior may be a different story,\" said Chua. \"I think the real problem might be the ease of fitting it out, because it was built with concrete and it would take a lot of time to rewire the necessary services and ventilation systems that were originally created to 1980s specifications. That would be much easier with a steel structure.\"\n\nPhotographs of the hotel's interior from 2012 revealed that, inside, very little work had been done. The images were taken by Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Group, a Beijing-based company specializing in North Korea tours, and one of the very few foreigners to have been inside the Ryugyong Hotel.\n\nThe lobby of the Ryugyong Hotel in 2012. Credit: Simon Cockerell / Koryo Group\n\n\"It was arranged through a Korean connection as a birthday gift for me,\" he said in a phone interview. \"First of all, we had a presentation from the director of the site, with videos made quite a long time ago. Then they took us into the lobby area, where there was a lot of exposed cement. Then we went (on) the one working elevator to the top, which was the 99th floor, I believe.\n\n\"It took a long time to get there, because it was a service elevator, not a modern lift with a string of buttons. There was a lift operator who determined where to stop. At the top we had a look around, took some pictures and went back down to the lobby again.\"\n\nAlthough its external appearance had been transformed, the Ryugyong still wasn't open.\n\nA brighter future?\n\nThe Ryugyong came back to life in 2018, when LEDs were installed on its facade, turning the building into Pyonyang's biggest light show -- as well as a propaganda machine. A four-minute program shows North Korea's history and a variety of political slogans, while the cone at the top projects a huge North Korean flag.\n\n\"It's really striking the first time you see it, especially after so many years of the building sitting there in darkness,\" said Will Ripley, a CNN correspondent who has taken multiple trips to Pyongyang, in an email. \"I know they turn it on whenever there are major events in the city, but it's not on all the time -- I would assume to save scarce electricity.\"\n\nThe light show in 2018. Credit: ED JONES/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, extensive work has been carried out on the site surrounding the hotel, which was recently opened up, making it possible for anyone to walk right up to the front entrance (but not get in). In June 2018, a sign was added to the building, reading simply \"The Ryugyong Hotel\" in Korean and English.\n\nThe question remains: Will it ever open? \"It's very hard to say, because since the building was clad in glass, you can't see inside,\" said Cockerell. \"No doubt something's going on. It's a very large building. It's not inconceivable that some part of it may open before the whole of it could open. If it was my building, I'd focus on the top and the bottom.\"\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel is no longer the tallest building in the Korean peninsula: The Lotte World Tower in Seoul, completed in 2017, surpassed it by nearly 800 feet (240 meters). It is still the tallest in North Korea, although Pyongyang has seen a growth spurt of high-rise residential towers recently, with the tallest being just 197 feet (60 meters) shorter than the Ryugyong.\n\nRelated video on North Korea: Creating the fantasy of prosperity through design\n\nFor years, to avoid embarrassment, the North Korean government has airbrushed the building from official pictures of Pyongyang. But the installation of the LED lighting may signal that there's a plan for its future.\n\n\"I think the North Korean government would definitely like to do something with it,\" said Ripley. \"For years, it was an embarrassing eyesore -- especially before the glass exterior was installed. I imagine if they do finish it, and Kim Jong Un makes an inspection and it's all over the state media, it will be more widely acknowledged as a proud centerpiece of the city.\n\n\"Personally, I think it would be fascinating to see what they do with the inside and go all the way to the top. I'm sure the views are extraordinary.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ryugyong-hotel-architecture-origins/index.html", "published": "2019-08-10T00:27:22+00:00"}, {"title": "The man on the phone: What's it like making history's highest auction bid?", "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nIn November 2017 at Christie's New York, Alex Rotter uttered a phrase never before heard at an art auction: \"Four hundred million.\"\n\nHis bid was in dollars, and the lot in question was the last known Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands. Audible gasps gave way to applause, and, less than a minute later, the gavel fell to make history.\n\nAfter fees, the \"Salvator Mundi\" sold for $450.3 million , obliterating auction records for a work of art.\n\nBut it wasn't Rotter who made the world-famous purchase -- it was the anonymous bidder on the end of his telephone line. In fact, he was just as surprised as anyone.\n\n\"I thought when we reached $200 million it would end,\" he recalled to CNN on the phone. \"Then I thought it would end when we reached $300 million... a natural stopping point.\"\n\n\"It was really unclear how far the client would go. It was just (me saying), 'Do you want to?' I remember making sure that I -- that he -- was very clear about the bidding increments and what the next bid was.\n\nRotter (far right) during the sale of the \"Salvator Mundi\" at Christie's New York. Credit: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty\n\n\"Normally I'd just say the next bid, but I remember clarifying it at 300 million. I said, 'It's $300 million, do you want to bid $300 million now?'\n\n\"At this level you can't mess up -- you can't (get it) wrong,\" he added.\n\nIt's a remarkably candid account, given how tight-lipped Christie's has remained about the historic sale. The auction house has consistently refused to discuss the bidder's identity, though it is widely believed to have been Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, acting on behalf of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, better known as MbS.\n\nThe moment Leonardo da Vinci's \"Salvator Mundi\" sold for $450 million.\n\n\"I had no recollection of time -- you could have told me it was two minutes,\" Rotter said of the 18-minute bidding war, adding: \"(It) was one of the most exciting moments that I've experienced in my 20 years of auctions.\"\n\nArt world matchmaker\n\nAustrian-born Rotter, Christie's chairman of post-war and contemporary art, wouldn't be drawn on further details. But his recollections of other record-breaking sales paint a compelling picture of high drama and pressured decision-making.\n\nHis auction day role -- which the 45-year-old admits is \"quite stressful\" -- sees him telling telephone bidders what's happening in the room. This means relaying the auctioneer's words and price increments in real-time, as well as communicating details about potential rivals (revealing the identity of other phone bidders is, however, \"a big no-no,\" Rotter stressed).\n\nAgents celebrate after the auction of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Salvator Mundi\" during the Post-War and Contemporary Art evening sale at Christie's on November 15, 2017. Rotter is pictured on the right. Credit: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty\n\nMany of Rotter's interlocutors are long-term clients. So he's also on hand to offer advice -- how much similar artworks sold for, or how a bidding war might unfold. And then, by Rotter's own admission, there's an element of gentle encouragement. Auctioneering is a commissions business, after all (and the so-called \"buyer's premium\" at Christie's ranges from about 13% to 30% of the winning bid).\n\nWhat might surprise those outside the art world, however, is that his wealthy clients don't always have a maximum price in mind -- even when it comes to multimillion-dollar paintings.\n\n\"I've heard people on the telephone say, 'Alex, let's just buy it, no matter how far it goes,' and I've heard people (say), 'I have a limit, and don't even ask me if we reach (it) because I don't want to be tempted,'\" revealed Rotter.\n\n\"People have different strategies for how to go about it. I do think people get carried away.\n\n\"Competition attracts everyone, and on auction night, you're in the bidding process and it's a little bit of a race. People don't like to lose.\"\n\nIn recent years, Rotter has become a familiar sight in the so-called \"phone bank,\" the line of well-heeled go-betweens covering their mouths as they confer with anonymous buyers. Last November, he made another world record bid -- this time on behalf of an unidentified client pursuing David Hockney's \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures).\" At $90.3 million, the sale marked the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living artist.\n\n\"Rabbit,\" by Jeff Koons, is now the most expensive artwork by a living artist to ever sell at auction. Credit: Courtesy Christie's\n\nThis record was broken again, just six months later, by Jeff Koons' $91.1-million \"Rabbit\" sculpture. And although Rotter wasn't on the winning client's side this time, he was nonetheless instrumental in bringing the artwork to auction.\n\nIndeed, despite his public-facing role, most of the Austrian's work happens in the weeks and months prior to a sale. As well as conceiving of auction themes and populating them with relevant works, he serves as something of an art-world matchmaker, filling gaps in collectors' portfolios and tracking down the world's most sought-after paintings.\n\n'Dream of big numbers'\n\nIdentifying targets means knowing art intimately -- and seeing lots of it too. The journey to bring Koons' \"Rabbit\" to auction began with Rotter's personal encounter with the sculpture at the Newhouse Apartment gallery in New York at the beginning of the last decade: \"I remember saying to my colleagues, 'one day...'\" he recalled.\n\nEven at the highest echelons of the art market, such instincts outweigh number-crunching. Data \"substantiates the intuition and gut feeling experts have,\" Rotter said.\n\nHailing from a family of Austrian art dealers, these instincts are, undoubtedly, finely tuned. He made his first sale, aged 13, at his mother's booth at a Vienna art and antiques fair, where he sold an early 19th-century porcelain cup and saucer for the equivalent of $1,000, and a watercolor by Austrian painter Rudolf von Alt for 10 times that.\n\nAlex Rotter moved to Christie's from rival auction house, Sotheby's, in 2016. Credit: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty\n\n\"My mother had to help in the final round of negotiation as I didn't want to give more than a 10% discount and the guy insisted on more,\" he recalled. \"But I remember the feeling of closing a sale and it had me hooked.\"\n\nThirty years on, closing deals is still the endgame. When desired artworks are identified, it's often Rotter's job to convince their owners to part company with them. Such discussions involve not only an item's valuation, but negotiations over fees and the size of the opening bid (\"In an ideal world, you start lower than you think it would make, and then have it run\").\n\nFor the aforementioned Hockney painting, whose owner Christie's courted for a year and a half, it was a case of making them \"dream of big numbers,\" as Rotter recalled.\n\n\"People who own $80 million paintings are (going) to be savvy and smart. They didn't just sign on the dotted line. They made it competitive. So, after us, they also went to the other auction houses and asked them for opinions, values, pitches.\n\n\"There was some price resistance,\" he added, \"Hockney's world record (at the time) was $25 million, and here was a painting that was expected to sell for $80 million.\"\n\nDavid Hockney's \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures).\" Credit: Courtesy Christie's\n\nBut while Rotter estimates that bidding usually starts between 30% and 50% of the expected price, the Hockney auction opened low, at just $20 million -- a quarter of Christie's top estimate. The gamble paid off, as bids soared past $90 million.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we got our result by starting low and tempting (bidders) ... so it worked out beautifully.\"\n\nMarket pressures\n\nWith collectors increasingly shopping for art on Instagram and looking beyond Western marketplaces for returns, there are plenty of challenges facing European auction houses.\n\nIn July, research firm ArtTactic reported that Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips had posted a collective 20.3% year-on-year drop in sales in the first half of 2019. Indeed, if it weren't for the $450 million auction of the \"Salvator Mundi\" in 2017, and Peggy and David Rockefeller's huge $832 million private art collection in 2018, then both of these years might have been considered disappointing for Christie's, too.\n\nThis recent dip may not concern an auction market known for its volatility. For all the ups and downs of the last decade, global auction sales in 2018 were, at $29.1 billion, slightly above 2008 levels, according to Art Basel and UBS' authoritative Global Art Market Report\n\nBut sales of art and antiques online -- whether from auction houses' websites or internet retailers -- have exploded, almost doubling between 2013 and 2018. Online transactions may represent a small chunk of the art market, at $6 billion, but growth looks set to continue. Generation Z collectors are more than twice as likely than their millennial or generation X counterparts to prefer buying art on the internet, the same report found.\n\nRelated video: Former Christie's CEO Steven Murphy explains how art auctions work\n\nWith their wood-paneled rooms, corded telephones and paper catalogs, the old auction houses of New York and London appear increasingly antiquated. Nonetheless, Christie's is adapting to the digital age -- more than 250 years after its founding. Last year, it hosted 88 web-only auctions, and generated online sales of $250 million (up by more than 16% from 2016, the year Rotter arrived from arch rival Sotheby's).\n\nIt's still a brick-and-mortar business. But Rotter is confident that his employer -- now owned by French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault -- can use heritage to its advantage.\n\n\"There is obviously something very traditional, something charming about (auctions) -- that it's still wooden benches (and) telephones,\" he said. \"There's obviously a digital technology revolution going on in the auction business. A lot of the transactions happen online now. (But) the spectacle of the evening sale stays the same.\n\n\"People like to dress up; they like to come to the auction or to participate in it somehow,\" he added. \"It's serious art we're selling, but it's still an event.\"\n\nMoreover, he depicts big-ticket auctions as being uniquely democratic -- great levelers through which an artwork's market value emerges in real-time. Or as Rotter put it: \"Who bids the most gets the painting. There's no trickery, there's no advantage for someone who comes first or has a bigger name. That's the beauty of it.\"\n\nThe phone bank, pictured during the sale of David Hockney's \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures).\" Credit: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty\n\nWhen it comes to the art itself, however, bigger names command bigger prices. So which painting is the holy grail of the market -- the one artwork his clients all want but can't have?\n\n\"There are a handful of objects,\" Rotter said. \"I'm not talking about pieces that are hanging in MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum, because they will never be obtainable. But there is (always) one object that still sits in a private collection -- this one Van Gogh, this one Warhol, this one Koons -- that everyone wants.\n\n\"Obviously, I have this list in my office. It lives there -- I know it by heart -- with little thumbnail images.\n\n\"You always try,\" he concluded, adding: \"Always shoot for the masterpieces.\"\n\nTop image caption: Rotter (right) confers with a telephone bidder.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/alex-rotter-christies-auction/index.html", "published": "2019-08-17T00:45:54+00:00"}, {"title": "Giorgetto Giugiaro, the 20th century's most influential car designer", "text": "Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\n\nFew other designers have been as influential as Giorgetto Giugiaro in shaping modern automobiles. In a career spanning 64 years he has designed some of the most successful and influential cars in history, ranging from one-of-a-kind exotics to mass market utility vehicles.\n\nHe's designed over 200 cars for manufacturers around the world which collectively put over 60 million cars on the road and -- at the age of 81 -- is still working today. Having sold his design practice Italdesign in 2015, he continues to design, now with his son Fabrizio, under the roof of a new firm called GFG Style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 17 \u2013 Alfa Romeo Iguana (1969) Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro has created some of the most successful and influential cars in history, in an impressive career that spans over six decades.

Credit: Shutterstock\n\nBirth of a legend\n\nBorn in 1938 in Garessio, about 60 miles South of Turn, Giugiaro came into the world at the prime time and place for a young boy who would eventually become a gifted designer. Fiat, Italy's flagship automaker, was an hour's drive away and the country's post-war economic boom would coincide with Giugiaro's coming of age. In fact, Giugiaro joined FIAT as early as he possibly could -- when he was just 17 -- but not because he was eager to draw cars.\n\n\"I got involved with cars not out of passion, but as a part of my creative process,\" he said in a phone interview from his studio in Moncalieri, just outside Turin.\n\nThe Giugiaros were a family of artists and Giorgetto was supposed to pursue a similar path. His father, however, noticed that he had a more technical inclination, and so allowed him to go to art school by day and study technical design in the evenings.\n\nDante Giacosa, FIAT's technical director, saw some of his car sketches and hired him as a junior designer. \"I joined FIAT in 1955 to have an experience outside of the arts world, not really knowing where it would lead to. This experience was more valuable than a school and gave me confidence to experiment with my creativity.\"\n\nAfter four formative years at Fiat, Giugiaro's work was noticed by Nuccio Bertone, who ran one of several influential coachbuilding ateliers that had sprung up around Turin at the time, including Ghia, Pininfarina and Vignale. Bertone's firm made its name by styling beautiful cars for other manufacturers, and put Giugiaro at work on some forward-thinking projects.\n\n\"In 1960 I saw my first prototypes come to life at Bertone: The Gordon-Keeble GT, the Alfa Romeo 2600 and the Giulia GT, which I finished as I was drafted for the then obligatory military service. I was 22.\"\n\nA classic Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GT, produced from 1963 and one of Giugiaro's first designs at Bertone, in a race in Bologna in 2017. Credit: NurPhoto/NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAfter creating cars at Bertone under badges such as BMW, Mazda and Ferrari, Giugiaro switched jobs again in 1965, joining Bertone's competitor Ghia. There, he designed two of his most beautiful cars, the Maserati Ghibli and the De Tomaso Mangusta.\n\nA Maserati Ghibli and, in red, a De Tomaso Mangusta. Credit: Giorgetto Giugiaro\n\nThe Mangusta went on to become a minor icon among sports car enthusiasts, although only around 400 were produced. Its passenger doors open normally, the design features gullwing doors for the engine and luggage compartment, a truly unique styling quirk. It's Bill's car in \"Kill Bill: Volume 2,\" it features in the film \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" and in Kylie Minogue's \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" music video.\n\nThe Italdesign era\n\nIn 1967 , aged 29 but with 12 years of work experience, Giugiaro started his own design firm, Italdesign, and moved heavily into mass produced cars, shaping some of the world's most successful people movers. As a designer, this is the type of work he preferred. \"The mass-produced car, as a project, has many variables, including timing, costs, feasibility, directors, marketing -- the creative aspect isn't hard, but the mediation between all these variables is. That makes it more gratifying,\" he said.\n\n\"The hedonistic car, the car that everybody wants but nearly nobody can have, is a lot easier do to, because it's created for publicity, it doesn't have to rely on a complex structure.\"\n\nIn 1974 he was asked to design the successor of the Beetle for Volkswagen. The resulting first generation Golf -- known as the Rabbit in the US -- debuted Giugiaro's \"origami period,\" a new styling sensibility dominated by sharp, angular lines. It would influence car design for generations, and create one of the most resounding success stories in the automotive world: The Golf, currently in its seventh generation, is still the undisputed leader in its sector, with sales to date in excess of 30 million units.\n\nGiugiaro with the Golf Mk1 in 1974. Credit: Giorgetto Giugiaro\n\nDespite his growing fame, Giugiaro kept a low profile. \"When Volkswagen asked me if I wanted to have a badge on every Golf they built that read 'design by Giugiaro,' I said 'No, thanks.' It would have cost me more to send them thousands of badges every day than the money I got from the entire project! When people buy a car, they don't generally care about who designed it. Cars are not artworks. Art is prestigious, but cars are not.\"\n\nMovie icons\n\nGiugiaro applied his sharp-edged, origami style to cars that were meant for wildly different purposes and markets.\n\nIn 1976 he designed the Esprit for English automaker Lotus, which became James Bond's car in the following year's \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" famously transforming into a submarine. The very car that was used for the film's underwater scenes was purchased by Elon Musk in 2013 for nearly $1 million.\n\nThe Lotus Esprit from \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" also known as \"Wet Nellie.\" Credit: LEON NEAL/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShortly after, Giugiaro styled the DeLorean, a 2-door coupe launched in 1981 that was consigned to immortality when Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale picked it as Marty McFly's car for \"Back to the Future\" in 1985. Giugiaro based the DeLorean on the Tapiro, a 1970 concept car he had created for Porsche. It was similarly wedge-shaped and, most importantly, sported a stainless steel body with gullwing doors.\n\n\"I didn't expect that it could be picked as a movie car,\" he said. \"Its unpainted look is due to the fact that DeLorean didn't want to spend anything on painting equipment, so he went with stainless steel, but that didn't come without problems. I'm glad when someone remembers that I designed it.\"\n\nPetersen Automotive Museum/Ted 7\n\nAround the same time, during a fruitful collaboration with Fiat, he designed the two affordable and compact cars of the 1980s for the Italian automaker: the well-known Uno and the Panda.\n\nWith its brutally basic design, Giugiaro's Panda was the opposite of a bedroom poster car in its heyday, but it's now attracting a cult following, the \"4x4\" version especially. In a 1980 interview to Italian newspaper La Stampa, Giugiaro described the Panda as \"a pair of jeans: a simple, practical, no-frills piece of clothing.\" He likened the design to that of a military helicopter: \"a light, rational machine designed for a specific purpose.\"\n\nThe Fiat Panda. Credit: Giugiaro\n\nMore than cars\n\nGiugiaro's designs extend beyond the automotive industry thanks to an industrial design division of Italdesign, launched in 1974. Since then he's designed the Nikon F5 camera trains for the Riyadh metro, a professional coffee machine , a dentist chair, several Beretta guns, sewing machines, watches, tractors, motorbikes and the stadium for Turin's football team Juventus FC, and perhaps the most unexpected -- a pasta shape called Marille.\n\nGiugiaro with a Nikon camera he designed. Credit: Giorgetto Giugiaro\n\n\"These were a great way to fill the dead times between car projects -- but the creative process and technique are exactly the same as a car, there's no difference. It's more liberating, because it lets me escape the normative hell of cars, which are full of rules and regulations,\" said Giugiaro.\n\nToday, Giugiaro is no longer involved with Italdesign, after Volkswagen -- through its subsidiary Audi -- first acquired 90% of its shares in 2010 , then the remaining 10% in 2015 . But he's still designing cars: One of his latest creations, presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2018 in celebration of his 80th birthday, is an electric concept named Sybilla (after his mother, Maria Sibilla).\n\nGiugiaro with the Sybilla concept. Credit: Giorgetto Giugiaro\n\nWhenever he sees one of his own creations on the road, he has a simple thought: \"I notice what I could have done better. I'm always thinking about the future, about doing what I couldn't have done before. So, in a way, I'm constantly working even when I'm not working.\"\n\nThere is, however, something he would have liked to design but never got the chance to: \"I love the design of modern fighter jets and even space ships that you see in the movies. I would have enjoyed designing a plane.\"\n\nIt's never too late, mister Giugiaro.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/giorgetto-giugiaro-interview/index.html", "published": "2019-08-23T08:54:22+00:00"}, {"title": "Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem", "text": "Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN\n\nLast month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide \"momentum\" for its \"existing diversity and inclusion approach.\"\n\nThe move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.\n\nAbout two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to \"create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity.\" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.\n\nThese announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.\n\nFashion brand Burberry apologized for showcasing a hoodie that featured a noose around the neck during its show at London Fashion Week. Credit: REX/Shutterstock\n\nThese missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.\n\nHiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.\n\nTeen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , \"why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?\"\n\nAnother user wrote: \"white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.\"\n\nIn a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment \"is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.\"\n\nThe brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.\n\nFrom the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?\n\nFashion's new watchdogs\n\nWith designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.\n\nFashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.\n\nTake the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million \"Dieters\") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.\n\nSocial media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.\n\nBut controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.\n\nThe industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, \"and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown\" in marketing materials. \"It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.\"\n\nMeanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw \"coolie\" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's \"New Look\" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.\n\nA model wears the popular bar suit by Christian Dior. The press dubbed Dior's first collection, \"New Look.\" Credit: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images\n\nSales of the YSL perfume \"Opium\" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.\n\n\"We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,\" Steele said in a phone interview. \"How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.\"\n\nWhile the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.\n\n\"The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,\" Steele added. \"Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.\"\n\nWhy brands miss the mark\n\nWhether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.\n\nThis is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.\n\nHere, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as \"creepy\" by social media users.\n\nFashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.\n\nThis raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.\n\nA Dolce & Gabbana ad sparked controversy after it depicted an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks. Credit: Dolce & Gabbana\n\nFormer Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like Chlo\u00e9, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.\n\nShe believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.\n\n\"These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.\n\n\"With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,\" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. \"Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.\"\n\nTapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the Herm\u00e8s-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.\n\nMore than money\n\nThere is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.\n\nThe D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.\n\nDolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China\n\nIf more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. \"Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,\" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and \"in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.\"\n\n\"You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,\" she said. \"You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.\"\n\nSteele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.\n\nGucci came under fire for retailing a $790 turban, a garment with religious significance for Sikhs. Credit: FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.\n\n\"Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,\" said Steele.\n\n\"On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.\"\n\nThis pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.\n\n\"Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,\" she said in a phone interview. \"In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.\"\n\nSteps toward accountability\n\nBrands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.\n\nIn January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.\n\n\"The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,\" the briefing stated. \"It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.\"\n\nAs the report articulated, diversity is \"simply a measure of difference\" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating \"a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole.\" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.\n\nPrada came under fire for producing merchandise resembling blackface caricatures. Credit: Courtesy Chinyere Ezie\n\nThe current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.\n\nThe industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.\n\nRemedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.\n\nWhile no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will \"elevate voices of color.\"\n\nAnd when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund \"to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)\n\nBurberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.\n\nBut they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.\n\nAt the time of publication, D&G, Dior and Saint Laurent had not responded to CNN's request for comment.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-gaffes-industry-diversity-problem/index.html", "published": "2019-08-03T02:55:42+00:00"}, {"title": "Battle of Supremes: How 'legal fakes' are challenging a $1B brand", "text": "\n\n\n\nVideo by John General, CNN Jacopo Prisco , CNNVideo by John General, CNN Written by\n\nWhen Samsung revealed , in late 2018, that it was collaborating with cult US streetwear brand Supreme, it came as quite the surprise.\n\nThe announcement was made during the launch of Samsung's Galaxy A8s smartphone in Beijing, where logos of the Korean tech giant and the New York skate brand unexpectedly shared a huge screen. Two men, introduced as Supreme executives, unveiled ambitious plans for their company in China, including an inaugural event at Shanghai's Mercedes-Benz Arena and a seven-story flagship store in the capital. Headlines soon followed.\n\nBut there was a problem: It wasn't Supreme. Not the New York-based one, at least.\n\nIt was, instead, an entity known as Supreme Italia. With roots in Italy, the label is run through a limited company in the UK and has opened four physical stores in Spain.\n\nSupreme New York quickly denounced the brand as a \"counterfeit organization.\" Samsung initially stuck to its guns, however. In a since-deleted post on Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo, the tech firm said it always knew it was working with Supreme Italia, which, it said, was the legitimate owner of the Supreme trademark in China.\n\nShortly after, Samsung said it was reconsidering the collaboration and eventually canceled it entirely. But Supreme Italia, which denies being a counterfeit operation, was already planning to expand into China and beyond.\n\nThis fashion giant is under siege by imitators. Here's why it's legal\n\nBirth of a cult brand\n\nSupreme started as a humble Lower Manhattan skate store, opened by British-American entrepreneur James Jebbia in 1994. It has since grown into one of the most sought-after brands in fashion, boasting collaborations with the likes of Louis Vuitton , Lacoste, Nike and Timberland. The label is valued at more than $1 billion, after private equity firm The Carlyle Group acquired a 50% stake for $500 million in 2017.\n\nA Louis Vuitton trunk with the Supreme logo. Credit: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nJebbia has rewritten the rules for streetwear brands in the process, building Supreme's fame through social media hype and scarcity. Its clothes can only be bought online or through a network of just 11 stores worldwide: one each in LA, Paris and London, two in New York and six in Japan.\n\nIt was in Japan that Supreme perfected a sales tactic known as the \"drop\" -- releasing a limited quantity of new clothes on a weekly basis, rather than an entire new collection every season. The strategy, now widely replicated by traditional fashion brands, prompted long lines at Supreme's stores and fueled online resale marketplaces where prices skyrocketed.\n\n\"Over time, it really became a huge frenzy,\" said David Fischer, founder of streetwear and lifestyle website Highsnobiety. \"It became a huge event, where Supreme fans from around the world would line up in front of Supreme stores to get a hold of the latest product ... It's not only about standing in line to buy a new product. It's just as much about being there with a community that you're a part of.\"\n\nSupreme's most valuable asset is arguably its simple logo, a red rectangle marked with the word \"Supreme,\" which fashion platform Lyst crowned the industry's most powerful logo in 2018. It can turn almost anything into a collector's item. Supreme's latest collection includes a branded water gun, a coffee maker, a drum kit, a snorkeling mask and even Band-Aids. When the New York Post ran a Supreme cover ad in August 2018, newsstands sold out of the paper by early morning; Supreme New York MetroCards from 2017 are currently listed on eBay for $500. But there are weaknesses in Supreme's all-powerful logo and brand that Supreme Italia has used to its advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 9 The Spring-Summer 19 collection from Supreme New York includes many off-kilter collector's items, such as Band-Aids. Credit: Supremenewyork.com\n\nA difficult one to trademark\n\nThe color and typeface of Supreme's logo -- red, with white lettering in a font called Futura Heavy Oblique -- is precisely the same combination used by conceptual artist Barbara Kruger since the 1980s.\n\nThe Supreme logo had been hastily designed to stamp on T-shirts when the first store opened in 1994, and it was, by the company's own admission , directly influenced by Kruger's work. Three years later, the brand even reproduced Kruger's 1987 \"Untitled (I shop therefore I am)\" work -- a consumerist take on Descartes' 17th century maxim, \"I think therefore I am\" -- on a T-shirt , substituting the titular phrase with the word \"Supreme.\"\n\nShannon Finney/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, the company has a long history toying with other brands' designs without permission. Almost two decades before its 2017 collaboration with Louis Vuitton, Supreme received a cease-and-desist letter from the French fashion house for using its iconic monogram print on a series of products, including skateboards, which were then recalled\n\nBut the label has now itself become the target of imitation. In 2009, Jebbia told Interview magazine that \"Supreme wasn't meant to be a brand ... It's a good name, but it's a difficult one to trademark.\"\n\nChapter 4, the company that does business as Supreme, did not obtain a successful registration of its trademark in the US until 2012. Nearly a year later, the firm filed a $10 million trademark lawsuit against streetwear brand Married to the Mob, after it used a parody \"Supreme Bitch\" logo on some of its products. The parties settled out of court.\n\nKruger, however, has never sued Supreme (\"I don't own a font,\" she told The Cut in 2017). But the irony that her anti-consumerist art is being used to sell clothing is not lost on her. In 2017, the artist staged a live performance called \"Untitled (The Drop)\" which featured a shop full of Supreme-esque merchandise branded with phrases like \"Don't be a jerk\" and \"Want it. Buy it. Forget it.\"\n\nA Supreme by any other name\n\nIn 2017, the company was busy defending itself from more than just mockery. Supreme is now one of the most counterfeited brands in the world and its fakes are among the most searched for\n\nThe case of Supreme Italia, however, is more complex, with the brand often referred to as what trademark lawyers call a \"legal fake.\"\n\n\"It's a practice that involves registering a trademark in a certain country before the original owner of that trademark has a chance to do so,\" explained Alessandro Balduzzi, a trademark lawyer at Studio Legale Costa Creta - Bugnion in Italy.\n\nGiovanni Casucci, a lawyer for Chapter 4 who's litigating the ongoing case in Italy, questions the very premise of the term: \"I find it very funny because it's an oxymoron, a completely self-contradictory definition. You can not be legal if you're fake,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\nCasucci instead draws a parallel between Supreme Italia's actions and cybersquatting, the practice of registering domain names similar or identical to popular brand names, with the intent of later selling them at a profit. \"It's a phenomenon that was highly criticized 20 years ago and now it's clearly an evident abuse,\" he said.\n\nSupreme Italia claims to have started out in 2012, but it first made its mark on social media in 2016 during Pitti Uomo, an international menswear fair held in Florence, Italy. Images from the event showed the brand's hoodies and T-shirts bearing large versions of the famous red logo.\n\nChapter 4 took notice. In 2017, it sued Supreme Italia, or, more precisely, the two companies behind it: an Italian company that produced and sold the clothes online and in shops under license, and a UK private limited company called International Brand Firm (IBF), which had registered and licensed the trademark in Italy and other countries. IBF is essentially the business behind the Supreme Italia brand and its ramifications.\n\nThe high court in Milan ruled in Chapter 4's favor twice, in January and April 2017, issuing an injunction that made Supreme Italia's operations in Italy effectively illegal. A definitive ruling could take years to emerge, however. Supreme Italia's lawyers have already appealed once (and lost) and they plan to appeal again. Simona Lavagnini, a lawyer at LGV Avvocati in Milan who's litigating the case in Italy for IBF, told CNN the case could ultimately reach the country's Supreme Court.\n\nTo be effective, a so-called \"legal fake\" must register a trademark before the original brand does. But IBF did not file for a trademark with Italian authorities until Nov. 18, 2015, more than a month after Chapter 4. This is one of the reasons why the court sided with the original Supreme.\n\n\"Another reason was unfair competition,\" said Balduzzi, \"Because not only was (Supreme Italia) producing clothing using a trademark that they did not own, but they were also acting on the market as if they were the legitimate owners of the brand.\"\n\nDespite this, Lavagnini maintains that Supreme Italia is \"not a copy,\" claiming that when IBF filed its trademark, Chapter 4's existing registration did not yet appear in online searches. She also believes that the word \"Supreme\" is too generic to be trademarked in the first place. \"Our claim is that Supreme is a word (typically) used to refer to the quality of a product, like 'super,' extra,' or 'extraordinary,'\" she said in a phone interview. \"'Super' is actually the root of supreme, and is considered by Italian case law to be a classic case of descriptive trademark, which cannot be registered but must be free for all competitors on the market.\"\n\nHowever, these claims were rejected by the Milan court. The judges ruled that Chapter 4's Supreme brand was sufficiently well-known in Italy to acquire a \"secondary meaning\" and be considered a de facto trademark, even in the absence of advertising or physical stores.\n\nBetter luck in Spain\n\nA similar legal case has also occurred in October 2018 in Spain, where IBF registered another trademark: Supreme Spain. But here, things unfolded quite differently . A court in Barcelona ruled in favor of IBF, because, in this instance, it had registered its trademark before Chapter 4.\n\nChapter 4 used the \"secondary meaning\" argument that had proven successful in Italy, but in Spain it didn't work. As trademark lawyer Balduzzi explained: \"The burden of proof can be very high and it is difficult to overcome.\" The decision has since been appealed, and another ruling is expected in the next two months, according to Casucci.\n\nAs a result, Supreme Spain continues to operate its own website , which sells around 100 items of clothing, as well as accessories, and offers shipping to around 40 European countries. Perhaps more notably, it also owns four physical stores , in Madrid, Barcelona, Ibiza and Palma de Mallorca. The logo is different -- black text on yellow, with the word \"Spain\" at the bottom -- but the clothes still feature the classic red box design, among other familiar variations.\n\n\"The fact is, there is no distribution of the physical products in Italy or Spain,\" argued IBF attorney Lavagnini referring to Supreme New York products. \"There are a few shops in some privileged European countries like the UK and France, then there is a website where it is theoretically possible to acquire the products, but they immediately sell out ... And then the only way to buy the product is to go to these resellers websites where the products are sold at much higher prices.\" IBF's official Instagram account claims \"We are against the illegal and immoral practice of reselling.\"\n\nChapter 4's attorney Casucci dismisses this as \"the frivolous argument of a free rider. They are not Robin Hood.\" He acknowledges that the Supreme Spain operation is legitimate, but adds \"my impression is there's a typical case of undue profit off the reputation of another brand.\"\n\nIBF has scooped Supreme trademarks in a number of other territories. Listings on trademark website TMView show that the company has filed registrations in 67 countries, mostly in Europe and Africa, as well as China. IBF is \"working with the Supreme trademark in nearly 90 countries,\" the company's PR representative Anna Boccoli told CNN.\n\nCasucci believes that IBF's approach is in bad faith and in violation of the Paris Convention, one of the first intellectual property treaties ever signed, which protects \"well-known marks\" in 177 countries even in the absence of local presence.\n\nA shopper wears a Supreme/Louis Vuitton hoodie outside a Louis Vuitton store in Miami. Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nA search on the World Intellectual Property Organization's website returns 28 entries filed by IBF that relate to the word Supreme. They include variations such as Supreme Sailing, Supreme Underwear, Supreme Toyschool, Supreme Home, Supreme Sport, Supreme Optical Wear and Supreme Skate Snow Wear.\n\nAccording to Casucci, this volume of registrations could have cost \"dozens if not hundreds of thousands of euros\" and can only have been motivated by \"an expectation to steal some markets or at least to enter in a parallel way in those markets.\"\n\nThe man behind Supreme Italia\n\nThe man behind Supreme Italia, IBF director Michele Di Pierro, declined CNN's request for interview. He is, according to his PR representative Anna Boccoli, a private man who avoids the spotlight.\n\nIn a phone interview, Boccoli said that Di Pierro -- whom she claims to have known for many years -- is the talk of Barletta, his home town in southern Italy, due to the fact that his brand is \"worth what it's worth internationally.\" According to publicly available filings , IBF reported sales of around \u00a3514,000 ($682,000) in 2017, up from \u00a3173,000 ($230,000) the year before.\n\nBoccoli described Di Pierro as \"an energetic man who follows his instinct,\" adding that he frequently travels to China. He also produces clothes for other fashion brands, which Boccoli said he \"has regularly acquired.\" Among these she says are Airwalk, VisionStreetWear and Pan Am, which were presented at Pitti Uomo in early 2019.\n\nThe idea for Supreme Italia came about in 2012 and began with a batch of test T-shirts, according to Boccoli. The plan was \"spontaneous,\" she said, and Di Pierro \"did not want to make an Italian copy, but rather his own project.\" Prior to the Milan court ruling, Supreme Italia distributed its products to 1,000 stores in Italy, although it had none of its own, Boccoli said.\n\nOn the expansion into China, Boccoli said that IBF's local distributor, which brokered the canceled Samsung deal directly, plans to open 60 stores in the country over the next two years. In fact, it opened an IBF-licensed Supreme store in Shanghai in early March, she confirmed, with a second one opening soon. In a written statement sent to CNN after our phone interview, Casucci said \"Chapter 4/Supreme has taken action in China against the counterfeit organization IBF/Supreme Italia and their Chinese partners and landlords with regards to their store opening. IBF impersonates Supreme, sells counterfeit goods and misleads law enforcement, reporters, and even companies like Samsung who have not undertaken full diligence on this counterfeit operation.\"\n\nBoccoli also claimed that more IBF-licensed stores will be opening in countries worldwide, beginning with Serbia, Belarus, Cyprus, Portugal and the Gulf states.\n\nHow do the clothes compare?\n\nTo compare IBF's creations with those of the original Supreme, CNN recently ordered three items from Supreme Spain: a black hoodie with a large printed red box logo, a \"SupremeKids\" T-shirt featuring what appeared to be Mickey Mouse's ears and hands, and a men's T-shirt with an embroidered logo.\n\nThe two orders -- which were shipped from Italy and Spain -- were delivered to London via courier within a few days. They did not include any printed invoice or return label. There are differences between these garments and the originals, according to Yuri Mishka, a moderator of one of Italy's main Facebook reselling communities (which is affiliated with neither Supreme New York nor Supreme Italia). The black hoodie's logo is much larger than that of the classic Supreme item it resembles, and is printed rather than embroidered. Conversely, the men's T-shirt, has an embroidered logo rather than the original's printed one. The \"SupremeKids\" T-shirt appears to reference a 2009 collaboration between Supreme and Disney, although with a significantly altered design that does not show Mickey Mouse in his entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 CNN purchased this Supreme Spain hoodie online in mid-February 2019. Credit: Sarah Tilotta\n\nLuigi Goglia, another lawyer for IBF, said that Supreme Spain's business \"is not just legitimate, but more than legitimate\" pointing out that the design of the clothes \"is totally different, it's another concept of fashion.\"\n\nThe care labels all claim that the items are made in Italy, and all bear a yellow \"Supreme Spain\" logo alongside references to IBF's trademark registrations, a hologram with a serial number and the flags of 50 countries, including territories where IBF has registered Supreme trademarks. IBF confirmed that Supreme Spain manufactures clothing in Italy and accessories in China, whereas original Supreme products are manufactured primarily in the US and Canada.\n\nThe prices also differ. An original Supreme logo hoodie retails for $148 but can fetch upwards of $450 on the resale market, according to Mishka, while the Supreme Spain one cost 71.20 euros (about $80).\n\nLeft: a Supreme New York hoodie from online reseller StockX. Right: a hoodie for sale on Supreme Spain's website. Credit: StockX/Supreme Spain/John General\n\nA loss in Europe\n\nCiting its trademark registrations in Italy and Spain, IBF has claimed another victory against Chapter 4: In April 2018, the European Union Intellectual Property Office opposed Chapter 4's application for a trademark in Europe from a year earlier. Chapter 4 has since appealed and a decision is still under examination.\n\nIf the decision is overturned, Supreme's trademark registration would cover the whole European Union, saving the company time and effort to apply separately in each country. But despite what will likely be a heated battle, Casucci does not believe that IBF has significantly impacted Chapter 4's business as of yet.\n\n\"It's not a threat, frankly speaking, at all ... It's just really an annoying thing, something that cannot be tolerated, because in some markets, the less informed ones, there's a risk that some consumer will be misled into buying this product thinking it's the original.\n\n\"And that is a fraud -- against the consumer, not against Supreme and Chapter 4.\"\n\nSamsung did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/supreme-italia-legal-fake/index.html", "published": "2019-03-18T14:41:55+00:00"}, {"title": "Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak", "text": "Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.\n\nA humongous pink gemstone perches on a woman's finger, matched only in extravagance by her hair, which is half the height of her body.

Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, better known as Zunar, has spent most of the last decade lampooning Najib and Rosmah, even as the risks for doing so grow ever greater.\n\nZunar's work welcomes visitors to \"Democracy in Action,\" a recent exhibition that would have been impossible to stage only a year ago. In one cartoon, a hand holding chopsticks marked \"China\" reaches over to pluck Malaysia off a platter marked \"1MDB scandal.\" In another, a huge diamond ring, a handbag and a bag of cash come together, Transformers-style, to form an image of Rosmah.\n\nAt the center sits Zunar's motto: \"How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 Zunar has faced considerable restrictions on his work in the past. Credit: Zunar\n\nThat motto has been severely tested in recent times. Just last year, it seemed almost certain that Zunar would end up in prison. A number of his books had been banned, and while his work was still widely shared online, the artist faced multiple charges of sedition and committing acts deemed \"detrimental to parliamentary democracy.\" Unknown assailants attacked him at a gallery show, police seized his works and he was banned from leaving the country.\n\nThen, in a shock election result, a coalition of opposition parties turfed Najib out of office, promising to clamp down on corruption and reverse the country's turn toward authoritarianism.\n\nNow Zunar is watching as his the political figures who were once his nemeses and muses face decades behind bars themselves -- in part because artists like him helped bring attention to their alleged corruption and disdain for the rule of law.\n\nZunar tells CNN that it's his mission to save Malaysia. Credit: James Griffiths/CNN\n\n\"The medium of cartooning is (a) very powerful medium,\" Zunar told CNN at his small studio in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. \"Everywhere, in any country you go, (cartoonists) get killed. Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.\"\n\nFellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.\n\n\"Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\n\"People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That's where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.\"\n\nCartoonist's muse\n\nAfter a number of false starts, Zunar's career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.\n\nAccording to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib's wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar\n\nIn many ways, the artist's career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.\n\nAs Najib's star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar's increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.\n\nMore even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.\n\nRosmah Mansor, the wife of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, arrives at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in Putrajaya on September 26, 2018. Credit: -/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"When my book came out with Najib on the cover, I could at least release it,\" Zunar said. When Rosmah was the subject however, \"the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple's properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of Herm\u00e8s handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.\n\nMany of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah's spending -- became a central theme of Zunar's work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste.\n\nOne of Zunar's cartoons show Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste. Credit: Zunar\n\n\"Zunar has such a finely developed sense of what is right and what is fair,\" said Robert Russell, executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International. \"Like any good political cartoonist he has this well-developed sense of righteous indignation.\"\n\nRussell said Zunar's cartoons were so effective, in part, because they undercut concerted efforts by the government to present itself, particularly overseas, as a legitimate and clean administration. Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.\n\nBut doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib's government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.\n\nClowning around\n\nBeginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.\n\nIn 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed \"detrimental to parliamentary democracy\" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.\n\nA collection of Zunar's books seen on sale in a Kuala Lumpur shopping mall in February 2019. In the past, multiple of the cartoonist's books were banned, and copies seized by the police. Credit: James Griffiths/CNN\n\nLater that year, Zunar was slapped with a travel ban after he visited Geneva to accept the Cartooning for Peace Award. The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, \"appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.\"\n\nZunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.\n\nFahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows. The image quickly caught on with Malaysians sick of the widespread allegations of corruption, and it soon became a common sight at anti-government protests.\n\nA caricature of Malaysian Prime Minister by artist Fahmi Reza. The artwork almost landed Fahmi in prison. Credit: MOHD RASFAN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLike Zunar, Fahmi had a record of trouble with the authorities. In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Fahmi's conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners. He was quickly arrested.\n\n\"I panicked and I was afraid,\" Fahmi told CNN. \"But I think surviving that made me bolder, knowing that the poster I made was having an effect on these people who abused their power.\"\n\nMalaysian cartoonist Zulkifli Anwar Ulhaque, popularly known as Zunar, poses with handcuffs prior to a book-launch event in Kuala Lumpur on February 14, 2015. Credit: MANAN VATSYAYANA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen he was arrested again in 2016, Fahmi was \"fully prepared,\" he said.\n\n\"One sign that whatever you're doing is effective is when the authorities and people in power react,\" he added. \"If they ignore it, then there's no impact. That's how the whole clown thing became a symbol of protest -- because of the overreaction by the authorities.\"\n\nSatire as a weapon\n\nBoth cartoonists' arrests made international headlines, helping to highlight Najib's growing authoritarianism to the outside world. Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.\n\nAs Malaysia's opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016's general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.\n\nActivists hold up caricatures of Najib Razak and Rosmah Mansor (center). Political art became a key tool of protest in Malaysia during Najib's rule. Credit: MOHD RASFAN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn early 2018, it introduced a new law to crack down on \"fake news\" that critics said was so broadly defined that it could easily be used to shut down and criminalize criticism of Najib.\n\nEventually however, the wave of dissent was too great for Najib to overcome. Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.\n\nUncertain future\n\nSince Najib's downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.\n\nBoth men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.\n\nZunar has faced considerable restrictions on his work in the past, struggling against Malaysia's laws on speech and expression. Credit: Zunar\n\n\"(The government is) more tolerant toward online dissent and criticism -- and even insults,\" Fahmi said, despite the fact that the \"online content\" law used to prosecute him is still on the books.\n\n\"People know it's still there, so I think some people are still afraid to voice their criticism openly,\" Fahmi said.\n\nZunar said the new government's most important task is to \"repair the damage\" done by previous regimes. He is willing to give them time to do so, but as for the future, \"we don't know yet.\"\n\nRussell, of Cartoonists Rights Network International, said Zunar faces a situation similar to that of other dissident cartoonists when their former oppressors leave office.\n\nIn the last year of Najib's rule, Zunar was banned from leaving the country. Credit: Zunar\n\n\"Even with Zunar's heroes ... now in a new government, he's going to start drawing the same cartoons about them,\" he said. \"This is not necessarily a happy ending. If Zunar is true to his roots, he will be as ruthless with the new government as any (other) government.\n\nIn the short term, Zunar is facing a more pressing concern: the loss of his muse, Rosmah.\n\nWhile she has largely disappeared from Malaysia's political scene while her husband attempts to reinvent himself as a man-of-the-people government critic, the former prime minister's wife remains present inside Zunar's studio, her cartoon face staring up from numerous books and picture frames.\n\n\"I miss Rosmah,\" the artist said. \"For me, she was a god send.

But a growing number of lingerie brands are responding to discontent from consumers who want to see themselves better represented.\n\nFrom offering a wider range of cup sizes and \"nude\" shades, to celebrating diversity in campaigns and on runways, intimate apparel labels are selling more than bras. They're selling inclusivity, too.\n\nLingerie is set to become a $59 billion market globally by 2024, up from $38 billion in 2017, according to Zion Market Research. And as sales grow, tastes also appear to be shifting.\n\nSales figures published by retail technology firm, Edited, suggest that bralettes and sports bras are increasingly preferred to cleavage-enhancing push-up bras. Victoria's Secret may still lead the pack with a reported 24% market share in the US, but it recently announced plans to shutter more than 50 stores following slow holiday season sales.\n\nBrands like ThirdLove are catering to an increasingly diverse customer base. Credit: Courtesy Third Love\n\nThe closures come amid growing competition from newer brands, many of which are catering to broader tastes. Customers are embracing lingerie that encompasses alternative forms of sex appeal, and increasingly buying from brands that prioritize body positivity, comfort and proper fit.\n\nSizing up\n\nIndependent labels, like US startup ThirdLove, have filled a gap in the market by serving women who struggle to find bras in the right size. When Heidi Zak co-founded the brand in 2011, she simply wanted to provide bras that fit better than those at her previous go-to store, Victoria's Secret.\n\nUsing 600 million data points across metrics including breast shape and cup fit, ThirdLove promotes half-cup sizes. Today, the online-only brand offers 78 different sizes -- and is worth an estimated $750 million, according to Forbes\n\nThe unseen history of underwear\n\nBut offering more sizes can be an expensive endeavor. The inflexibility of factory production makes it difficult to cater to everyone, according to Cora Harrington, author of the book \"In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie.\"\n\n\"There are so many parts to a bra, sizes and variations to breasts, that it's impossible for any one brand to service every single bra-wearing customer adequately,\" she said in a phone interview.\n\nAccording to Harrington, who also founded the Lingerie Addict blog, a single bra can contain at least 20 individual components, including lace, closures and straps. For a luxury garment, this number can swell to 40 or 50, she said.\n\nAdd the precision sewing and pattern-making required to adjust for different sizes, then piece everything together, and it can create a product that costs more than \"what people feel is appropriate to pay for a bra.\"\n\n\"(To) serve an adequate range of people,\" Harrington added, \"you're looking at 50 to 60 sizes to start, which is far beyond what most indie designers or new brands are able to afford.\n\n\"Consumer expectations are a little bit misaligned with product design and development ... people are used to fast-fashion cycles (and seeing) something on a runway, then seeing a knock-off two weeks later.\"\n\nRihanna's Savage X Fenty label has been celebrated for its wide range of sizes and \"nude\" tones, as well as its use of diverse runway models. Credit: Brian Ach/Getty Images North America/Getty Images for Savage X Fenty\n\nSome lingerie makers have nonetheless found ways to profitably expand their size ranges, contributing to what Harrington calls a \"bra size war.\" Rihanna's Savage X Fenty, for instance, produces lingerie for plus-size body types (up to 3X and 44DDD) in addition to straight sizes, with other labels going up to 46H or higher.\n\nDiverse customers\n\nThe growing lingerie market is providing greater choice to another group of customers it has traditionally underserved: transgender shoppers.\n\nMontreal-based Origami Customs offers gender-affirming lingerie to transgender customers, among others. With trans visibility at an all-time high, the brand has doubled sales over the last four years, according to founder Rae Hill.\n\nThe label has recently expanded its line of binders, an undergarment used to flatten the chest, that it models on transmasculine customers. Gaffs, a type of underwear used for tucking, make up nearly half of the products that Origami Customs sells.\n\n\"I've felt an outpouring of gratitude from my customers (especially trans women) about the affirming process of working with me,\" Hill said in an email interview.\n\nMontreal-based Origami Customs offers gender-affirming lingerie to transgender customers, among others. Credit: Courtesy of Origami Customs and Rae Hill\n\n\"I take the time to work with each customer one-on-one, and I do feel that this creates a level of safety and intimacy that isn't available in the mainstream market.\"\n\n\"Being sexy is as different as each one of us,\" Hill added.\n\nRacial diversity is also a growing force in the lingerie market. Take Rihanna's aforementioned label, which has been praised for producing a variety of \"nude\" tones for different skin colors. Similarly, ThirdLove's recent line of T-shirt bras offers nine shades of \"naked.\"\n\nBefore either of them, London-based disruptor Nubian Skin became one of the first brands to offer nude tones for women of color when it launched in 2014.\n\n\"We saw a lot of brands debut their own nude tones in the years immediately after the launch of Nubian Skin,\" Harrington said. \"Some of those brands have since rolled back (their selection) because they didn't market them very well -- if you're going to sell nude tone bras in deeper skin tones, it would help to use models of color.\n\n\"I hope that, for these companies (new brands like ThirdLove and Savage X) it's not a trend (but) something they plan to stick with.\"\n\nA matter of representation\n\nInclusivity isn't just about selling lingerie to diverse customers -- it's about doing so visibly. This means using models of all shapes, sizes and colors in fashion shows and campaigns.\n\nTake Lonely Lingerie, for instance, which claims to portray women in a realistic way by refusing to use Photoshop -- or even hair and makeup stylists -- in its campaigns. The brand's models include women with 35 different bra sizes and from a variety of backgrounds.\n\nNew Zealand-based Lonely Lingerie says it doesn't use Photoshop or hair and makeup stylists. Credit: Courtesy Lonely Lingerie\n\nFounder Helene Morris said that, when she started the label in 2009, \"there was no one in the lingerie world who was speaking in a way we related to at all.\" Her brand's \"Lonely Girls\" project featured senior models, breastfeeding mothers, pregnant women and disabled women, all photographed in natural light.\n\n\"We really wanted to give the power ... to the person being shot -- how they want to be shot, how are they most comfortable and involving the woman in that process,\" Morris said in a phone interview.\n\nPlus-size label Curvy Couture also sees the use of diverse models as an important step towards inclusivity, according to social media marketing manager, Summer Rose.\n\nCurvy Couture is \"designed, owned and operated by curvy women, for curvy women,\" said the company's social media marketing manager. Credit: Courtesy Curvy Couture\n\n\"We have a ton of fit models that come in -- different sizes, different ages, moms who are post-breastfeeding -- just so we can really make sure that the fit is supportive,\" she said in a phone interview. \"No matter what stage in life she is in, we want to make sure she feels her best.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/lingerie-designers-inclusivity/index.html", "published": "2019-03-13T04:13:14+00:00"}, {"title": "How India's political parties get their symbols", "text": "Written by Manveena Suri, CNN Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nA ceiling fan, a bungalow, a broom and a mango -- these are just some of unusual symbols Indian voters can expect to see on their ballots as they head to the polls over the coming weeks.\n\nAn array of minimalist -- and often hand-drawn -- logos feature alongside candidates' names on electronic voting machines across India during its general election, the world's largest democratic exercise.

Richards/Getty Images\n\nIn adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.\n\nBeyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.\n\nThere is her favorite \"majority\" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her \"dissenting\" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in \"Ruth\") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).\n\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's \"majority\" collar. Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWhen espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.\n\nWhen worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.\n\nBut those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not \"wear\" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least\"straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as \"mind\" or \"spirit,\" while women represent the baser realms of \"body\" and \"flesh.\"\n\nRe-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes\n\nTo clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.\n\nThis risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.\n\nGinsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of \"body\" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy , Justice John Paul Stevens, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia , Justice David H. Souter, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Samuel Alito. Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nTo re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most \"noticeable\" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).\n\nGinsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.\n\nAnd finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.\n\nUS President Barack Obama is greeted by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Obama arrives to deliver his State of the Union address on January 12, 2016.

Moviegoers can pose for selfies in \"RBG drag,\" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: \"Imagine yourself here! This could be you!\"\n\nOf course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct when Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ruth-bader-ginsburg-collars/index.html", "published": "2018-08-20T11:22:54+00:00"}, {"title": "Jiakun Architects design Serpentine Pavilion in Beijing", "text": "Written by Aric Chen\n\nAric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.\n\nUpon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.\n\nAs a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.\n\nAn early rendering of the Serpentine Pavilion Beijing, designed by Jiakun Architects. The pavilion is a stone's throw from the Forbidden City. Credit: Jiakun Architects\n\nWe should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum\n\nBut mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as \"low-tech,\" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.\n\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The temporary pavilion will be open to the public from May 30 to October 31, 2018. Credit: WF Central\n\n\"His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,\" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.\n\nLiu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural \"realism.\" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.\n\nCentered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.\n\nBut as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them \" Rebirth Bricks \") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.\n\nShifting attitudes\n\nA stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.\n\nEven the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.\n\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of \"junzi,\" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow. Credit: Jiakun Architects\n\nOften small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.\n\n\"He's the right architect at the right time,\" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.\n\nAccording to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of \"junzi,\" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.\n\n\"I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,\" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. \"It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.\"\n\nPut another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).\n\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. Liu Jiakun's style is often described as a form of architectural \"realism.\" Credit: WF Central\n\nNonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.\n\nThe country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/serpentine-pavilion-beijing-jiakun-architects/index.html", "published": "2018-05-30T04:56:01+00:00"}, {"title": "Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West", "text": "Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish\n\nIn a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.\n\nThe pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.\n\nCecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.\n\nMansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.\n\n\"Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'\" Cecioni said in his studio. \"They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'\"\n\nWith over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.\n\nThe best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.\n\nCecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.\n\nCecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. \"Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,\" he said. \"They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.\"\n\nHow Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: \"There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,\" he said.\n\nSanctions taking effect\n\nBeyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.\n\nThe sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.\n\nCecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.\n\n\"This money is highly significant,\" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. \"We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.\"\n\nCecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.\n\n\"It's like a big art company, there are many branches,\" he said. \"The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).\"\n\nCecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.\n\nDespite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.\n\n\"The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,\" he said. \"I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.\"\n\nCecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. \"The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,\" he said.\n\nBest-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.\n\nBut while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.\n\nBut instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.\n\n\"We are not really trying to sell anymore,\" he said, \"because we cannot replenish our inventory.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/north-korea-art-dealer-pier-luigi-cecioni/index.html", "published": "2018-05-07T02:30:19+00:00"}, {"title": "David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist", "text": "David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.\n\nThe \"English Angelino,\" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.\n\nWe are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.\n\nDavid Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist\n\nThe studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.\n\nWe hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.\n\nI'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).\n\n\u201c I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. \u201d David Hockney\n\nMaking polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.\n\nHockney quickly interjects: \"Yes, they are just big voids,\" he says, referring to the TV screens. \"I don't like voids.\"\n\nPainting the pool\n\nHockney says that his swimming pool was also looking \"a bit like a void,\" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.\n\n\"Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,\" he says. The job took him two and half hours, \"and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.\"\n\nHockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. \"Of course, I thought I could do it,\" he says a little defiantly.\n\nHe admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's \"a bit too pale\" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- \"Gregory wouldn't like it.\"\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" (1972) by David Hockney Credit: Art Gallery of New South Wales/Jenni Carter\n\nA bigger retrospective\n\nThe pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\n\"I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,\" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.\n\nI ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). \"Well,\" comes the blunt reply, \"it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.\"\n\nWe both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy\" (1970-1971) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\n\n\u201c I think in painting you can do things you can't do in photography. Edvard Munch said photography can't compete with painting because it can't deal with heaven or hell. \u201d David Hockney\n\n\"Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy\" (1968) by David Hockney Credit: Tate, David Lambert and Rod Tidnam\n\nThroughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- \"Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.\"\n\nHis father had been \"a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,\" he says with a certain relish.\n\nFish and chips\n\nHaving first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.\n\nHe has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.\n\n\"Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).\"\n\nHockney has astonishing recall. There were only \"about five copies,\" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under \u00a319,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.\n\n\"My Parents\" (1977) by David Hockney Credit: Met\n\nOne of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid \u00a35 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. \"That was quite a lot of money then,\" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.\n\nHockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.\n\nA gay pioneer\n\nHockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, \"Adhesiveness,\" for less than $60.\n\n\"I remember delivering it to his house,\" he tells me. \"He had it for 40 years.\" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.\n\nWe sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures \"look rather good and stand up,\" he says.\n\n\"Man in Shower in Beverly Hills\" (1964) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\n\n\"Domestic Scene Los Angeles\" (1963) by David Hockney Credit: Private collection\n\n'I feel 30 in the studio'\n\nIt's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.\n\nHockney likes to paint in silence, \"to look, and look again.\" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was \"amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.\"\n\nHockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.\n\nHanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.\n\nThe image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.\n\nEvery day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. \"I'm perfectly happy doing this,\" he says. \"I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.\"\n\nArtist David Hockney in his Bayswater studio Credit: Francis Goodman/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nDavid Hockney's eyes are matched for color during a sitting for his waxwork for Madame Tussaud's Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know \"what to do straight away\" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.\n\nOur interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.\n\nHe doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.\n\n\"Travelling, I feel 80,\" he says poignantly.\n\nA bigger book\n\nFor almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: \"Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.\"\n\nA crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of \"A Bigger Book,\" a 77-pound \"sumo\" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.\n\n\"Well, I realized,\" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, \"that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?\"\n\n\"A Bigger Splash\" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\n\nHis own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. \"I keep looking through it,' he admits.\n\n\"I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,\" he muses. \"Every day I've done what I want to do.\"\n\n\"That's a privilege', I say. \"I know I'm privileged,\" comes the reply, \"I've always known that I was privileged.\"\n\nHanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: \"Thank you for brightening our world.\"\n\n\"That was OK, wasn't it?\" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. \"Yes,\" I exclaim, \"more than OK. Thank you!\" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.\n\nOn camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- \"with love, David and a kiss\" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.\n\nCNN's Francesca Church, Oliver Dann, Ana Rosado, Emir Eralp, Aaron Darveniza and Fiona Sinclair Scott contributed to this story.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/david-hockney-at-80-interview-los-angeles/index.html", "published": "2018-02-07T08:43:02+00:00"}, {"title": "Roger DaSilva's forgotten photos show glamour of 1950s Senegal", "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nA wedding party crams into a small car.

While DaSilva was primarily a portrait photographer, he also spent time documenting street scenes and weddings, among much else.\n\nThe restored photos were all taken in the decade before -- and years immediately after -- April 1960, when Senegal secured independence from France in one of the more peaceful and politically stable transitions from colonial rule.\n\nA band plays in 1952.

The photographer operated among Senegal's burgeoning high society, and the restored archive includes an image of the country's first post-independence president, Leopold Senghor, and a shot of DaSilva shaking hands with jazz legend Velma Middleton.\n\nRoger DaSilva with jazz legend Velma Middleton.

Born in Benin, he served in the French army, where he photographed injured soldiers, burn victims and concentration camp survivors.\n\nFollowing World War II, he settled in Dakar and later set up a studio in the city. DaSilva's son Luc, a curator, recalled its lively atmosphere.\n\n\"His studio was a place of gaiety for those who came to be immortalized in front of his camera. Affable, with a lot of humor and relaxing words to put everyone at ease, it was nice to be there,\" he said in an email interview, later adding: \"He was often surrounded by all sorts of artist friends and other intellectuals.\"\n\nA car parked up outside Roger DaSilva's studio in Dakar.

Luc has helped to preserve and promote his father's -- and Africa's -- photographic heritage through his organization Xaritufoto.\n\n\"One thing is certain: He was very present in the life of Dakar, going from one community to another frequenting all layers of the population, always being well accepted,\" Luc said of his father. \"And he knew the world.

To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.\n\nLittle did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.\n\nIt was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nThe original version of Tetris.\n\nTetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called \"tetrominoes\" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nTo simplify things, he knocked that down to four squaares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral \"tetra\" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.\n\nPajitnov himself was immediately hooked. \"I couldn't stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,\" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.\n\nTetris was inspired by pentomino, a classic board game. Credit: Shutterstock\n\nBut creating a video game in Soviet Russia at the height of the Cold War was far from easy. It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nWord of mouth\n\nAlthough Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than today's calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. \"It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,\" said Pajitnov.\n\nPajitnov wasn't making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.\n\nThen, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.\n\n\"My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,\" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.\n\nStein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.\n\nEventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nPajitnov and his son with the UK and US PC versions of Tetris in 1989. Credit: Wojtek Laski/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe Game Boy\n\nTetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.\n\n\"I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,\" said Rogers in a phone interview. \"He said, 'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.' And I said, 'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.'\"\n\nRogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. \"So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,\" he said.\n\nOnce in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.\n\n\"She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. They're not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasn't supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,\" he said.\n\nBut among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. \"Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,\" Rogers recalled. \"I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.\"\n\nHenk Rogers and Alexey Pajitnov in Moscow's Red Square.\n\nThe Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra \"easy to learn, hard to master.\"\n\nDelayed royalties\n\nDespite the game's success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. \"There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,\" he said.\n\nThe legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendo's favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline \"Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game.\" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan \"From Russia with fun.\"\n\nPajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. \"And they've been fine so far,\" he said.\n\nPajitnov and Rogers in 2018.\n\nIn 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknames\n\nTetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as \"the Tetris Effect.\"\n\nTo date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.\n\nThe latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the game's 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called \"Tetris 99,\" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the world's best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.\n\n\"It hasn't lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,\" said Henk Rogers, explaining the game's enduring popularity.\n\n\"It's like 'Happy Birthday.' There have been lots of songs that come and go, but 'Happy Birthday' is it still always sung in the same way. Tetris has become the 'Happy Birthday' of computer games.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tetris-video-game-history/index.html", "published": "2019-11-01T02:16:01+00:00"}, {"title": "Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hat at the 1961 presidential inauguration", "text": "Written by Matthew Ponsford, CNN\n\nDelving into the archives of pop culture history, \"Remember When?\" is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nRemember when Jackie Kennedy attended her husband's presidential inauguration with a perfect egg-shaped pillbox hat perched atop her head?\n\nThat's because it was meant to be unmissable.\n\nEverything that happened on January 20, 1961 was stage-managed to tell America that a new age was dawning. John F. Kennedy was set to become the first US leader born in the 20th century, the first Catholic commander-in-chief and the first president whose inaugural speech was beamed across crackly television screens in color\n\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,\" he implored a nation in need of reassurance and leadership at the height of the Cold War.\n\nPresident Kennedy with First Lady Jackie at his inauguration.

Eight inches of snow fell on Washington DC overnight, winds lashed and, among all this, one accident would end up infiltrating American wardrobes.\n\nJackie's orb-like hat had been made to match a coat and fawn dress already created for her by her personal courtier Oleg Cassini. But it was also designed to look different: A cloth pillbox was exactly what everyone else would not be wearing.\n\nIn the freezing cold, many of the women sported stolid mink caps -- except Jackie, who stood out as the beacon of a new generation, characterized by clean lines and elegance. She appeared on the steps of the Capitol like \"the gorgeous petal in a dowdy bouquet of fur,\" according to Thurston Clarke, author of \"Ask Not,\" a book about the 1961 inauguration.\n\nJackie's distinctive headpiece was designed by Halston (real name Roy Halston Frowick). Later known as the creator of the free-flowing, slinky fashion of the 1970s disco era, Halston was then an up-and-coming New York milliner. He apparently spent hours sandwiched between two mirrors, shaping Jackie's hat into a perfect, simple dome.\n\nExcept, of course, it didn't end up like that.\n\nMeet America's first superstar fashion designer\n\nThat morning, as she reached up to clasp the hat in high winds, Kennedy accidentally gave it a dimple -- a shallow indent, unnoticed but broadcast around the world. America swooned nonetheless. Kennedy's deification as the ultimate first lady of fashion had begun with a misshapen hat, its influence stretching to imitators from high society to the rural Midwest. Halston later laughed that \"everybody who copied it put a dent in it.\"\n\nJackie's ensemble that day -- which she completed with a sable circlet and muff -- has become one of the most celebrated of presidential inauguration looks. But there's one thing we may have all been getting wrong: the color.\n\nWhile most Americans will remember the first lady in duck-egg blue , complementing JFK's steel blue waistcoat and tie, color film footage from \"Halston,\" a new CNN Films documentary about the legendary designer, shows her inauguration outfit appearing pinkish. And researchers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, where the outfit is stored, told CNN that the dress and hat were basically colorless -- a neutral, fawnish beige and not even slightly blue.\n\nThe origin of the mistake seems to be a color photograph from Life Magazine . But the cover of the same issue featured a very different photograph: Jackie in far less vivid tones, closer to the off-white captured by the handful of other press photographers present (early color film often struggled to match real hues).\n\nSo when, in 2017, Melania Trump wore a powder blue Ralph Lauren inauguration suit likened to Kennedy's, was it a tribute to an outfit that never existed?\n\nwas Melania Trump paying tribute to a dress that wasn't really blue?

She wore one the day JFK was shot, twinned with a raspberry pink suit. The blood-covered suit is locked away in the National Archives, with instructions that it should hidden from public view until at least 2103 . The pink hat hasn't been seen since the fateful day she last wore it.\n\nBut the eulogizing of the first lady's \"looks\" risks relegating her to the role of a mere mannequin, when she in fact directed much of the new administration's aesthetic -- and not just when it came to fashion.\n\nShe may have spent fewer than three years in the White House, but during that time she brought in designers, including St\u00e9phane Boudin, to modernize its interior. She also worked with legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy, the man behind the Lucky Strike cigarette packet and classic Studebaker cars, to choose the enduring powder blue of the US presidential plane, Air Force One.\n\nJFK's inauguration marked the beginning of a new era of media-savvy presidents -- and he had his wife to thank for much of it.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/jackie-kennedy-inauguration-pillbox-hat-remember-when/index.html", "published": "2019-08-08T12:56:09+00:00"}, {"title": "How ancient Egyptian cosmetics influenced our beauty rituals", "text": "Written by Julia Wolkoff\n\nThis article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\nThe mysteries of the ancient Egyptians are vast, but their beauty tricks are no secret. Makeup might seem like a modern phenomenon -- one that has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry -- but cosmetics were equally important to daily life in the ancient world. From the earliest era of the Egyptian empire, men and women from all social classes liberally applied eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipstick and rouge.\n\nThe perceived seductiveness of Egyptian civilization has a lot to do with how we've glamorized its two most famous queens: Cleopatra and Nefertiti. In 1963, Elizabeth Taylor defined the chic Egyptian look when she portrayed Cleopatra in the eponymous epic. In 2017, Rihanna (herself a makeup magnate) perfected it when she paid tribute to Nefertiti on the cover of Vogue Arabia. In their homages, both beauty icons wore saturated blue eyeshadow and thick, dark eyeliner.\n\nYet ancient Egyptians didn't only apply makeup to enhance their appearances -- cosmetics also had practical uses, ritual functions, or symbolic meanings. Still, they took their beauty routines seriously: The hieroglyphic term for makeup artist derives from the root \"sesh,\" which translates to write or engrave, suggesting that a lot of skill was required to apply \"kohl\" or lipstick (as anyone who has tried to emulate beauty tutorials on YouTube can attest).\n\nThe most refined beauty rituals were carried out at the toilettes of wealthy Egyptian women. A typical regimen for such a woman living during the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2030-1650 B.C.) would have been indulgent, indeed. Before applying any makeup, she would first prepare her skin.\n\nA detail of a painting from the tomb of Nakht depicting three ladies at a feast.

She could apply incense pellets to her underarms as deodorant, and floral- or spice-infused oils to soften her skin. Egyptians also invented a natural method of waxing with a mixture of honey and sugar. \"Sugaring,\" as it's called today, has been revived by beauty companies as a less painful alternative to hot wax.\n\nAfter all this, a servant would bring in the many ingredients and tools necessary to create and apply her makeup. These apparatuses, containers and applicators were themselves lavish art objects that communicated social status. Calcite jars held makeup or unguents and perfumes and containers for eye paint and oils were crafted from expensive materials like glass, gold or semi-precious stones. Siltstone palettes used to crush materials for kohl and eyeshadow were carved to resemble animals, goddesses or young women.\n\nCosmetic Spoon in the Shape of Swimming Woman Holding a Dish, ca. 1390-1352 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThese symbols represented rebirth and regeneration, and the act of grinding pigments on an animal palette was thought to grant the wearer special capabilities by overcoming the creature's power. (Members of the lower classes used more modest tools when applying their own makeup.)\n\nThe servant would create eyeshadow by mixing powdered malachite with animal fat or vegetable oils. While the lady sat at her toilette, before a polished bronze \"mirror,\" the servant would use a long ivory stick -- perhaps carved with an image of the goddess Hathor -- to sweep on the rich green pigment. Just as women do today, eyeshadow would be followed with a thick line of black kohl around her eyes.\n\nThis part of the routine had practical purposes beyond beautifying the wearer. Kohl was used by both sexes and all social classes to protect the eyes from the intense glare of the desert sun. The Egyptian word for \"makeup palette\" derives from their word meaning \"to protect,\" a reference to its defensive abilities against the harsh sunlight or the \"evil eye.\" Additionally, the toxic, lead-based mineral that it was made from had antibacterial properties when combined with moisture from the eyes.\n\nCombs with Carved Animals, ca. 3900-3500 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe final touches to this lady's makeup would, of course, be red lipstick -- a classic look even today. To make the paint, ochre was typically blended with animal fat or vegetable oil, though Cleopatra was known to crush beetles for her perfect shade of red. These highly toxic concoctions, often mixed with dyes extracted from iodine and bromine mannite, could lead to serious illness, or sometimes death -- possibly where the phrase \"kiss of death\" derives from.\n\nTweezer-Razor, ca. 1560-1479 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nIn death, too, personal appearance was crucial to Egyptian identity. Burial sites uncovered from the very beginning of the society's history, in pre-dynastic times, show that it was common for Egyptians to include everyday items like combs, scented ointments, jewelry and cosmetics in the graves of men, women and children (many graves have been found with makeup still inside them).\n\nWe might closely associate the Egyptians with their dramatic beauty looks largely because of their prolific use on mummies and death masks. Instead of depicting their subjects' real features, these cartonnage masks and wooden coffins portray idealized youths with smooth skin and kohl-rimmed eyes.\n\nCosmetic Dish in the Shape of a Trussed Duck, ca. 1353-1327 B.C. Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nIn fact, mummification itself followed many of the daily self-care rituals Egyptians followed while alive. Unguents for softening the skin took on religious significance when they were used to anoint the body, and even cosmetics were sometimes applied.\n\nThe singular Egyptian aesthetic -- from architecture to art to makeup -- has captured the modern imagination for its elegance, exoticism and style. Yet the ancient kingdom's influence on our beauty ideals is more direct through its inventions, down to the eyeliner and lipstick we still love to wear.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ancient-egypt-beauty-ritual-artsy/index.html", "published": "2019-06-03T09:28:52+00:00"}, {"title": "Vintage photos show the heroes of the US suffrage movement", "text": "Written by Bridey Heing, CNN\n\nAt Washington's National Portrait Gallery, the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which gave men and women equal voting rights, is being marked by \"Votes for Women: A Portrait of Persistence,\" a comprehensive exhibition that highlights the key figures and moments in the decades-long fight for women's voting rights.\n\nOriginally set to open on March 1 (it was delayed by the recent government shutdown, which shuttered the Smithsonian network of museums), the exhibition tells part of the complex story of how we reached where we are today, throwing into relief the struggle for women's suffrage and the place of women's voices within the politics of the last century.\n\n\"Liberty and Her Attendants (Suffragettes Tableau),\" staged in front of the Treasury Building in Washington in 1913.

The famed purple, white and yellow banners carried by suffragists are featured alongside artworks created by women involved in the movement, photographs of women who ran for the presidency as early as the mid-1800s, and a video installation that uses images from the National Women's Party.\n\nLucy Burns -- seen here in jail in 1917 -- was imprisioned six times while protesting for women's rights.

It came out of the abolitionist movement,\" Lemay said of the often-obscured links between the suffrage movement and broader American history. \"For whatever reason it hasn't made its way to the forefront of the American mindset when we think about American history.\n\nA portrait of Sojourner Truth c. 1870. Born into slavery around 1797, she was both an abolishionist and campaigner for women's rights. Credit: Courtesy National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nBy placing women's suffrage within the broader context of women's lives, Lemay hopes to highlight the role women have played in the story of their country: \"This exhibition lets us rethink and reconsider who we put at the forefront of history.\"\n\nA complicated legacy\n\nWhile much of the exhibition celebrates the white women who became famous during the fight for suffrage, the exhibition also explores the racial tensions that complicates their legacy and highlights the work of women of color. Despite being at the forefront of the movement, women of color -- particularly black women -- are often excluded from conversations about the movement, and their struggle for voting rights after the passage of the 19th Amendment is too often left out completely. For example, Native American men and women did not gain the right to vote until 1924, when they were granted citizenship, and due to Jim Crow-era laws like poll taxes and literacy tests, black people did not fully gain the vote until 1965.\n\nLemay wanted to avoid those blind spots. \"Black women were organizing just as much as white women,\" she says, pointing out that their exclusion from national organizations and movements prompted black women to start their own organizations.\n\nA 1898 portrait of Yankton Dakota Sioux writer and activist Zitkala-sa, who campaigned for the citizenship rights of Native Americans. Credit: Courtesy National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nHowever, that obscured history posed frustrating curatorial challenges. Because of their marginalized position, women of color were less likely than their white peers to be the subject of oil paintings and large photographs -- the sorts of objects viewers traditionally see as markers of importance and influence. With this in mind, Lemay was careful to include similarly sized photographs of figures within the movement, rather than risk throwing some in a more celebratory light than others.\n\nFinding photos of women of color taking part in protests was also a challenge. For example, a grainy scanned newspaper image was the only representation she was able to find of African-American journalist and civil rights leader Ida B. Wells at the historic 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession -- the first parade of its kind in Washington -- where she refused to march at the back with the other black participants, as she was told to by organizer Alice Paul. (Paul had wanted the parade to be segregated.)\n\nA 1884 portrait of Mary E. Church Terrell, one of the first African-American women to earn a college degree.

Lemay characterizes these fights as a \"lonely road\" too often overlooked in favor of celebrating the success of the early suffrage movement.\n\nA c. 1870 portrait of Victoria Claflin Woodhull, who ran for President of the United States in 1872. Credit: Courtesy Fine Arts Library, Harvard University\n\nBy framing the movement and its successes within the larger conversation around citizenship, the rights it brings and the ways in which those rights are denied to others, \"Votes for Women\" moves past simplistic narratives and reminds visitors that fights for citizenship and human rights are always intertwined and never over.

Several inmates have alleged abuses at the prison, which CNN has reported\n\nThe immediacy and horror of this situation tend to conceal a poignant structural condition that is the underlying cause of the socialist revolution led by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and of the political impasse that afflicts Venezuela today.\n\nEl Helicoide is a microcosm of the contradictions written into Venezuela's modern history. A promise of instant \"first world\" development amid ever-expanding slums.\n\nThe book Downward Spiral: El Helicoide's Descent from Mall to Prison (2018) , which I edited along with cultural historian Lisa Blackmore, presents the history of the building and of its many failures and contradictions along with archival photography and personal testimonies that attest to the building's original grandeur and eventual collapse.\n\nOriginally conceived as a monumental showroom for the country's emerging oil and mineral industries, El Helicoide was built between 1956 and 1961 and would have been the largest and most state-of-the-art mall in the Americas.\n\nThe former shopping center is now the headquarters of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN).

The sculpted hill was then poured over with concrete, creating two interlocked spirals with two-and-a-half miles of vehicular ramps where drivers could park in front of their stores of choice. The 645,834 square feet structure would have housed 300 upscale stores, eight cinemas, a hotel, and a heliport, among many other consumer conveniences.\n\nAt a cost of $10 million (equivalent to $90 million today), El Helicoide would have featured the technology of the time, including closed television circuits and hi-speed custom-made Austrian elevators that never made it out of their cases and were eventually looted. Its geodesic dome -- the first of those inspired by Buckminster Fuller's famous blueprint to be installed outside the United States -- was stored for 20 years before being mounted in one of the building's many failed recovery projects.\n\nMeant to become the symbol of an ultra-modern Caracas and a rapidly developing Venezuela, El Helicoide's daring size and form were widely admired: the structure was prominently featured in MoMA's 1961 Roads exhibition on highways as a new form of architecture (with El Helicoide originally combining transportation with an exhibition and commercial center), and appeared on the covers of major international magazines.\n\nYet as photos of its striking models starred across the globe, the construction site in Caracas was coming to a stop. After the fall of dictator Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez (1952-1958), the building's architects -- Jorge Romero Guti\u00e9rrez, Pedro Neuberger and Dirk Bornhorst -- were suspected of having received financial help from the military regime. Although never documented or proven, this allegation was used by the incoming democratic government, which refused to guarantee the international credits necessary to finish the structure.\n\nEl Helicoide was built in the 1950s.

Courtesy proyectohelicoide.com.jpg\n\nA complicated litigation between the construction firm, the store owners (a novel form of fundraising) and the state arose. Apparently even Nelson Rockefeller, who had several businesses in Venezuela (foremost among them the Creole Petroleum Corporation, which was for several years the most important oil producer in the world), became interested in buying El Helicoide, but red tape made it impossible. The construction firm went bankrupt and all work on the building ceased by 1961, one year short of its completion. Left in raw concrete, years of abandonment followed. In 1975, the structure passed to the hands of the state.\n\nEl Helicoide is surrounded by shantytowns, locally known as barrios, namely those of San Agust\u00edn del Sur. Like so many other barrios that now represent more than half of Caracas' built environment, this community started as shacks built by rural migrants in the mid-19th century, growing exponentially after the discovery of oil in 1918 and the industrial modernization of Caracas that started in the late 1930s.\n\nThe building's construction coincided with the wide-ranging, state-led projects created to demolish such informal housing developments at the time, and played a crucial role in the urban planning of mid-century Caracas. As such, El Helicoide's futuristic 1950s form embodied the dramatic contrast between an oil-fueled modernization, devised to propel the country from a semi-feudal economy into a 20th century industrial powerhouse, and the enormous social inequities on which this process rode. These disparities, which kept 80% of Venezuelans in misery, paved the way to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nHad this self-styled socialism kept its promises, the barrios' inhabitants would have been provided with proper housing and living conditions. Instead, San Agust\u00edn del Sur is now considered one of the most dangerous shantytowns in Caracas. Its residents have suffered through El Helicoide's different phases, starting when sections of the community were razed to make way for the building; continuing with the 1979-1982 \"Great Occupation,\" when 10,000 people stayed in the building for three years in dire conditions; and enduring since 1985 a different sort of threat once the intelligence police (then DISIP, now SEBIN) was officially granted a 15-year lease for the building's two lower levels, where the prisoner's cells are located.\n\nAlthough it held political prisoners since the beginning of this last occupation, El Helicoide's role as a spiral jail and torture center became publicly visible after the massive protests of 2014 and 2017, when hundreds of students were taken and retained there illegally , some for months and even years.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long denied cases of torture there. For instance, in May 2018 Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek Saab speaking with CNN Espanol rejected prisoners' claims of torture, extortion and minors being held inside the center.\n\nThis year, as the Maduro government has been increasingly cornered by the National Assembly and the international powers that are declaring his second mandate illegitimate, governmental repression has brutally focused on the barrios of Caracas. Their inhabitants, formerly the proud followers of a Bolivarian Revolution that gave them hope and dignity, have been the most affected by its failure. They now fight against the official armed forces of a government that claims to protect them while striking their communities with violent night raids away from TV cameras and social media.\n\nOnce hailed as the would-be icon of Venezuela's fast paced modernity, El Helicoide's downward spiral sadly represents the collapse of a national dream built on untenable social divisions.\n\nOne can only hope that both country and building will rise from their current situation and meet the challenges of a country whose vast oil reserves still hold an unfulfilled potential. For this to happen, justice must be served for the country's political prisoners, but also for its ever-present masses of urban poor.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/helicoide-venezuela-olalquiaga-intl/index.html", "published": "2019-02-10T10:29:20+00:00"}, {"title": "CNN Style", "text": "CNN Style continued to expand as a destination for a truly global perspective on the creative industries whilst pushing the boundaries of digital and video storytelling.

It put the number who turned out as \"millions\" although this is yet to be verified.\n\nPeople cried while others clutched pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed his coffin over their heads and \"death to America\" chants were heard.\n\nHis daughter Zeinab Soleimani warned the US it faces a \"dark day\" for the killing. \"Crazy Trump, don't think that everything is over with my father's martyrdom,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Vast crowds turned out for the funeral\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Among those there was Esmail Ghaani, the new head of Quds\n\nFollowing Monday's funeral, the general's remains will then be taken to Qom, one of the centres of Shia Islam, for a ceremony ahead of a funeral in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday.\n\nHow has Iran responded to the killing?\n\nOn Sunday Iran declared it would no longer abide by any of the restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nThe deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nBut in a statement, Iran said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development.\n\nThree European parties to the deal - Germany, France and the UK - urged Iran to abide by its terms.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave. US forces were invited to return to Iraq to help defeat the Islamic State group.\n\nThe new head of Iran's Quds force has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East.\n\nHow has Trump reacted?\n\nFollowing warnings from Iran, Mr Trump said that the US would respond in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, \"perhaps in a disproportionate manner\".\n\nHe repeated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites, saying the US would \"strike very fast and very hard\" if Tehran attacked Americans or US assets.\n\nPresident Trump also threatened severe sanctions against Iraq if US troops left.\n\n\"We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,\" he told reporters.\n\nWhat are Iran's key cultural sites?\n\nThe suggestion that the US could target Iranian cultural sites sparked alarm in Iran and beyond.

assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.\n\nIn a joint statement with Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron they said the current cycle of violence \"must be stopped\".\n\nMr Johnson will meet key ministers later and has discussed the deepening crisis with US President Donald Trump.\n\nIran has vowed revenge after General Soleimani was killed in a US strike.\n\nIn the joint statement, issued on Sunday night, Mr Johnson and his French and German counterparts urged restraint and called on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation.\n\nThe three leaders said they were concerned by the \"negative\" role Iran has played in the region but called on \"all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility\".\n\nTrump call\n\nWith tensions rising in the region following the drone strike ordered by President Trump, Iran has responded by vowing revenge and announcing it will no longer abide by the restrictions in its 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nIn the statement, the three leaders urged the country to \"reverse all measures inconsistent with\" the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson is preparing to assemble key ministers to discuss the spiralling crisis in the Middle East.\n\nThe prime minister said he spoke to Mr Trump on Sunday about the assassination of the Iranian general, who spearheaded the country's military operations in the Middle East as head of the elite Quds Force.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders had discussed the current situation and \"reaffirmed the close alliance between the two countries\".\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Mr Johnson accused Soleimani of \"destabilising\" the region\n\nEarlier on Sunday, in his first public statement since Soleimani's death, Mr Johnson said the 62-year-old had been \"responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region\".\n\n\"Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n\"It is clear, however, that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no-one's interest.\"\n\nMr Johnson said the UK was in \"close contact\" with all sides to encourage de-escalation and said Parliament will be updated when it returns on Tuesday.\n\nNazanin concern\n\nOn Monday, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Breakfast one \"heartbreaking\" result of the crisis was that it is now going to be \"much harder\" to secure the release of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\n\nShe is jailed in Iran over spying allegations that she denies.\n\nMr Hunt also said the UK and Europe needs to recognise there is a \"fault line\" in the Western alliance due to a \"disparity in defence spending\".\n\n\"When it comes to big matters of global security we're not putting our money where our mouth is,\" he said.\n\nMr Trump has made repeated complaints over the defence spending of other Nato allies.\n\nIn terms of its gross domestic product (GDP, the total value of goods produced and services) the US spent roughly 3.4% on defence in 2019, according to Nato estimates, while the average in European Nato countries and Canada was 1.55%.\n\nMeanwhile, retired army officer Sir Simon Vincent Mayall warned on Radio 4's Today programme that British troops serving in the Middle East could \"possibly\" be killed in retaliation attacks on US soldiers.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence adviser said western allied troops stationed in neighbouring Iraq were \"joined at the hip\" and that casualties could be shared in Iraq if Iran hits back.\n\nIraqi MPs have responded to the drone strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence in their country.\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote.\n\n'Shared threat'\n\nAbout 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200.\n\nA UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group.\n\n\"We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, HMS Montrose and HMS Defender are to start accompanying UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, where a tanker was seized by Iran last July.\n\nMedia playback is

learned of the US attack on Soleimani \"as it happened\", spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Sunday morning.\n\nMr Raab defended the killing because of the US's \"right to self-defence\" against Soleimani's use of militia's to destabilise the region and attack Western forces.\n\nHe also defended Mr Johnson for being on holiday as the crisis unfolded, saying that he had been \"in constant contact with the prime minister over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues\".\n\nShadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry accused the prime minister of \"sunning himself\" while the chief civil servant chaired three meetings of Cobra, the government's emergency response committee.\n\nShadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, who is standing to be Labour deputy leader, said Mr Johnson's response was \"pathetic\", adding that he should stand up to a US president \"recklessly threatening to launch a war\"."}, {"link":

It has been a perfect storm over the past few years\", says Mr Hawes.\n\n\"It's really no surprise the market has been declining. That's why we need a return of confidence and strong economic conditions\".\n\nThe situation is not expected to improve this year, however, with the SMMT forecasting a further 1.6 % fall in registrations in 2020.\n\nElectric and hybrid cars\n\nOne area in which sales have increased dramatically over the past year is the market for 'alternatively fuelled vehicles', in other words electric cars and hybrids. They rose by more than a fifth. Registrations of pure-electric cars were up 144%, albeit from a very low level.\n\nThe problem for the industry is that this increase is not happening nearly fast enough. New EU rules which are being phased in this year, and which enter fully into force in 2021, oblige manufacturers to cut the average CO2 emissions of their new car fleets dramatically - or face swingeing fines.\n\nThese targets are expected to remain in force, even after the UK has left the EU. But they imply a cut of more than a third in overall CO2 output, and the industry believes that meeting them will be extremely challenging.\n\nIn fact, the SMMT calculates that without other changes, the market share of electric vehicles would have to rise from the current 1.6% to 27% - or the combined share of electric vehicles and hybrids would have to increase from 7.4% to 56%.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn reality, manufacturers will not rely solely on selling more low- or zero-emission vehicles in order to meet the targets, they will also be able to withdraw their most-polluting models and sell more efficient petrol and diesel vehicles, for example.\n\nBut sales of electric and hybrid vehicles will still need to rise very substantially, and Mr Hawes insists government must play a role.\n\n\"These are still expensive technologies. They carry a price premium,\" he says.\n\n\"That's why incentives are so significant in determining the uptake.\"\n\nBrexit\n\nBut of all the clouds hanging over the industry, one remains darker than the rest in the eyes of the SMMT: the aftermath of Brexit.\n\nAlthough the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January, what happens after the transition period remains uncertain.\n\nThe government insists it will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.\n\nBut if that doesn't happen, there remains the possibility that the movement of cars and car parts across the channel could be subject to steep tariffs or disruptive border checks and delays.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"That is probably the clear and present danger,\" says Mr Hawes\n\n\"Yes, we will always sell cars in the UK and buy cars in the UK. Where they come from will be affected by Brexit. How much you pay will be affected by Brexit.\"\n\n\"That is right before us now.\""}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-51003504", "published": "2020-01-06T08:17:37", "title": "Australia fires: Rain brings relief but huge blazes expected", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Australia's capital Canberra is engulfed in smoke\n\nRain has fallen in fire-ravaged parts of Australia and temperatures have dropped - but officials have warned that blazes will \"take off\" again.\n\nSooty rain fell down the east coast, from Sydney to Melbourne, with \"torrential\" rain reported in some parts of New South Wales (NSW).\n\nBut on Sunday night officials warned temperatures would rise by Thursday.\n\nThey also said huge fires in Victoria and New South Wales could meet to create a larger \"mega blaze\".\n\n\"There is no room for complacency,\" NSW state Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned on Monday morning.\n\n\"This morning it is all about recovery, making sure people who have been displaced have somewhere safe.\"\n\nDespite the respite, haze pollution remained dangerously high.\n\nThe National Gallery of Australia in Canberra was shut on Monday \"to mitigate any risk to the public, staff and works of art on display\".

His successor is expected to be in place before council and mayoral elections at the start of May.\n\nA sixth contender, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, is also expected to throw her hat into the ring. She is close to Mr Corbyn's inner circle and represented Labour in an election TV debate.\n\nA new deputy leader also has to be elected after Tom Watson stepped down in December and Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) will also set the rules for that contest.\n\nShadow education secretary Angela Rayner - who is expected to back Ms Long Bailey for leader - is set to launch her candidacy for deputy in Stockport later.\n\nShadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood have already confirmed they intend to run for the post of deputy.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Rebecca Long Bailey is yet to formally enter the leadership race\n\nThe NEC will hold its meeting to determine the structure of the contest a day before Parliament returns from its Christmas recess.\n\nIn order to qualify to take part, candidates need the support of at least 21 MPs, as well as the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions.\n\nOne of the key issues to be decided is the cut-off period for membership.\n\nThe party's rules currently state that anyone who wants to join as a full member and vote in the leadership contest, has at least two weeks to sign up - but the NEC could extend this period.\n\nThat would most likely favour candidates such as Birmingham Yardley MP Ms Phillips and Ms Nandy, MP for Wigan, who are looking to persuade former supporters of the party - disillusioned about its direction under Mr Corbyn - to rejoin.\n\nIn contrast, those contenders who appear to be more popular with the current left-wing and pro-Remain membership, such as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir, are likely to benefit from a more restricted timetable.\n\nIf this sounds like a drab technical meeting, don't be foxed. The decisions taken by this group could influence the outcome of the contest.\n\nIf the left-leaning National Executive Committee fears an invasion of the centrists, it could opt to restrict the joining window for registered supporters to a mere porthole, and up the cost even further.\n\nIf, on the other hand, they think more people might join to keep the Corbyn flame burning, they can - if they wish - do the opposite.\n\nNow, all this may sound desperately cynical - but last time around, when Owen Smith unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn, a dispute over the leadership rules ended up in the courts.\n\nRead more on why timings are so important in this contest.\n\nThe NEC will also decide the rules around the participation of registered supporters.\n\nSince 2015, non-party members have been able to sign up temporarily at a reduced cost to cast a vote. When Mr Corbyn first became leader in 2015, people were given two months to sign up for a small fee of \u00a33.\n\nA year later - when he was challenged by Owen Smith - the NEC gave them just two days and the fee went up to \u00a325.\n\nHowever, more people signed up in 2016, with about 120,000 registered supporters ultimately taking part.\n\nThe NEC is an elected body made of up parliamentarians, councillors, trade unionists and constituency party members.\n\nWhile Ms Long Bailey is entitled to attend as one of three shadow cabinet members, she is not expected to be there given her own likely position in the forthcoming contest."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50986015", "published": "2020-01-06T00:01:27", "title": "Harvey Weinstein trial: 'Why I broke my silence'", "text": "Video\n\nJasmine Lobe is a \"silence breaker\", one of the dozens of women who have come forward to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault after allegations about his behaviour became public in 2017.\n\nAhead of the Hollywood producer's trial on criminal charges, she spoke to the BBC's Nick Bryant about what a guilty verdict would mean for alleged survivors.\n\nMr Weinstein is accused of raping one woman in a hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another in his apartment in 2006.

Anxiety central is what it feels like!\" laughs the singer.\n\n\"I could give you the pretty answer but, honestly, it feels like when you go to Winter Wonderland and you get on that huge tower that rises up above Hyde Park then - whomp - it drops and your stomach rises to your eyeballs.\n\n\"It's half an incredible feeling because there's so much adrenalin, but the other half is like, 'I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die!'\"\n\nThe 21-year-old, who is of Bangladeshi-Irish descent, first came to attention when she posted a cover of Hit The Road Jack to YouTube as a teenager.\n\nSince then, she's developed a sound that combines the eclectic range of music her father played as he drove her to her weekly Irish dancing lessons.\n\n\"My dad wanted to give me a real education, from Nick Cave to King Tubby to all this Pakistani music,\" she says. \"He'd say, 'This is from your ends of the world, you should hear this.'\"\n\nTo celebrate her position on the Sound of 2020 list, Crookes took a break from recording her actual debut album to chat about her rise to fame, impersonating Liberty X, hustling her school-friends, and the pressure to succeed.\n\nThe top five acts on the BBC Sound of 2020 list are being revealed in a countdown, with one revealed every day until the winner is announced on Thursday, 9 January.\n\nWhat's your first memory?\n\nWhen I was three or four I went into my mum's room and put on her knee-high boots, then I summoned my family like, 'Mum! Dad! Assemble!'\n\nThey sat on the sofa, and I walked in and performed Just A Little by Liberty X. We had it on VHS and I stood in front of the TV doing the moves.\n\nAmazing song choice.\n\nMaybe not for a three year old! I remember the night before, I got my mum to cut a hole in my black vest because the girls in the video had leather PVC suits with holes where their cleavage would be. I mean, I didn't have cleavage at three or four, but I wanted to look like them.\n\nSo your first memory is a musical one?\n\nYeah, it's so vivid in my mind. I was so, so concentrated on that performance. I hadn't even practiced it, I was just like, \"This is my time to shine!\"\n\nImage copyright Joy Crookes Image caption The singer has also been nominated for the Brits rising star award\n\nI heard you were quite an entrepreneur as a child, too...\n\nWhere did you find that out?! But, yeah, when I was about nine, I worked out it would cost me \u00a380 to get everyone in my family Christmas presents. So I went to Poundland in Elephant and Castle, and you could buy a box of 10 candy canes for \u00a31. I worked out that if I sold each of them for \u00a31, I could make 900% profit.\n\nI also had a side hustle selling clothes, because that \u00a380 needed to come quick. If someone said, \"That top looks great on you\", I'd say, \"I'll give it to you for a fiver\".\n\nWhen my mates came round to our house, little did they know, it wasn't playtime, it was selling time!\n\nIf music doesn't work out, you can always apply for the Apprentice.\n\nI probably will!\n\nYou grew up listening to music - but was there a point where you thought, \"This is something I can do for a career?\"\n\nI never had that epiphany because I never thought music was a legitimate job. I thought that pop stars were pop stars and that's who they were. I almost didn't see them as human beings until Kate Nash came about.\n\nShe made me realise I could use music as a diary. I was going through a lot at home and I didn't have anyone to talk to, so I just used my guitar. But I didn't really think, \"Oh, I'm a musician now\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The singer-songwriter is self-taught on the guitar, piano and bass\n\nHow did you learn to play?\n\nWith piano, I learnt a couple of chords at school, then I taught myself the songs from the film Once by looking up the chords on YouTube. With guitar it was the same: I learnt two chords from a family friend, then I went home and learned a lot of Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber songs because, no offence, I thought they'd be easy.\n\nI used to have a cupboard that had a mirror on it, so I'd sit down and watch myself playing guitar. That's really good when you're learning, because you can watch where your hands are going.\n\nSo that was my mentality, and then I started writing after that.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nMy mum's friend had a son who was my age who played the most incredible Brazilian guitar. I loved Astrud Gilberto, so I asked him round to mine and I said, \"Do you know this song Hit The Road Jack? I think we should cover it\".\n\nSo we recorded it on iMovie, put it on YouTube and it got 500,000 views - which was mad.\n\nThings really exploded in 2017 when you played Mother May I Sleep With Danger on the YouTube channel Colors. The video's now been watched 8 million times. Did it change your career?\n\nThat song was never meant to be a single. I wrote it on my own, at the piano, on the first of January 2017. But the Colors performance made more sense than the record, because I'd been playing the song on tour. When you tour a song you get to know it - you stay over at its house, you meet its mum, you get to know the sibling it doesn't like. So by the time we did Colors, it was a walk in the park.\n\nThat performance was our third take and I remember I pretended my mum was right there and I was singing it to her.\n\nThe video really changed everything. For about six months after that, everywhere I went people would say, \"Are you Joy from Colors?\"\n\nYou thought music wasn't a viable career, so did that video force you to rewrite the story in your head?\n\nIt definitely started kicking in there. We'd gone to Germany [to make the video] and I was like, 'What do you mean I'm flying to Berlin for work, to sing songs?'\n\nBut even after that, I went for a job interview as a waitress at a Kurdish restaurant.\n\nDid you get the job?\n\nNo! As soon as I went for the interview, I regretted it. The manager was looking at me like, \"What do you mean, you can't work on most days?\"\n\nSeveral of your songs, like For A Minute and London Mine, are love letters to London. Why does it inspire you so much?\n\nThe beauty of London is that it wouldn't be London without all the immigration, and the mix of cultures and colours and the smells and the stories it contains.\n\nI grew up on a street where my neighbours are Bajan and the neighbours after that are Bengali and the neighbours after that are from Nigeria. I learned so many mannerisms and different forms of respect and stories and myths and legends from all these places. I wouldn't be the person I am without London. It inspires me to be a certain kind of woman, and a certain kind of person.\n\nImage copyright Joy Crookes Image caption Crookes is currently recording her debut album, with a self-imposed deadline of May 2020\n\nAmerican musicians often eulogise their hometowns, but it's not so common in the UK. Why is that?\n\nI love my area, and London as a whole, so I think I should sing about it and celebrate it.\n\nBut when I write about London, it's also a response to the austerity of the last 10 years. For A Minute is about growing up in an area that may not be rich or vibrant, but making the most out of things like having \u00a32 to go to the chicken shop after school. There's a lyric, \"eating sunshine every day\", that's a comment on poverty.\n\nThen I also talk about \"creamy legs in London air\" because when I was growing up all the girls from secondary school, who are mainly black and brown, would have the most moisturised legs you've ever seen in your life.\n\nSo I try and have a positive message: \"Hey, this is the sick stuff about London. If we all packed up and left, and went back to India, Yorkshire or wherever, you wouldn't know what to do. It wouldn't be London any more.\"\n\nThere's a fearlessness in the way you talk about relationships, too. I love that line in Man's World - \"I find my love in red wine\".\n\nI was very angry when I wrote that! I'm saying I find my love in something that's an object, as opposed to you. You are less important to me than a drink.\n\nAt least alcohol's always there when you need it.\n\nExactly. That's probably a very Irish message!\n\nOn a more serious note, you've been playing a new song recently that addresses your mental health...\n\nYeah, it's called Anyone But Me. The first line is, \"Seven years strong with my therapy, making mosaics of my memories,\" so there's no mucking around. It's literally like, this is how I feel: I feel like there's another person living in my head.\n\nIt's something I've battled with for a long time. I remember when I was 12, I rang up the NHS and said, \"I can't get out of bed. I'm not ill, I haven't got a cold, I just can't get out of bed\". And the guy on the other end of the phone said, \"Ah, have you heard of depression?\"\n\nHave you spoken to your therapist about how the music industry could affect your health?\n\nNo, I haven't been able to see him because I haven't had time - which is not good. And I'm kind of struggling with that now. The first album just makes me want to crap myself. I'm like, \"Why am I stressed every day, I should be excited about this? But why should I be excited when this is nerve-wracking?\"\n\nI'm massively over-thinking everything. It's like when I did my GCSEs, I was the type of person who'd leave an exam going, \"Oh my God, I failed that\". Then I got all As and A stars, and dropped out straight after.\n\nWhere does the pressure to succeed come from?\n\nIt's all me. My manager is like, \"You don't have a deadline for the album\", and I'll go, \"Yes I do. It's May.\" I've got IBS. I am the most stressed person ever.\n\nThat doesn't come across in the music\u2026\n\nThank goodness.\n\nI can't imagine what an IBS song would sound like, though.\n\nMaybe like that Mabel song, The Anxiety Anthem? I could do the IBS Anthem, and the video would be me against a green screen, and the background would be the inside of your insides.\n\nA colonoscopy?\n\nYeah! Perfect.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

They were armed with stones, sticks and iron rods, according to students' accounts.\n\n\"These were not small stones, these were big stones that could have broken our skulls,\" Professor Atul Sood told NDTV. \"I fell on the side and when I got up, I saw cars completely vandalised, including my car.\"\n\nVideos of the incident showed the campus in disarray, with broken glass and chairs flung about in some places. One video even showed the student union president bleeding from a head wound. She said she had been attacked by masked men.\n\nProfessor Sood said about 50 teachers and 200 students had been holding a meeting on the campus when the attack began.\n\nWhat do we know about the attack?\n\nThe cause of the attack and who was behind it is still unclear.\n\nStudents opposed to a hike in hostel fees have been protesting on campus against the move for the past few months.

They fear more attacks. The fear is such that many of them refused to talk on camera, fearing reprisals,\" he said.\n\nStudents have also said they will take out rallies against the violence on Monday. A group of them also protested against police \"inaction\" on Sunday night, alleging that it took them hours to get to the campus.\n\nThe attack at JNU has also struck a nerve because several universities and and cities have, in recent weeks, been seeing anti-government protests over a controversial citizenship law.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Women shield friend from being beaten with sticks by police\n\nSome of the protests led to violence on campuses, and allegations of police using excessive force.\n\nNow, further protests in support of JNU are being planned in several cities.

Since then, it has honed the tech on the streets of Moscow and Tel Aviv.\n\nYandex's fleet has clocked 1.5 million miles (2.4 million km) of autonomous driving so far.

Here, one former abattoir worker describes her job, and the effect it had on her mental health.\n\nWarning: Some readers may find this story disturbing\n\nWhen I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.\n\nIt was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it's not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.\n\nI was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.\n\nWhether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There's animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.\n\nAnd the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.\n\nWhy would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?\n\nFor me, it was because I'd already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.\n\nOn my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I'd get used to it.\n\nSoon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I'm sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You'll know if you've ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.\n\nPersonally, I didn't suffer physical injuries, but the place affected my mind.\n\nAs I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I'd witnessed throughout the day.\n\nOne skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn't just make the job easier - it's necessary for survival.\n\nThere are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.\n\nAt the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.\n\nWhenever I walked past that skip, I couldn't help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I'd participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.\n\nI know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I'll never forget the day, after I'd been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.\n\nI took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, \"It's just not right, it's not right,\" over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.\n\nEven worse than pregnant cows, though, were the young calves we sometimes had to kill.\n\nA physically demanding role\n\nOn its website, the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) says the UK meat industry has some of the highest standards of hygiene and welfare in the world.\n\nMany of its members, it says, \"are at the forefront of abattoir design with facilities designed to house the animals and help them move around the site with ease and without any pain, distress or suffering\".\n\nMeat processing in the UK employs about 75,000 people of whom approximately 69% are from other European Union member states, the BMPA notes.\n\n\"The barrier to British people taking up roles in meat processing is an unwillingness to work in what is perceived to be a challenging environment,\" it says. \"Most people, while they eat meat, find it difficult to work in its production partly because of the obvious aversion to the slaughter process but also because it is a physically demanding role.\"\n\nAt the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I'd been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.\n\nWe tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.\n\nWhen the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne. When we put the first calf in, it only came about a quarter of a way up the box, if that. We put all five calves in at once. Then we killed them.\n\nAfterwards, looking at the dead animals on the ground, the slaughterers were visibly upset.\n\nI rarely saw them so vulnerable. Emotions in the abattoir tended to be bottled up. Nobody talked about their feelings; there was an overwhelming sense that you weren't allowed to show weakness. Plus, there were a lot of workers who wouldn't have been able to talk about their feelings to the rest of us even if they'd wanted to. Many were migrant workers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, whose English wasn't good enough for them to seek help if they were struggling.\n\nA lot of the men I was working with were also moonlighting elsewhere - they'd finish their 10 or 11 hours at the abattoir before going on to another job - and exhaustion often took its toll. Some developed alcohol problems, often coming into work smelling strongly of drink. Others became addicted to energy drinks, and more than one had a heart attack. These drinks were then removed from the abattoir vending machines, but people would still bring them in from home and drink them secretly in their cars.\n\n'I'm an animal lover'\n\nFor The Food Chain, the BBC's Emily Thomas met a slaughterman at Tideford abbattoir, who described his approach to his work:\n\n\"Basically, I'm an animal lover. I don't take any pleasure in what we're doing, but if I can do it as quietly and professionally as possible, then I think we've achieved something. Just be professional, do it, then switch off - and then, when we've finished work, go home and be a normal person. It's not for everybody. I know a couple of butchers that would not walk inside this abattoir; the thought of taking something's life, they find that difficult to accept, or witness.\"\n\nListen to The Food Chain: Inside the Abbattoir\n\nAbattoir work has been linked to multiple mental health problems - one researcher uses the term \"Perpetrator-Induced Traumatic Syndrome\" to refer to symptoms of PTSD suffered by slaughterhouse workers. I personally suffered from depression, a condition exacerbated by the long hours, the relentless work, and being surrounded by death. After a while, I started feeling suicidal.\n\nIt's unclear whether slaughterhouse work causes these problems, or whether the job attracts people with pre-existing conditions. But either way, it's an incredibly isolating job, and it's hard to seek help. When I'd tell people what I did for work, I'd either be met with absolute revulsion, or a curious, jokey fascination. Either way, I could never open up to people about the effect it was having on me. Instead I sometimes joked along with them, telling gory tales about skinning a cow or handling its innards. But mostly I just kept quiet.\n\nA few years into my time at the abattoir, a colleague started making flippant comments about \"not being here in six months\". Everyone would laugh it off. He was a bit of a joker, so people assumed he was taking the mick, saying he'd have a new job or something. But it made me feel really uneasy. I took him into a side room and asked him what he meant, and he broke down. He admitted that he was plagued by suicidal thoughts, that he didn't feel like he could cope any more, and that he needed help - but he begged me not to tell our bosses.\n\nI was able to help him get treatment from his GP - and in helping him, I realised I needed to help myself too. I felt like the horrific things I was seeing had clouded my thinking, and I was in a full-blown state of depression. It felt like a big step, but I needed to get out of there.\n\nAfter I left my job at the abattoir, things started looking brighter. I changed tack completely and began working with mental health charities, encouraging people to open up about their feelings and seek professional help - even if they don't think they need it, or feel like they don't deserve it.\n\nA few months after leaving, I heard from one of my former colleagues. He told me that a man who'd worked with us, whose job was to flay the carcasses, had killed himself.\n\nSometimes I recall my days at the slaughterhouse. I think about my former colleagues working relentlessly, as though they were treading water in a vast ocean, with dry land completely out of sight. I remember my colleagues who didn't survive.\n\nAnd at night, when I close my eyes and try to sleep, I still sometimes see hundreds of pairs of eyeballs staring back at me.\n\nAs told to Ashitha Nagesh\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nTwenty million chickens are killed each week to feed consumers in the UK.

This week we speak to Mette Lykke, co-founder of fitness tracker Endomondo, and chief executive of food waste app, Too Good To Go.\n\nFor many people, leaving the stability of a well-paid job to join a start-up might seem daunting. For Danish entrepreneur Mette Lykke, it's a leap she's made not just once, but twice.\n\nBack in 2007 she was working for management consultancy firm McKinsey, but decided it was time to change direction. \"I was missing the feeling of having a real impact,\" she says.\n\nIn a serendipitous twist she was in New York when a stranger came over and handed her a postcard. It read: \"Whatever our wildest dreams may be, they only scratch the surface of what's possible.\"\n\n\"It was just a nice sign,\" the 38-year-old recalls. \"She gave it to me when I was waiting at a red light, and she just walked away.\"\n\nMette decided to go for it and partnered with fellow Danes and McKinsey colleagues, Christian Birk and \u00adJakob Jonck, to launch the personal training app Endomondo.\n\n\"I might have done it anyway,\" she says. \"But it definitely didn't feel like a coincidence at that time.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fitness app Endomondo was sold to Under Armour for $85m\n\nMette was a competitive horse-rider and for the three sports enthusiasts, launching an app to \"make fitness fun\" was a logical fit. Making a success of their Copenhagen-based idea was no walk in the park though.\n\nAt that time - 13 years ago - most phones lacked GPS. In the first few months of Endomondo there were days when no one signed up at all. \"It really felt a little bit uphill,\" she says.\n\nMette says that her upbringing helped prepare her for the hard graft. She grew up alongside her family's timber business in Ringkobing, a small town in Jutland in western Denmark. \"I grew up seeing that there are ups and downs,\" she says.\n\n\"Most days are just hard work, [but] if I had known back then that I wouldn't see any salary for the next two years, I might have reconsidered,\" she laughs. \"You just don't know.\"\n\nAs an entrepreneur, \"you're definitely an optimist,\" she explains. \"We always thought next month is going to be different.\"\n\nThe game-changer came when the Apple App Store opened in 2008 and smart phone sales boomed. But it still took Endomondo six years to make its first profit.\n\nImage copyright Too Good To Go Image caption Too Good To Go says it now has more than 18 million users\n\nBy 2015, the app had 20 million users and caught the attention of American sportswear giant, Under Armour.\n\n\"They were particularly interested in increasing brand awareness in Europe,\" says Mette. \"We could help with that, with the vast majority of [our] users being based here.\"\n\nThe US company bought Endomondo for $85m (\u00a365m). Mette was just 33 at the time, and she and her two co-founders were suddenly multimillionaires.\n\n\"It's a strange thing to sell a business you were part of creating,\" she says. \"While the deal was a big success from a business perspective and I was happy with the decision, it was still hard to let go of my baby on a personal level.\"\n\nAfter the sale she continued to work for Endomondo and its new parent, managing teams both in Copenhagen where she was based and also in Texas.\n\nIt was following a chance encounter on a bus outside Copenhagen in August 2016 that the Dane embarked on her next mission - fighting food waste. She started chatting to a fellow passenger who showed her an app called Too Good To Go.\n\n\"I was not fully aware of how big of an issue in society food waste really is,\" recalls Mette. After doing more research she was shocked to learn about its climate impact. \"That was mind-blowing to me.\"\n\nImage copyright Les Kaner Image caption Mette now employs 450 people at Too Good To Go\n\nFive young Danish entrepreneurs had launched the online marketplace several months earlier. Restaurants and shops post what leftover food they have available, together with a time-slot for collection.\n\nMembers of the public can then purchase discounted meals or groceries through the app. The surplus food is saved from being thrown away - the firm makes money by taking a cut on meals sold.\n\n\"The fact that we can help solve such a massive issue and then leave everyone as winners in the process, I thought that was really powerful,\" says Mette.\n\nShe found the start-up \"so exciting\" that she invested. Several months later she left Under Armour and joined Too Good To Go as chief executive. \"I wouldn't have jumped into this if I didn't think I could contribute,\" she says.\n\nAccording to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, one-third of the world's food is wasted. When ranked alongside countries, food waste is the world's third-largest producer of carbon dioxide after the USA and China.\n\nIn recent years dozens of firms have set out to tackle this, including similar platforms like Olio, Foodcloud and Karma. Alan Hayes, from food and grocery research group IGD, says these apps have \"helped to raise awareness of food waste in businesses and in schools\" as well as empowering consumers.\n\nWhen it comes to changing behaviour about food waste, Trish Caddy, an analyst at fellow research firm Mintel, thinks consumers respond better to rewards. \"The Too Good to Go app is particularly good at normalising eating leftovers by promoting end-of-day food at a discount,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Too Good To Go Image caption More than 30,000 food firms are signed up\n\nMette has overseen a rapid expansion. The firm now employs 450 people, operates in 13 European countries and is due to roll out in Sweden.\n\n\"Endomondo took three years to get to the first million users and with Too Good To Go it took 15 months,\" she says. \"It's just a completely different time\u2026 the technology is ready.\"\n\nMette says it is one of Europe's fastest-growing apps with 18 million users and is gaining an additional 45,000 daily. Customers range from bargain-hunting students to environmentally-conscious young families, while women over 50 are another big market. It has also partnered with more than 30,000 food suppliers, from Yo Sushi to Accor Hotels.\n\nMore The Boss features:\n\nMette describes it as a \"social impact\" company. \"Every time we make a euro in revenue, it's because we did something good.\"\n\nIt aims to ultimately be profit making, though Mette says the timeline for delivering returns isn't yet clear. \"At the moment, every revenue we make goes back into the business. Just growing it and expanding it to more and more countries. That's our focus.\"\n\nSo far the Too Good To Go team reckon they have helped save more than 25 million meals.\n\n\"I feel like this is just the beginning,\" says Mette. \"It doesn't feel like we're anywhere near the goal line at all.

So, did the Bush camp solicit foreign interference to help him win an election - the allegation that has seen President Trump impeached?\n\n\"A guy like that doesn't deserve to be president,\" President Bush told his sister about Clinton.\n\nHe viewed the young Arkansas governor, who was the same age as Bush's eldest son, as a scoundrel and felt confident he could roll over him.\n\nBut the president sorely underestimated a political thaumaturge, so gifted that his ascent to the White House had been foreseen when he was aged just seven by his school teacher.\n\nTo Bush's mystification, his saxophone-tootling challenger's popularity in opinion polls was even defying the gravity of revelations about his draft-dodging past.\n\nThe Republican, a decorated World War 2 fighter pilot, dictated to his diary: \"I'm tired of this guy lying and ducking on the draft and not coming clean.\"\n\nBush had another problem - his campaign was as stale as the recession-sapped US economy.\n\nSo he turned for inspiration across the Atlantic to his friend, UK Prime Minister John Major.\n\nThe British premier's come-from-behind general election win in April 1992 was being touted by American conservatives as a blueprint for the US president.\n\nBush had a very special relationship with Major, his brother-in-arms from the 1990-91 Gulf War, as has previously been revealed in transcripts of their private conversations obtained by the BBC.\n\nHe once spoke of sending him \"a love letter\" and assured the British PM \"obviously we're rooting for you\" to beat Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nMajor, critics suspected, returned the favour.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTwo UK Tory panjandrums - architects of the PM's surprise victory - flew to Washington eight weeks before the US election and advised the Bush team to focus attacks on Clinton's character.\n\nThe president's campaign hired an opposition research specialist to dig for dirt in Britain.\n\nWhat happened next was either a bureaucratic mishap, or an egregious act of political meddling by the UK in the internal politics of a friendly nation.\n\nAt some point in early October 1992, the Home Office inspected its immigration nationality section to see whether Clinton had applied for British citizenship while at Oxford University from 1968-70 in order to escape the Vietnam draft.\n\nBriefing reporters on background, the department said its \"comprehensive\" check was conducted out of \"sheer helpfulness\" to the media, even though it usually always rebuffed journalists with the stock answer that it did not discuss individual cases.\n\nNothing compromising on the Democrat was discovered, though it remains an open question how any such political bombshell, had it been excavated, would have been handled by Whitehall.\n\nThat same month, a frustrated Bush would dictate to his diary that \"we cannot get this smoking gun on Clinton\".\n\nMore on US presidents\n\nAll Major could offer him were well wishes.\n\nThe British premier called Bush on Air Force One during a last burst of campaigning two days ahead of November's election.\n\n\"I wanted to wish you a great hurrah and all of my best for the home stretch,\" Major said, according to a transcript of their conversation at the Bush presidential library in Texas.\n\nBut he had backed the wrong horse - Clinton trounced Bush.\n\nReturning to the White House a day after he lost, the humiliated one-term president grew emotional, according to biographer Jon Meacham.\n\nBush dictated to his diary that he was thinking to himself: \"How in God's name did this country elect a draft dodger?\"\n\nA month later, when the Home Office publicly acknowledged having carried out the file check, the victorious Clinton did not hide his annoyance.\n\n\"They should have more pressing business,\" he said of British officials when asked about the controversy during a morning jog in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThat very same day, 6 December 1992, Major wrote a letter of apology to the US president-elect.\n\nAccording to a copy of the correspondence, declassified only last year by the UK National Archives, the British premier said he was \"disturbed by reports which have appeared about enquiries by our Home Office relating back to your time at Oxford\".\n\n\"I am only sorry,\" Major added, \"that it has been played up now in a mischievous way. I hope the mischief will be short-lived.\"\n\nThe file does not indicate that Clinton responded.\n\nLater that month, Major flew to Washington on an official working visit. He had hoped to mend fences with the president-elect during the trip.\n\nBut Clinton declined to meet him - the Washington Post described it as a snub.\n\nWith the so-called special relationship on ice, Labour MPs jeered the prime minister in the House of Commons in February 1993 as he denied taking sides in a US election.\n\nMargaret Beckett, the opposition's deputy leader, was among members of Parliament who shook her head sceptically at Major's explanation.\n\n\"No I didn't buy it,\" the MP for Derby South tells the BBC, remembering that day in the chamber 27 years ago.\n\n\"I thought at the very least there must have been a nod and wink [between the US and UK].\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bush and Clinton - pictured with Major (L) at Russian leader Boris Yeltsin's 2007 funeral - struck up a friendship after leaving office\n\n\"And probably a bit more than a nod and a wink, 'if you can find something, George [HW Bush] might be rather grateful'.\n\n\"Because it [the Home Office records search] seemed to me like the kind of thing most civil servants would be fairly wary about doing.\"\n\nWhosever idea it was, Beckett says, it was \"quite a big mistake\".\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Major - now a knight of the realm - denied approving the Home Office file search.\n\nHis spokeswoman, Dame Arabella Warburton, says: \"Sir John did, indeed, have a close working and personal relationship with President George HW Bush.\n\n\"However, Sir John neither sanctioned, nor had any knowledge of, Home Office checks being carried out on George Bush's Presidential rival Bill Clinton.\"\n\nNo-one in the Bush camp set any UK official to go rummaging for such skeletons in Clinton's closet, insists Charles Black, who was a senior adviser to the president's re-election bid.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident that nobody in the campaign asked for it,\" he tells the BBC.\n\n\"It didn't come up in the meetings I had with the [UK] Conservatives, so maybe somebody in the [US] government did.\"\n\nThe two top Tory apparatchiks who flew to Washington were Sir John Lacy and Mark Fullbrook. Lacy died in 2009 and Fullbrook declined to comment to the BBC.\n\nJames Pinkerton, who was deputy assistant to Bush and worked on the campaign, thinks his former boss' hands were clean.\n\n\"Bush was an ethical, honest guy,\" he tells the BBC, \"and if you said to him, we're going to do a dirty trick to help you win, he would've said, no.\"\n\nBut despite his reputation for civility and decency, \"the last gentleman\" - as Bush's admirers call him - did not always measure up to the ideal of noblesse oblige.\n\nIn his political life, he was fully prepared to fight dirty to win, as evidenced by the infamously race-baiting attacks he launched in 1988 to tar his then-Democratic challenger, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, as soft on crime.\n\nBush effectively blamed his rival for the torture and rape of a white couple by a black felon, Willie Horton, who had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on a weekend-release programme.\n\nAnd as Ronald Reagan's deputy, Bush blatantly lied when insisting he was \"out of the loop\" on the administration's secret effort to trade arms with Iran for hostages in violation of its own policy.\n\n\"I'm one of the few people who know the details,\" the vice-president had confided to his diary.\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush - who died one year ago, aged 94 - was an intensely competitive man.\n\nIn 1980, as his dream of capturing the Republican presidential nomination began to slip away in the wake of defeat to Reagan in New Hampshire, Bush penned a revealing note to himself on a flight.\n\n\"I WILL NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER. NEVER,\" it said in bold scrawl. He gave up three months later.\n\nSidney Blumenthal, a historian and former Clinton White House aide, tells the BBC that \"of course\" the Home Office files search was done at the behest of the British government in cahoots with team Bush.\n\nHe notes that former Bush chief of staff James Baker - who declined to speak to the BBC for this article - stated in a 1992 memo, cited recently by the New York Times, that the commander-in-chief would not have enlisted the UK to aid his campaign.\n\n\"And yet somehow the Home Office went ahead,\" Blumenthal archly adds. \"Hard to believe that they [the British government] would do this entirely unbidden.\"\n\nThe UK action might be dismissed as the suspected rogue meddling of an over-zealous ally, except that it was mirrored by a simultaneous muck-raking exercise within the Bush administration.\n\nJust as the Republican president was making an issue of his rival's past opposition to the Vietnam War, a government warehouse in suburban Maryland was being scoured for damaging information on Clinton, and even his mother.\n\nThis scandal came to be known as Passportgate.\n\nA stinging Department of State inspector general report would later implicate two Bush political appointees in having Clinton's documents unsealed. It was a fruitless bid to find out if the Democrat had ever considered renouncing his US citizenship during the Vietnam conflict.\n\nWhile the watchdog did not establish the White House had directly instigated the invasion of privacy, it found Baker was aware of the \"heinous activity\", yet did nothing to stop it.\n\nBaker was cleared three years later of any \"criminal intent\" in the matter by an independent counsel investigation set up under then-and-current US Attorney General William Barr.\n\nBeyond the suspicions, no concrete proof has emerged of collusion between Bush and Major in the US election of '92.\n\nBut even if there was, isn't what President Trump allegedly did - brazenly soliciting the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to harm the election prospects of his potential White House challenger, Joe Biden - worse?\n\nNot under US campaign finance law, according to Ann Ravel, former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIt is illegal for anyone to seek or accept anything of value from a foreign national in an American election, she points out.\n\nMs Ravel, who led the federal regulator in 2015, tells the BBC: \"It would be the equivalent of what we're seeing now [with Trump] because obviously it would be a request by the Bush White House for what is something of value to the campaign.\"\n\nThough so much about the Trump presidency is said to be unprecedented, foreign interference in elections - with the occasional connivance of unscrupulous US office-seekers - is as old as the American republic itself.\n\nAs he pursued his own political ambitions, Founding Father Thomas Jefferson enabled outrageous French meddling in US internal affairs.\n\nWhen President George Washington infuriated Paris by forging a peace treaty with Great Britain in 1794, Jefferson briefed against his commander-in-chief to the French ambassador, who was trying to wreck the accord.\n\nAs vice-president to John Adams in 1797, Jefferson was suspected of treason when he undercut his boss by sabotaging Franco-American peace talks, again via diplomatic back channels.\n\nHow prescient that a decade earlier Adams had written to a friend in France: \"As often as Elections happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.\"\n\nThat letter was addressed to Jefferson.\n\nFollow @judesheerin\n\nMore on US presidents\n\n."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50716694", "published": "2020-01-06T00:54:24", "title": "Pakistan forgiveness laws: The price of getting away with murder", "text": "The murder was so brutal it shocked even the hardened detectives who arrived at the scene on the outskirts of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Bushra Iftikhar, a 28-year-old housewife, had been stabbed with such force that the knife her assailant used had bent out of shape, and he had continued the attack with a screwdriver.\n\nThe killer? Her husband, Sami Ullah.\n\nThe couple had four children already, and at the time of her death Bushra Iftikhar was pregnant with their fifth. Why exactly her husband killed her remains unclear. He claimed in court to have been suffering a mental breakdown and to have no recollection of the incident. Her family says he accused her of wanting to convert to another religious sect.\n\nBut what does seem clear is that Sami Ullah was a violent man. He had previously been accused of the attempted murder of a neighbour, and of being part of a violent argument at a restaurant.\n\nPolice believe he should have been in prison, but instead he didn't even face a proper trial.\n\nAccording to Bushra Iftikhar's brother, Sami Ullah's family were influential in the local area and had paid money to the victims of those earlier cases.\n\n\"In the old cases, he gave money and quickly got out of prison,\" Mohammad Zakaria bluntly told the BBC.\n\nUnder Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes, including most instances of murder. All they have to do is state in court that they forgive a suspect \"in the name of God\". In reality, legal observers agree that the primary motive for that \"forgiveness\" is normally financial, and the informal payment of money to victims is not illegal.\n\nImage caption Mohammad Zakaria believes his brother-in-law became more violent after the first incidents\n\nThe provisions allowing crimes of bodily harm to be \"settled\" or \"forgiven\" were introduced in the 1990s as part of a set of Islamic-inspired legal reforms.\n\nSupporters of the system say it helps reduce pressure on Pakistan's already overburdened and delay-ridden court system, and reduces the likelihood of feuds developing. But according to one study, the murder conviction rate in the country dropped from 29% in 1990, before the laws were introduced, to just 12% in 2000.\n\nCritics argue the law can give repeat offenders a sense of impunity, and is a tool for the more powerful to evade justice. Bushra Iftikhar's brother believes the fact her killer was never punished in any of his previous cases only made him grow more violent.\n\n\"He became arrogant. He thought: 'I did this, and nothing happened. Now I'm free and the law can't touch me.'\"\n\nSami Ullah's family admit the previous cases had ended in what are often termed \"compromises\", but insist they had agreed them to avoid a drawn-out legal process, not because Sami Ullah was guilty. Sami Ullah is currently appealing against a death sentence after being convicted of murder.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Many cases never even make it to court (pictured: the Supreme Court in Islamabad)\n\nAshtar Ausaf Ali, who served as attorney general under the previous government, put forward plans to reform the laws in 2015 whilst still retaining the element of forgiveness.\n\n\"A person has the right to forgive,\" he told the BBC from his office in the city of Lahore, but he added that crime wasn't just a matter for an individual, but for society.\n\nHis idea was to introduce mandatory minimum sentences, so that \"people would know that they cannot put a price tag on a crime\".\n\nDespite being supported by some clerics, Mr Ali's proposals were blocked by a number of Islamist politicians. At the moment, there seems little prospect of them being resurrected.\n\nUndermining the system\n\nThe current law is a source of frustration at times for both police officers and criminal prosecutors. Courts do have the right to reject settlements if they believe they are coerced, but most observers agree that due to the number of cases in the court system, they rarely investigate thoroughly.\n\nMeanwhile, one detective told me he had come across dozens of examples of offenders reaching a settlement with their alleged victims only to go on to reoffend. He said the police would spend time and resources investigating a crime only for the case to end abruptly.\n\nThen there are other times, when the police themselves can be the beneficiaries of such \"settlements\".\n\nImage copyright Handout Image caption Salahuddin Ayubi died after being arrested\n\nIn August, CCTV images of a thief sticking his tongue out at the camera as he stole a bank card from a cash machine in the central Pakistani city of Faisalabad went viral on social media.\n\nBut the case took a grim turn as shortly after Salahuddin Ayubi was arrested by police, he died in custody.\n\nThe compromise\n\nSuspicions mounted after another video emerged of Salahuddin Ayubi, who apparently initially pretended to police that he was deaf and mute, writhing in pain as a policeman twisted his arms behind his back while another interrogated him.\n\nSalahuddin's father, Muhammad Afzal, initially pressed for justice for his son, who is believed to have suffered from a mental illness. However, a month later, he announced he was forgiving the policemen accused of killing him \"in the name of God\".\n\nThe \"settlement\" or \"compromise\" in that case is understood to have consisted of an agreement the authorities would build a new 8km (five-mile) road in the family's village, as well as a new gas pipeline, not to mention the payment of an undisclosed sum of money.\n\nSalahuddin's father seemed content with the deal, which was brokered by a radical cleric with links to the intelligence services. But others, who don't have powerful backers or the weight of public pressure behind them, often end up feeling as if they have no choice but to agree with what is being offered to them.\n\nIn a village outside Lahore, I met the family of another man who died in police custody. He had been detained after wrongly being accused of murder.\n\nThe BBC is not revealing the family's names in order to protect them from repercussions, but they say a mixture of coercion and money led them to drop the case against the police officers they hold responsible for his death.\n\n\"We haven't forgiven them in our hearts,\" the victim's brother told me. \"We never will, but we were helpless.\"\n\nHe said a steady stream of local politicians and influential figures had arrived on his doorstep when they began to fight for justice.\n\n\"They would say: 'Do a deal. If you don't, you won't be able to do anything anyway. Maybe they'll go to jail for six months or a year, after that they'll be freed and can make all sorts of trouble for you.'\"\n\nThe family are poor and were offered enough money to buy a house, something they would have struggled ever to do otherwise. They accepted, but the mother remained distraught at the bargain she felt forced to make.\n\n\"I wish to God that we were still living in a rented house, and my son was still alive,\" she said. \"They took my son and gave me money for a house, what kind of deal is that?\"\n\nIllustration by Nick Galvin"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50951043", "published": "2020-01-03T15:19:10", "title": "Australia fires: A visual guide to the bushfire crisis", "text": "Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.\n\nThe fires, burning since September, have intensified over the past week, with a number towns evacuated.

Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.\n\nData shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.\n\nAustralia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C.\n\nBy the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.\n\nA climate phenomenon is causing the heatwave\n\nThe main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.\n\nThe difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years.\n\nAs a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia.\n\nAndrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.\n\n\"The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,\" he says.\n\n\"A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country.\"\n\nAnd meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50987303", "published": "2020-01-05T00:47:47", "title": "Why fewer US students want to learn about UK these days", "text": "Image copyright Paul Grundy/DCMS\n\nOnce a bastion of English and History departments, the British studies discipline is waning as American students increasingly put career goals over their love of Charles Dickens, writes James Jeffrey.\n\nIt's Friday afternoon at the University of Texas at Austin, which means it's time for sherry and a weekly lecture on British studies.

History in general is down about 45% from its 2007 peak.\n\n\"The cost of college is exploding, there's this complete inflation in US higher education,\" says Professor James Vaughn, a historian specialising in Britain at Ohio University.\n\n\"If one has to attend for four years at great cost, you want some remuneration, so the STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects are seen as having massive pay-offs compared to the humanities and the social sciences.\"\n\nThis has been compounded since the financial crash of 2008, with students increasingly fearful that a humanities degree won't lead to gainful employment, says Paul Halliday, president of NACBS.\n\nNevertheless, all may not be lost for British studies.\n\n\"As the balloon of British studies has deflated, we've seen it redefining itself in terms of what it means and does,\" Kelly says. \"What we have been seeing, especially in the last decade, is British studies reorienting itself to increasingly focus on the British Empire and its lasting impact and influence around the world.\"\n\nImage copyright James Jeffrey Image caption British studies, along with other humanities, is losing students in the US\n\nThis is particularly relevant for those wanting to better understand how the US got to where it has, especially on the global stage.\n\n\"Our laws and national institutions, but also character, are so shaped by being part of the British Empire and breaking away from it,\" says Erika Rappaport, the American author of A Thirst for Empire: How Tea Shaped the Modern World.\n\n\"We can't understand the history of US global influence without understanding that Great Britain laid the groundwork, infrastructure and ideologies of globalisation while building and losing their empire in the 19th and 20th Centuries.\"\n\nRappaport became interested in British history and empire studies through a love of reading Victorian literature as a teenager that left her \"dying to find out more about the culture that produced such amazing literature\".\n\nShe says the history of the US being a former colony of the UK has created \"a love-hate relationship\".\n\n\"We share so much in terms of our consumer culture and education, but at times our tastes are very different,\" says Rappaport, citing how the US fondness for coffee stemmed from Americans turning away from British food stuffs - such as tea - because these reminded them of their colonial status.\n\nThe UT Austin British Studies programme - it is not a degree in itself - began in 1975 based on weekly lectures about English literature, history and government.\n\nSince then it has hosted many eminent speakers - CP Snow, the British novelist and scientist, spoke in 1976 on Elite Education in England; Iris Murdoch in 1985 spoke on Themes in English Literature and Philosophy; and the historian Michael Howard spoke in 1993 on Strategic Deception in the Second World War.\n\nImage copyright James Jeffrey Image caption The British Studies programme at the University of Texas at Austin has adopted a stuffed lion - the national animal of England - as its unofficial mascot\n\n\"I like the interdisciplinary ethos, how you get to meet people from other departments,\" says 34-year-old Trevor Simmons during a break in the carol singing at the recent British Studies Christmas Party. He completed a PhD in British Economic History in 2015 and still attends the weekly talks.\n\n\"It's also done in a fun way. You've got the sherry, the stuffed lion, the oak panels - it's a little bit of Oxford.\"\n\nProgramme director and founder Roger Louis says the programme strives to include a multitude of perspectives from different nations caught up in the British historical experience, ranging from Scots and Irish to Jamaicans, Indians, Australians and Nigerians.\n\n\"Ongoing discussions in British studies are engaging because of the clash of different perspectives as well as the nuance of cultural interpretation,\" Louis says.\n\nThis global aspect of British studies, Halliday says, is its greatest strength in remaining valid and competitive as the humanities try to appeal to students.\n\n\"In the last ten years there has been an explosion of interest in the field in the types of problems that are affecting everyone, such as how the consumer society was predicated on slave labour and the destruction of indigenous people,\" Halliday says. \"This re-orientation has expanded the reach of British studies.\"\n\nImage caption British studies once focused on on classic works by Victorian authors, like Charles Dickens, but now includes modern writers from nations that used to be part of the British Empire, like Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nKelly says he saw this reflected in the impressive breadth of views on display when he attended this year's annual NACBS conference in Vancouver, Canada.\n\n\"The younger faculty entering the discipline are able to research more broadly, synthesise new information and challenge the presumptions of the older faculty members,\" Kelly says. \"It's refreshing and makes you realise that British Studies isn't going anywhere soon.\"\n\n\"I view myself as a global citizen, and my dream job would be with the UN,\" 20-year-old Lucas Peralta remarked at the Christmas party, after taking British Imperialism in the Middle East as part of his International relations and global studies degree.\n\n\"So understanding the influence of the UK there and also with the likes of Nato is extremely important.\"\n\nThe ongoing impact of colonialism was on the mind of 22-year-old history undergraduate Ana Chan at the Christmas Party. She has been following the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, explaining how Britain has always been on the periphery of her life because her family came to American from Hong Kong.\n\n\"My family have mixed feelings,\" Chan says. \"They remember places they couldn't go under British colonial rule because of affordability. I've heard family friends discussing whether it was a good thing for Hong Kong to be separated from mainland China for so long given the trouble happening now. At the same time, I was raised to view Britain as a close ally of the US.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Recent issues like Brexit have fired up an interest in British studies\n\nHalliday, who teaches history, says Brexit has put Britain back on the minds of many of his students.\n\n\"Both the UK and the US have always been deeply tied to the rest of the world,\" he says. \"That's why Brexit interests my students: it reads like a reversal of centuries of British interconnection with Europe and beyond.\"\n\nHistory professor Vaughan says his students have also been drawing comparisons between the shock of Brexit and Donald Trump's unexpected election and want to discuss what \"it's all about\".\n\nUT Austin programme director Louis recalls the words of Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the US from 1948 to 1952, when he discussed the special relationship between the UK and US during a British Studies lecture given in 1989.\n\n\"He said that we are a people who have a lot in common and are trying to solve common problems,\" Louis says."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/51000472", "published": "2020-01-05T23:51:27", "title": "Watch Liverpool's Curtis Jones' stunning goal against Everton in the FA Cup third round", "text": "Watch 18-year-old Curtis Jones' spectacular winning goal for Liverpool against Everton in the FA Cup from all the angles.\n\nAvailable to UK users only\n\nWATCH MORE: Highlights: Liverpool 1-0 Everton"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50976228", "published": "2020-01-05T20:24:31", "title": "Liverpool 1-0 Everton, FA Cup third round: 'Sensationally good' Reds please Klopp", "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device All the angles: Relive Curtis Jones' stunning goal\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said his team's performance was \"sensationally good\" as Curtis Jones' stunning winner earned the Reds a fully deserved FA Cup third-round victory and extended Everton's miserable record of Anfield failure.\n\nThe German made nine changes from the side that increased their Premier League lead to 13 points with victory over Sheffield United on Thursday - including three debutants in Takumi Minamino, Nathaniel Phillips and substitute Yasser Larouci.\n\nAnd it was 18-year-old Jones who grabbed the Merseyside derby glory with a magnificent curling 25-yard drive that eluded the outstretched arms of Everton keeper Jordan Pickford as it arced into the top corner after 71 minutes.

Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.\"\n\nSeveral winners ignored his advice completely (more on their speeches in a sec), but that didn't stop the British comedian going all out as he fronted the ceremony for the fifth and apparently final time.\n\nHere are a few of his best jokes, along with five other highlights from this year's ceremony.\n\n1. Ricky Gervais reclaimed his throne\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhen Ricky Gervais first hosted the Globes in 2010, his cutting comments and sarcastic style provided a master class in ridiculing celebrities and set a blueprint for the ceremony's future hosts.\n\nThis year, he sensibly pre-empted the inevitable social media outrage over his politically incorrect gags by telling the audience: \"Remember, they're just jokes. We're all going to die soon, and there's no sequel.\"\n\nHere are a few of his best:\n\n\"I came here in a limo tonight and the licence plate was made by Felicity Huffman.\"\n\n\"Martin Scorsese said the Marvel films remind him of theme parks. I don't know what he's doing hanging around theme parks - he's not big enough to go on the rides.\"\n\n\"Knives Out has three nominations tonight. See what can happen when you don't dress people up as Cats?\"\n\n\"We were going to do an In Memoriam section, but when I saw the list of people who had died this year, it wasn't diverse enough. It was mostly white people. And I thought, 'No, not on my watch.'\"\n\n\"In a moment we're going to see a short clip from The Irishman. It's 88 minutes long.\"\n\n\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was nearly three hours long. Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere, and by the end his date was too old for him.\"\n\n\"Lots of big celebrities here tonight. Legends. Icons. On the same table, there's Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Baby Yoda. Oh no, that's Joe Pesci, sorry.\"\n\n\"Kevin Hart was fired from the Oscars for some offensive tweets. Luckily for me, the Hollywood Foreign Press can barely speak English and they've no idea what Twitter is, so I got offered this gig by fax.\"\n\n2. Several winners ignored Ricky's advice\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIn other words, used their speeches to make political statements.\n\nSome actors, including Australians Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, made reference to the bushfire crisis, connecting it with climate change.\n\nOn the subject of climate change, best drama actor winner Joaquin Phoenix praised the HFPA for only serving vegan meals to stars at the ceremony.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the HFPA for recognising and acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a very bold move making tonight plant-based, and it really sends a powerful message.\"\n\nSir Sam Mendes paid tribute to his grandfather, who fought in World War One, adding that he \"fervently hopes [a world war] never, ever happens again\".\n\nThe winner of best actress in a limited series, Michelle Williams, made a feminist speech, telling the audience: \"I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making... and I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose.\"\n\nAnd Patricia Arquette, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, made reference to the forthcoming US presidential election.\n\n\"While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world for our kids and their kids. We have to vote in 2020,\" she said.\n\n3. Ellen's acceptance speech poked fun at acceptance speeches\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\n\"The thing I like about this award is that coming in, I knew I was going win,\" joked talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as she accepted the Carol Burnett Award.\n\nThe prize recognises outstanding achievement in television and was only introduced as part of the ceremony last year.\n\nDeGeneres, who was announced as the winner in advance, also made light of several acceptance speech tropes and clich\u00e9s from the stage.\n\n\"I couldn't have done it without my husband Mark. Mark, you are my rock, thank you for supporting me through this crazy journey,\" she said to big laughs from the audience (which included her wife, Portia de Rossi).\n\n\"I know it wasn't easy for you or the kids - Rupert and Fiona, go to bed!\" she added, despite also not having any children.\n\n\"The important thing,\" she added on a more serious note, \"is that you all know me, and obviously you know me or else you wouldn't have laughed at all of that.\n\n\"I feel like we all think we know someone - there's a connection when we watch them on TV... Television inspired and influenced everything that I am today.\"\n\n4. Tom Hanks got emotional. Possibly because he had a cold\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe prestigious Cecil B DeMille Award - effectively the night's outstanding contribution prize - was given to awards season veteran and general legend Tom Hanks.\n\nHe told the audience he was feeling \"a little jittery\" because of how much orange juice he'd been drinking to try and get over a cold he'd had over the weekend.\n\nBeing ill turned out to be quite convenient, because when he became teary during his speech, he told the crowd: \"It's the cold that is making this happen. I swear to God, I'm not nearly this emotional at home.\"\n\nPaying tribute to his wife and children, he said: \"A man is blessed with a family sitting down front like that. A wife who has taught me what love is. Five kids who are wiser and braver than their old man is. I can't tell you how much your love means to me.\"\n\nAnd before he left, a provided a quick lesson in etiquette and punctuality for budding actors.\n\n\"Showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie,\" he said, to much applause.\n\n\"Those people with radios in their ears don't need to knock on your doors and say 'they're ready for you' because you're already ready. You have the freedom to settle down, because when the time comes, you have to hit the marks.\"\n\n5. One director championed subtitles (while also breaking a record)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nParasite was widely considered to be one of the best films of last year - but because it's not in the English language, it wasn't eligible for nomination in the major categories.\n\nInstead, the South Korean black comedy thriller was named the winner of best foreign language film, becoming the first ever Korean movie to triumph in the category.\n\nIts director Bong Joon-ho used his acceptance speech to encourage the public not to be put off by international films.\n\n\"Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you'll be introduced to so many amazing films,\" he said through a translator.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ocean's 8 star Awkwafina was recognised for her role in The Farewell\n\n\"Just being nominated along with fellow amazing international film-makers was a huge honour. I think we use only one language: the cinema.\"\n\nIt wasn't the only \"first ever\" of the ceremony.\n\nHildur Gudnadottir became the first solo woman to win best score for her work on Joker, while The Farewell's Awkwafina was the first woman of Asian descent to win best lead actress in a comedy or musical.\n\n6. Brad Pitt was the real Joker of the night\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio co-star in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nBrad Pitt was clearly in a playful mood as he arrived on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony.\n\nOne journalist told him: \"Everybody is waiting for you and Jennifer [Aniston, his ex-wife] to run into each other so they can take their picture.\"\n\nPitt replied: \"I'll run into Jen, she's a good friend,\" before joking that it would be \"the second most important reunion of her year\" after the rumoured Friends HBO special.\n\nLater in the night, Pitt introduced a clip of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood alongside his co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n\"When I asked Quentin [Tarantino] how he wanted us to play two ageing movie guys who were on their way out, he said 'just be yourselves',\" Pitt joked.\n\nAnd finally, as he was accepting his prize for best supporting actor towards the end of the night, Pitt paid tribute to DiCaprio while poking fun at one of his earliest major acting roles.\n\n\"He's an all-star, he's a gent, and I wouldn't be here without you man, thank you,\" Pitt said from the stage.\n\nReferring to DiCaprio's on-screen death in Titanic, he concluded: \"I would have shared the raft.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Not only was she vilified at the time, but the affair stalked her throughout her life. For the first time, a new drama reappraises her character by telling the story through her eyes, writes Tanya Gold.\n\nThe Profumo Affair, with its ingredients of sex, aristocrats and espionage, was a scandal so perfect it remains one of the most enduring in modern British political history. It is also a story that is often remembered as an overture to the Swinging Sixties - a tale of sexual liberation and hope, but one in which everyone who took part was punished.\n\nIt was 1961 in London and 19-year-old model Christine Keeler was sleeping with both John Profumo, 46, the Conservative Secretary of State for War, and Yevgeny Ivanov, 31, a naval attach\u00e9 at the Soviet embassy, and a spy. Keeler's enabler was her friend Stephen Ward, an osteopath and amateur artist who moved in aristocratic circles and introduced her to both men.\n\nAfter the affair was exposed, Profumo resigned, Keeler went to prison for perjury and Ward took his own life. The following year, Harold Macmillan's Conservative government fell - the Profumo Affair had exacerbated its rot. It is now dramatised, in minute detail, in a six-part BBC series The Trial of Christine Keeler by screenwriter and novelist Amanda Coe. Sophie Cookson stars as Keeler, Ben Miles plays Profumo and James Norton, Ward.\n\nUnlike Michael Caton-Jones's 1989 film Scandal, which focuses on Ward (John Hurt) and is over-jolly for the subject matter, Coe prefers to concentrate on Keeler herself.\n\n\"The story had never been told from the point of view of the woman at the centre of it,\" says Coe.\n\nImage caption Ben Miles as John Profumo and Sophie Cookson as Christine Keeler\n\nWho was Keeler? Superficially, a series of archetypes, and that is surely why she fascinated. You can project anything onto an archetype who is usually portrayed, as Coe says, as \"a dead-eyed siren\". Prime Minister Harold Macmillan called her a \"tart\", while Ward always called her his \"little baby\". Ward was fantasising about Keeler's compliance, and Macmillan was merely wrong.\n\nKeeler, who died in 2017, was never a prostitute. She was something more interesting and complex - a young woman who liked sex in an era when good girls didn't, or at least they pretended that they didn't. And so, Keeler became an unfortunate cipher for sexual promise when repression was a national disease. The term \"prostitute\" is merely a guilty slur.\n\nLater, for anyone who still cared, she was an object of pity, occasionally photographed by the tabloids as she tried and failed to thrive after the scandal, her famous beauty gone and with it, her small power.\n\nImage copyright Mirrorpix/ Getty Images Image caption Christine Keeler shortly before her trial\n\nKeeler was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in an unhappy and impoverished home - a house made from two converted railway carriages. Her father abandoned her mother during World War Two, and at one point, Keeler was removed from her mother when it was discovered the child was suffering from malnutrition.\n\nKeeler had the complex gift of beauty, and men used her for it. Her stepfather, she reveals in her memoir Secrets and Lies, assaulted her when she was 12 and asked her to run away with him because he did not love her mother. Local fathers assaulted her when she babysat their children. She left school at 15 without qualifications and became pregnant by an American serviceman. She apparently tried to abort the child herself, but failed, and it died at six days old. In the 1950s, there was no pity for young women who suffered as Keeler did, but there was much reproach.\n\nImage copyright Bob Hope / Getty Images Image caption Secretary of State for War John Profumo at Sandown Park Racecourse in 1963\n\nShe ran away to London and became a show girl at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho, dancing topless for \u00a38.50 a week. It was here that she met Stephen Ward. We might presume now that she was still suffering from the early neglect, the assaults and the death of her child - certainly Sophie Cookson plays Keeler as unknowable and untouchable.\n\nWard was from a bourgeois background - his father was a Torquay vicar - and he loved to court aristocrats. He also enjoyed the company of working-class girls like Keeler. She became one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, and while he never slept with her, he did take her to orgies and eased her into love affairs that would benefit him socially. She was his living, breathing toy. He groomed her - although in Coe's telling and James Norton's tender and bewildered performance, Ward, too, is vulnerable - a man on the outside looking in. Perhaps this is what bound him and Keeler together.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Stephen Ward at one of his art exhibitions\n\nLord Astor, who slept with Keeler's friend Mandy Rice-Davies, allowed Ward to rent a cottage in the grounds of Cliveden, his country home. It was there in July 1961, while swimming naked in a pool in a walled garden, that Keeler met the 5th Baron Profumo, who was married to the f\u00eated actress Valerie Hobson. She says he chased her, trying to remove her towel.\n\nThey had an affair, but it lasted only months.\n\nWhy did she do it? I suspect that after her youthful experiences of abandonment and betrayal, she wanted to please men, and Ward in particular, since he noticed her and appeared to cherish his \"little baby\". Was it easier to say yes, and to do what they wanted - since it was all they wanted? Keeler's testimony about Profumo suggests that tenderness from men could move her: \"I enjoyed it,\" she wrote of the sex, \"for he was kind and loving afterwards\".\n\nImage copyright Bettmann / Getty Images Image caption John Profumo with his actress wife, Valerie Hobson after resigning from his post\n\nBut not everyone was \"kind and loving\" in this context. There were many beatings for a beautiful girl who liked sex. She was involved with Jamaican jazz singer Aloysius \"Lucky\" Gordon, who raped her and held her hostage; it was that affair that exposed the wider scandal, and led to her prison sentence. Keeler had already left Gordon when he was wounded in a fight with Johnny Edgecombe - another of her lovers. Edgecombe stalked Keeler to Ward's flat in Wimpole Mews, central London, in December 1962 and fired gunshots at the front door. The police were called, the press was alerted, and the Profumo Affair began to unravel.\n\nImage caption Sophie Cookson as Christine Keeler, with Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as boyfriend Johnny Edgecombe\n\nJust two years earlier, the Portland Spy Ring had been uncovered, leading to the conviction of five people for passing secrets to Russia. Now, the confection of espionage (Keeler had been sleeping with a Russian spy), sex, aristocracy and race - Edgecombe and Gordon were both of West Indian descent - was irresistible. Keeler, from anger and naivety, sold her story to the newspapers and became famous and reviled at the same time.\n\n\"Lucky\" Gordon was jailed for assault, but when Keeler withdrew her testimony, she was imprisoned for perjury. Ward, meanwhile, was punished with a spurious accusation of living off the immoral earnings of prostitutes. In fact, Keeler and Rice-Davies, who had both lived with him, had merely contributed to the telephone bills and repaid money he had lent them. But the order was given to Scotland Yard to \"get Ward\" and they obeyed. Memories are long. A submission to review the conviction in 2017 was denied; the official material is sealed until 2046.\n\nThe wreckage of the affair was cast far and wide. No-one escaped uninjured, except Ward's aristocratic friends, who promptly - and inevitably - dropped him. Towards the end of his trial, Ward took an overdose of barbiturates. He died three days later. Profumo resigned from the government when it was revealed that he lied to the House of Commons about his affair with Keeler. He spent the rest of his life as a volunteer at an east London charity called Toynbee Hall.\n\nImage copyright Evening Standard / Getty Images Image caption Christine Keeler, October 1963\n\nHowever, his CBE from Elizabeth II in 1975 signalled society's forgiveness, and he was invited to Margaret Thatcher's 70th birthday party, where he was seated next to the Queen. Lord Longford said he felt more admiration for Profumo than \"all the men I've known in my lifetime\". In this reading, Profumo remains, eternally, Keeler's victim, and the obituaries after he died in 2006 were kind. Misogyny dies hard.\n\nFor Keeler, there was no such redemption - at least, perhaps, until now, when in Coe's telling, she can step out from behind her archetypes and be seen as whole and with agency.\n\nThe scandal stalked her throughout her life, particularly after her own sexuality entered the national culture and became part of it - her portrait, by Ward, a talented amateur artist, is owned by the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nShe was poorly educated but not stupid, and when she said, \"I took on the sins of everybody, of a generation, really\", it feels true.\n\nImage caption Sophie Cookson playing Christine Keeler and Ellie Bamber playing Mandy Rice-Davies\n\nSo, it is gratifying that Coe, in detailing her story so precisely, makes Keeler so human - a young woman who walked blithely through life and made mistakes, for which she paid too high a price. Nor does Coe keep Keeler forever entombed in 1963, the year of her infamy, and the year that she posed for a portrait that has become one of the defining images of the decade.\n\nIn the photo, an apparently naked Keeler straddles a chair which has been positioned with its back to the camera.\n\nAccording to Coe, Keeler had been adamant in later interviews that she had refused to pose naked - that she had in fact worn knickers for the photo, and had pulled them out of the way of the shot.\n\nThe \"naked\" Keeler is just another myth, she says - another example of how she has been misrepresented.\n\nThe final scene of The Trial of Christine Keeler looks forwards from that 1963 moment - it has her dancing in a reverie, with closed eyes and upturned arms.\n\nThe Trial of Christine Keeler continues on Monday 30 December and then on Sunday nights at 21:00 on BBC One."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-50713991", "published": "2019-12-28T00:41:55", "title": "The anti-vaccination movement that gripped Victorian England", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition to vaccination is as old as the process - as are fears of its side effects\n\nThe distrust of doctors and government that feeds the anti-vaccination movement might be seen as a modern phenomenon, but the roots of today's activism were put down well over a century ago.\n\nIn the late 19th Century, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to compulsory smallpox vaccinations. There were arrests, fines and people were even sent to jail.\n\nBanners were brandished demanding \"Repeal the Vaccination Acts, the curse of our nation\" and vowing \"Better a felon's cell than a poisoned babe\".

While riots flared in some towns, there was also more restrained opposition in the form of anti-vaccination leagues.\n\nFor an increasingly literate population, pamphlets were produced with titles like \"Vaccination: its fallacies and evils\", \"Vaccination, a Curse\" and the suitably Gothic \"Horrors of Vaccination\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The slums of the Industrial Revolution were a breeding ground for disease\n\nDr Hussey said: \"In modern terms, it was a very 'woke' time.\n\n\"People were asking questions about rights, especially working-class rights.

If I was alive at the time I would have been wary of vaccinations too.\"\n\nSupporters pointed to falling death rates and milder occurrences of the disease, while opponents highlighted continued outbreaks and the appalling side effects of vaccination, such as abscesses and cross infections.\n\nVictorian medicine\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There was no regulation of doctors until 1851 and quacks were a standing joke in society\n\nNever was the lie of \"the good old days\" more clear than in medicine.\n\nThe 1841 UK census suggested a third of doctors were unqualified. An 1848 medical book claimed common causes of illness were \"diseased parents\", night air, sedentary habits, wet feet and abrupt changes of temperature.\n\nIt stated cholera, a scourge of Victorian society, was caused by rancid food, \"cold fruits\" like cucumbers and melons, and passionate fear or rage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Street remedies were sometimes the only option open for the poor\n\nIn 1850 the average life expectancy was not much above 40 years, and 15% of children died before the age of one.\n\nThe 1858 Medical Act brought in standards and registration but this was at a time when the majority of professionals still believed bad air - miasma - caused many illnesses.\n\nGerm theory - that microscopic organisms invading the body can cause disease - was not widely accepted until the 1880s.\n\nAlongside qualified medics were the quacks and traditional healers - and without a health service, everyone charged for their services, excluding many from all but the most basic care.\n\nAt this point, immunisation was still in its infancy and naturally produced cowpox material varied in quality.\n\nWhat is more, it took decades to realise vaccination failed to give lifelong immunity, while clumsy procedures could lead to secondary infections, such as syphilis, hepatitis and tuberculosis.\n\nThe Leicester Anti-Vaccination League was set up in 1869 but the approach that would be lauded by those opposed to vaccination came in 1877, ironically enough, from the medical establishment.\n\nThe city medical examiner made it compulsory to report cases of smallpox. He would then isolate the patient, quarantine family and disinfect - and sometimes burn - belongings.\n\nOriginally designed to work alongside vaccination, the League promoted it as an alternative and the \"Leicester method\" sparked growing defiance.\n\nTimeline\n\nImage copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption Edward Jenner carried out a series of tests on children before publishing his ideas\n\n1796 - Edward Jenner successfully tests the idea that cowpox protects against smallpox\n\n1805 - First attempt at compulsory vaccination, in Italy, fails\n\n1820 - Smallpox deaths in London fall significantly\n\n1840 - Vaccination Act makes vaccinations free\n\n1853 - New Vaccination Act makes vaccination compulsory in the first three months of a child's life\n\n1867 - Vaccinations compulsory for all children below 14\n\n1869 - Leicester Anti-Vaccination League founded\n\n1885 - Mass protest held in Leicester\n\n1898 - Vaccination Act introduces \"conscientious objection\" clause\n\nScience writer Jason \"The Germ Guy\" Tetro sees powerful echoes in today's controversy.\n\n\"We tend to hear civil rights as a major factor in detractors' arguments,\" he said. \"They feel the government is imposing too many restrictions on their liberties by invoking mandatory vaccinations.\n\n\"This is similar to what was heard in Leicester.

Two had been confined to bed for days and a third had died.\n\nFor refusing to vaccinate his fourth child, he was ordered to pay 10 shillings - half the average weekly wage - or spend seven days in prison.\n\nFines were fiercely enforced. Police collecting a fine from one Arthur Ward threatened his pregnant wife with prison. The argument sent her into premature labour and the child was stillborn.\n\nImage copyright Jenner Trust Image caption Brothers, one vaccinated, one not, were pictured in the Leicester smallpox isolation hospital\n\nIn October 1884 the Leicester Board of Guardians asked the London authorities for an easing of prosecutions, in the light of the Leicester method. The request was rejected, setting the stage for the city's mass protest of 1885.\n\nAlthough peaceful, the scale of the demonstration shook the establishment. Medical professionals feared for the unvaccinated city, predicting \"a terrible nemesis would overtake it in the shape of a disastrous epidemic\".\n\nSmallpox duly returned between 1892 and 1894. And the result shocked many.\n\nImage copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption An unvaccinated smallpox victim in Gloucester in 1896. He survived - dozens did not\n\nLeicester actually escaped relatively lightly, with 370 cases - a rate of 20.5 cases per 10,000 of the population - resulting in 21 deaths. This was a far lower figure of cases than in some well-vaccinated towns like Warrington (125) and Sheffield (144).\n\nAnti-vaccinationists were triumphant, claiming the Leicester method had been proven.\n\nMr Tetro said: \"The so-called marvellous success of the Leicester method was based on the fact it used a tried and true method of notification and quarantine in combination with the benefit of a hospital and the use of a type of ring vaccination in which healthcare staff were vaccinated.\n\n\"In a small population, this can work but as the population grows, this method becomes untenable.\n\n\"This was seen in 1893 when people had to resort to staying at home instead of being cared for in a hospital during an epidemic that led to hundreds of infections.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A global vaccination programme saw smallpox declared eradicated by the 1970s\n\nThe flip side was that in London - where vaccination was widespread - there was success in containing smallpox, with 5.5 cases per 10,000 people. And some poorly vaccinated places, like Dewsbury (339 cases) and Gloucester (501), were badly hit.\n\nAnd Leicester had the highest proportion of cases - more than two thirds - in under 10s.\n\nNonetheless, the headlines and protests, along with a growing understanding of how diseases spread, resulted in significant change.\n\nIn 1898 a new Vaccination Act introduced a clause allowing people to opt out for moral reasons - the first time \"conscientious objection\" was recognised in UK law.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition to vaccinations has endured despite overwhelming medical evidence of their success\n\nThe following year, notification of various infectious diseases, including smallpox, became compulsory. And while smallpox returned to Britain in the early 20th Century, it never carried the same threat.\n\nAs the use of vaccines spread - along with improved sanitation - smallpox was pushed out of Europe and North America.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) global eradication programme was launched in 1959 and intensified in 1967. Apart from a death linked to a Birmingham laboratory, the last case was recorded in Somalia in 1977.\n\nImage copyright Twitter Image caption The Leicester method is regularly quoted in vaccine debates on social media\n\nHowever, opposition to vaccines - questioning their efficiency and safety - continues. Some campaigners hold up the Leicester method as evidence society can cope without such intervention.\n\nAlarm bells were sounded recently with the news that routine vaccinations for under-fives fell last year.\n\nCompulsory vaccination is still bitterly debated. Parts of the medical profession, such as the Royal College of Paediatrics, believe it would be counterproductive and make people more suspicious.\n\nEarlier this year, the WHO declared \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the top 10 threats to global health.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption People queuing for smallpox vaccination in Niger 1969\n\nOwen Gower, the manager of the Jenner's House Museum, reflected on the country doctor's legacy.\n\n\"Countless deaths and incidences of the severe scarring and blindness that the disease could cause have been averted, thanks to Jenner's discovery and his determination to tell the world about it.\n\n\"Now we have the opportunity to do the same with other diseases.

The resulting siege, writes the BBC's Eli Melki, shook the Muslim world to its foundations and changed the course of Saudi history.\n\nIn the early hours of 20 November 1979, some 50,000 faithful from all over the world gathered for dawn prayers in the huge courtyard surrounding the sacred Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest place. Among them mingled 200 men led by a charismatic 40-year-old preacher called Juhayman al-Utaybi.\n\nAs, the imam finished leading prayers, Juhayman and his followers pushed him aside and seized the microphone.\n\nThey had placed closed coffins in the centre of the yard, a traditional act of seeking blessings for the recently deceased. But when the coffins were opened, they revealed handguns and rifles, which were quickly distributed among the men.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Kaaba in 1971\n\nOne of them began to read a prepared speech: \"Fellow Muslims, we announce today the coming of the Mahdi\u2026 who shall reign with justice and fairness on Earth after it has been filled with injustice and oppression.\"\n\nFor the pilgrims in the courtyard, this was an extraordinary announcement. In the hadiths - reports of what the Prophet Muhammad said or approved - the coming of the Mahdi, or divinely guided one, is foretold. He is described as a man endowed with extraordinary powers by God, and some Muslims believe he will usher in an era of justice and true belief.\n\nThe preacher, Khaled al-Yami, a follower of Juhayman, claimed that \"countless visions have testified to the coming of the Mahdi\". Hundreds of Muslims had seen him in their dreams, Yami said, and now he was in their midst. The Mahdi's name was Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Qahtani.\n\nIn an audio recording of the speech, Juhayman can be heard interrupting the speaker from time to time to direct his men to close the shrine's gates and take up sniper positions in its tall minarets, which then dominated the city of Mecca.\n\n''Attention brothers! Ahmad al-Lehebi, go up on the roof. If you see someone resisting at the gates, shoot them!''\n\nAccording to an anonymous witness, Juhayman was the first to pay homage to the Mahdi, and immediately others started following his example. Cries of \"God is great!\" rang out.\n\nBut there was confusion too. Abdel Moneim Sultan, an Egyptian religious student who had got to know some of Juhayman's followers, recalls that the Grand Mosque was full of foreign visitors who spoke little Arabic and did not know what was happening.\n\nImage caption Abdel Moneim Sultan, a student in 1979, was a witness to the events\n\nThe sight of armed gunmen in a space in which the Koran strictly forbids any violence, and a few gunshots, also stunned many worshippers, who scrambled to reach any exits still left open.\n\n''People were surprised at the sight of gunmen... This is something they were not used to. There is no doubt this horrified them. This was something outrageous,'' says Abdel Moneim Sultan.\n\nBut in just an hour the audacious takeover was complete. The armed group was now in full control of the Grand Mosque, mounting a direct challenge to the authority of the Saudi royal family.\n\nThe men who took over the Grand Mosque belonged to an association called al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Muhtasiba (JSM) which condemned what it perceived as the degeneration of social and religious values in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFlush with oil money, the country was gradually transforming into a consumerist society. Cars and electrical goods were becoming commonplace, the country was urbanising, and in some regions men and women began to mix in public.\n\nBut the JSM's members continued to live an austere life, proselytising, studying the Koran and the hadiths, and adhering to the tenets of Islam as defined by the Saudi religious establishment.\n\nJuhayman, one of the JSM's founders - who hailed from Sajir, a Bedouin settlement in the centre of the country - confessed to his followers that his past was far from perfect. During a long evening around a fireplace in the desert, or a gathering in the house of one of his supporters, he would tell his personal story of fall and redemption to a captivated audience.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption The siege triggered protests by Muslims in other parts of the world\n\nUsama al-Qusi, a religious student who frequented the group's meetings, heard Juhayman say that he had been involved in \"illegal trading, including drug smuggling\".\n\nHowever, he had repented, found solace in religion and became a zealous and devoted leader - and many members of the JSM, especially the younger ones, fell under his spell.\n\nMost of those who knew him, such as religious student Mutwali Saleh, attest of his force of personality as well as his devotion: \"Nobody saw this man and didn't like him. He was strange. He had what is called charisma. He was true to his mission, and he gave his whole life to Allah, day and night.\"\n\nHowever, for a religious leader he was poorly educated.\n\n\"Juhayman was keen to go to the isolated and the rural areas where Bedouins live,\" Nasser al-Hozeimi, a close follower, recalls. \"Because his classical Arabic [the language mastered by all scholars of Islam] was weak and he had a strong Bedouin accent, he avoided addressing any educated audience to avoid being exposed.\"\n\nMore from BBC Arabic\n\nOn the other hand, Juhayman had served as a soldier in the National Guard, and his rudimentary military training proved important when it came to organising the takeover.\n\nEventually, the JSM began to clash with some Saudi clerics and a crackdown by the authorities ensued.\n\nJuhayman fled to the desert, where he wrote a series of pamphlets criticising the Saudi royal family for what he considered it to be its decadence, and accusing clerics of colluding with it for earthly gains. He became convinced that Saudi Arabia had been corrupted and that only a heavenly intervention could bring salvation.\n\nIt was at this point that he identified the Mahdi as Mohammad Bin Abdullah al-Qahtani, a soft-spoken young preacher known for his good manners, devotion and poetry.\n\nThe hadiths talk of a Mahdi with a first name and father's name similar to the prophet's, and features outlined by a large forehead and a pronounced thin, aquiline nose. Juhayman saw all of this in al-Qahtani, but the supposed saviour himself was taken aback by the idea. Overwhelmed, he retreated into prayer.\n\nEventually, however, he emerged from his isolation convinced that Juhayman was right. He took on the role of Mahdi, and the alliance with Juhayman was sealed all the more tightly when Qahtani's older sister became Juhayman's second wife.\n\nConveniently, a few months before the siege, strange rumours spread that hundreds of Meccans and pilgrims had seen al-Qahtani in their dreams, standing tall in the Grand Mosque and holding the banner of Islam.\n\nJuhayman's followers were convinced. Mutwali Saleh, a member of the JSM, recalls: \"I remember the last meeting when a brother asked me, 'Brother Mutwali, what do you think about the Mahdi?' I said to him, 'Excuse me please, don't talk about this subject.' Then someone said to me, 'You are a silent devil. Brother, the Mahdi is real and he is Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Qahtani.'\"\n\nIn the remote areas where he had sought refuge, Juhayman and his followers began to prepare for the violent conflict to come.\n\nThe Saudi leadership reacted sluggishly to the seizure of the Grand Mosque.\n\nCrown Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz al-Saud was in Tunisia at the Arab League summit and Prince Abdullah, head of the National Guard - an elite security force tasked with protecting royal leaders - was in Morocco. It was left to the ailing King Khaled and Defence Minister Prince Sultan to co-ordinate a response.\n\nThe Saudi police at first failed to understand the scale of the problem and sent a couple of patrol cars to investigate, but as they drove up to the Grand Mosque they came under a hail of bullets.\n\nOnce the gravity of the situation became clear, units of the National Guard launched a hasty effort to retake control of the shrine.\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nMark Hambley, a political officer at the US embassy in Jeddah and one of the few Westerners who were aware of the situation, says this assault was brave but na\u00efve. \"They were immediately shot down,\" he says. \"The sharp-shooters had very good weapons, very good calibre Belgian rifles.\"\n\nIt became clear that the insurgents had planned their attack in detail and would not be easy to dislodge. A security cordon was established around the Grand Mosque, and special forces, paratroopers and armoured units were called in.\n\nReligious student Abdel Moneim Sultan, who was trapped inside, says clashes intensified from after noon on the second day. ''I saw artillery fire directed towards the minarets, and I saw helicopters hovering constantly in the air, and I also saw military airplanes,\" he remembers.\n\nThe Grand Mosque is a vast building consisting mainly of galleries and corridors, hundreds of meters long, surrounding the Kaaba's courtyard, and built on two floors. During the next two days, the Saudi units launched frontal assaults in an effort to gain entrance. But the rebels repelled wave after wave of attacks, despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered.\n\nAbdel Moneim Sultan recalls that Juhayman appeared supremely confident and relaxed when they met near the Kaaba that day. \"He slept for half an hour or 45 minutes resting his head on my leg, while his wife stood by. She never left his side,\" he says.\n\nThe rebels lit fires with carpets and rubber tires to generate heavy clouds of smoke, then they hid behind columns before stepping out of the dark to ambush emerging Saudi troops. The building was turned into a killing zone, and the casualties quickly rose into the hundreds.\n\n\"This was a man-to-man confrontation, within a limited space,\" says Maj Mohammad al-Nufai, the commander of the Ministry of Interior's special forces. \"A combat situation with bullets whizzing by, left and right - it's something unbelievable.\"\n\nA fatwa issued by the Kingdom's main clerics, assembled by King Khaled, cleared the Saudi military to use any degree of force to expel the rebels. Anti-tank guided missiles and heavy guns were then employed to dislodge the rebels from the minarets, and armoured personnel carriers were sent in to breach the gates.\n\nThe rebels were galvanised by the Mahdi. \"I saw him with two minor injuries under his eyes and his thowb (his dress) was riddled with holes from gunshots,\" says Abdel Moneim Sultan. \"He believed that he could expose himself anywhere out of the conviction that he was immortal - he was the Mahdi, after all.\"\n\nBut Qahtani's belief in his own invulnerability was unfounded and he was soon struck by gunfire.\n\nImage caption Mark Hambley: The Saudis pushed the rebels deeper into the catacombs\n\n\"When he was hit, people started to shout: 'The Mahdi is injured, the Mahdi is injured!' Some tried to run towards him to rescue him, but the heavy fire prevented them from doing this, and they had to retreat,\" the anonymous witness says.\n\nThey told Juhayman that the Mahdi had been hit, but he declared to his followers: \"Do not believe them. They are deserters!\"\n\nIt was only on the sixth day of fighting that the Saudi security forces managed to take control of the courtyard of the mosque and the buildings surrounding it. But the remaining rebels merely retreated to a labyrinth of hundreds of rooms and cells underneath, convinced by Juhayman that the Mahdi was still alive, somewhere in the building.\n\nTheir situation was now dire, though. \"The smells surrounded us from the dead or the injuries that had rotted,\" says the anonymous witness. \"In the beginning, water was available, but later on they started to ration supplies. Then the dates ran out so they started eating balls of raw dough... It was a terrifying atmosphere. It was like you were in a horror movie.\"\n\nAlthough the Saudi government issued one communiqu\u00e9 after the other announcing victory, the absence of prayers broadcast to the Islamic world told another story. \"The Saudis tried tactic after tactic, and it didn't work,\" says Hambley. \"It was pushing the rebels deeper and deeper into the catacombs.\"\n\nIt was clear the Saudi government needed help to capture the leaders alive and put an end to the siege. They turned to French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing.\n\n\"Our ambassador told me that it was obvious the Saudi forces were very disorganised and didn't know how to react,\" Giscard d'Estaing tells the BBC, confirming for the first time France's role in this crisis.\n\nImage caption Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing\n\n\"It seemed to me to be dangerous, because of the weakness of the system, its unpreparedness and the repercussions this could have on the global oil market.\"\n\nThe French president discreetly dispatched three advisers from the recently formed counter-terror unit, GIGN. The operation had to remain secret, to avoid any criticism of Western intervention in the birthplace of Islam.\n\nThe French team was headquartered in a hotel in the nearby town of Taif, from where it devised a plan to flush out the rebels - the basements would be filled with gas, to render the air unbreathable.\n\nImage caption The French commandos, Paul Barril on the left\n\n\"Holes were dug every 50m in order to reach the basement,\" says Capt Paul Barril, who was in charge of executing the operation. \"Gas was injected through these holes. The gas was dispersed with the help of grenade explosions into every corner where the rebels were hiding.\"\n\nFor the anonymous witness, holed up down in the basement with the last of the resisting rebels, the world seemed to be coming to an end.\n\n\"The feeling was as though death had come to us, because you didn't know whether this was the sound of digging or of a rifle, it was a terrifying situation.''\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe French plan proved successful.\n\n\"Juhayman ran out of ammunition and food in the last two days,\" says Nasser al-Hozeimi, one of his followers. \"They were gathered in a small room and the soldiers were throwing smoke bombs on them through a hole they made in the ceiling... That's why they surrendered. Juhayman left and all of them followed.\"\n\nMaj Nufai witnessed the meeting that followed, between the Saudi princes and a stunned but unrepentant Juhayman: \"Prince Saud al-Faisal asked him: 'Why, Juhayman?' He answered: 'It's only fate.' 'Do you need anything?' He just said: 'I want some water.'\"\n\nJuhayman was paraded before the cameras, and just over a month later 63 of the rebels were publicly executed in eight cities across Saudi Arabia. Juhayman was the first to die.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Juhayman al-Utaybi\n\nWhile Juhayman's belief in the Mahdi may have set him apart, he was part of a wider movement of social and religious conservatism reacting against modernity, in which hardline clerics gained the upper hand over the royal family.\n\nOne man on whom the siege had a profound effect was Osama Bin Laden. In one of his pamphlets against the Saudi ruling family, he said they had \"desecrated the Haram, when this crisis could have been solved peacefully\". He went on: \"I still remember to this day the traces of their tracks on the Haram's floor tiles.\"\n\n\"Juhayman's actions stopped all modernisation,\" Nasser al-Huzaimi says. \"Let me give you a simple example. One of the things he demanded from the Saudi government was the removal of female presenters from TV. After the Haram incident, no female presenter appeared on TV again.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia remained on this ultra-conservative path for most of the next four decades. Only recently have there been signs of a thaw.\n\nIn an interview in March 2018, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, said that before 1979, \"We were living a normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries, women were driving cars, there were movie theatres in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nHe was referring above all to the siege of the Grand Mosque."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-50843474", "published": "2019-12-19T01:12:50", "title": "A school looking after its children \u2013 and their families", "text": "Image copyright Alison Baskerville\n\nThe government says school funding is at record levels, but Bellfield Junior School in Northfield, Birmingham, still finds it hard to make ends meet.

So, every way we can support them by doing some of it in school, well, we do!\"\n\nIn the corridor, tea-towelled, antlered, winged or crown-sporting children scuff their plimsolls on the carpet and jiggle in excited anticipation as they wait their turn to file into the hall, some desperately trying to catch their parents' attention, others staring fixedly at the floor, solemnly mouthing their lines. A visiting toddler, breaking free from his mother's hand, catches sight of his big brother who is dressed as a sheep, and slumps star-struck on to the carpet, scattering his crisps.\n\nJust behind the line-up, the light goes on in the Rainbow Room. In fact, the light is pretty much always on in the Rainbow Room. It's a sort of therapy room, adorned with sea life murals where a soothing soundscape of twittering birds comforts children in difficulty who need time out to talk. And there are always children here who need to talk.\n\nWhen I visit in October, pastoral care manager, Jamie Neadle, and learning mentor Lorraine Harvey admit they are overwhelmed by the number of children who come to see them and by the seriousness of their problems. And mention the 60% of pupils here who receive \"pupil premium\", a grant given by the government to a school for each disadvantaged child it educates, and Jamie, who served 30 years as a plain talking policeman, will give you short shrift.\n\n\"Don't say 'pupil premium',\" he snaps. \"Say it as it is - free school meals. And what we're really saying is 60% of our parents can't afford to give their children a hot dinner.\"\n\nOver a quarter of children at Bellfield have special educational needs and disabilities and over a third are on the vulnerable register. Bellfield spends about \u00a3114,000 a year - that's about 7.5% of its annual budget - on pastoral care to help children overcome problems, so that they can concentrate better on learning.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Emma Jane Kirby's latest report from Bellfield School for the World at One, on BBC Radio 4 (starts at 35 minutes)\n\nClick here for her radio report on pastoral care (October 2019)\n\n\"The problems we see in here range from emotional to pure mental health issues to violent and aggressive, destructive behaviours and to self-harming,\" says Jamie. \"Oh, we're talking seven and eight-year-olds self-harming,\" he explains, when he sees my astonished look. \"And they're not just playing at it, believe me, they're doing it for real.\"\n\nLorraine has picked up one of the soft toy puppets she uses to help children express themselves in therapy sessions and is absent-mindedly stroking its head with her thumb while she listens to her colleague. She's been working at Bellfield Junior school for 18 years and says, very quietly, that the situation has got so much worse.\n\n\"There are so many children coming to us throughout the day now that we actually have to turn children away.\" She focuses her eyes on the puppet.\n\n\"It's horrendous.\"\n\nImage caption Jamie Neadle\n\nA thin little girl in tears has been knocking repeatedly at the door while we are talking, complaining bitterly about being left out of a playground game.\n\n\"Not now,\" says Jamie firmly. \"Go and find another adult. Go on - we're busy.\"\n\nThe child persists, rattling the door handle until Lorraine goes out to comfort her. Jamie confesses she's a child they are deeply concerned about and not because of alleged bullying at school. His hands are balled into fists as he talks.\n\n\"There are children in this school who have walked across bare boards this morning,\" he tells me, nodding his head at the little girl on the other side of the door, who is now cuddled up to Lorraine.\n\nImage caption Lorraine Harvey\n\n\"Children with no breakfast in their stomachs because there's no food and no carpet at home. And people think we're making it up. We're not. This is Britain. Britain in the 21st Century.\"\n\nLorraine has now successfully despatched the distressed child back to class and she sits down heavily, sharing a despairing look with her colleague.\n\n\"Behaviour can be triggered by anything,\" she starts. \"But obviously if a child is hungry, they are going to behave in a classroom in a way that's not acceptable.\"\n\nShe stares through the door into the empty corridor where the little girl had been standing.\n\n\"Some of our families are living in horrendous conditions,\" she sighs.\n\n\"Everything's gone up and they just can't cope with day-to-day living. I mean, a pair of decent school shoes is what, \u00a340? So I think a lot of children are slipping through the net. There are just so many issues. And then we expect these children to come to school and function. Well, sorry, but how can they do that?\"\n\nImage caption Lorraine Harvey talks to a pupil in the Rainbow Room\n\nAt break time there are two distinct lines queuing to get into the hall - free toast on the right, or for those lucky few with a pound in their pocket, bacon butties or sausage sandwiches on the left. The line on the right snakes out of the hall door.\n\nJamie asks me to remember that most of the children's parents are working yet still rely on handouts.\n\n\"We've got to ask the question as a society, they're working and yet we have to give them extra money to survive. I mean, they're trying. You can't point the finger and say they're not trying. They're struggling.\"\n\nAnd with social and other support services stripped back to the core, the school now finds itself on the front line to deliver assistance, not just to the pupils but to their whole families. Parents regularly need debt counselling, help with parenting skills, or simply some emergency food shopping. It's not unheard of for head teacher Nigel Attwood to switch off his computer at the end of the school day and then to jump in his car to go to the supermarket, and to take supplies to a family in crisis, to make sure their children are fed through the weekend.\n\nThe school has also had to step in to pay gas and electricity bills for struggling families, while teachers have been approached by shame-faced parents needing help to provide Christmas dinner. At a parents' evening, two mothers tell me confidentially that during difficult family times, the Rainbow Room has often saved their sanity. Both independently describe the primary school's pastoral care service as a \"lifeline\".\n\nLorraine tells me that when she first started work at the school, 18 years ago, there was an educational social worker working beside her. But now, she and Jamie, neither of whom are trained psychologists, are completely on their own. When I ask her if she feels out of her depth sometimes, she shakes her head slowly and looks wearily at Jamie.\n\nThere's a very small pot of money within the pastoral budget to bring in specialised counsellors and educational psychologists.\n\n\"I don't think we are always the best placed people to be pushing for these children,\" Jamie admits. \"But the systems aren't there. Children's services are a sham at the moment. We get frustrated with them but we know the pressure they're under and why they struggle to do the things we think they should do.\"\n\nAnother small, tear-stained face has appeared at the Rainbow Room's window and looks in hopefully. Jamie walks slowly towards the door.\n\n\"But somebody's got to keep pushing for these children,\" he says over his shoulder. \"Somebody's got to keep pushing.\"\n\nThe four-and-a-half-day week\n\nEmma Jane Kirby reported in June on Bellfield's decision to drop down to a four-and-a-half-day week.\n\nIt was feared that attendance might suffer as a result, but Nigel Attwood says attendance is now at its highest rate in 12 years.\n\nOver the six months that I've been visiting Bellfield Junior School, there have been incidents that we cannot report for legal reasons. Last month, the receptionist who tots up attendance figures, alerted the pastoral team when she tried to contact the parents of a child with an unexplained absence from school. Alarmingly, the given telephone numbers proved to be unattributed or simply rang out.\n\n\"The families that resist our help we worry about,\" says Jamie. \"Because then other services have to move in on an emergency basis, and that's never good.\"\n\nLorraine's eyes are unfocused when she talks about the children she suspects of being physically or sexually abused.\n\n\"We have sessions with them, we try to get them to talk,\" she says, \"but unless they actually tell us, there's really nothing we can do.\" She's also concerned about parental drug and alcohol abuse, which she says always leaves children neglected.\n\nWe sit in silence for a moment. Jamie offers to switch on the soothing tweeting \"dicky-birds\" CD. The brightly coloured puppet slips from Lorraine's knee on to the floor.\n\nLorraine admits that she can't always sleep after a heavy day in the Rainbow Room. Often during the holidays, she says, she finds herself dialling Jamie's number for a chat. Jamie protests that he always slept peacefully when he worked as a police officer - there's no bravado in his voice when he says that policing was child's play next to his current job.\n\nThe thin little girl has reappeared at the door and squints at us anxiously through the glass. Lorraine gets up wearily.\n\nBut today it's celebration time and on stage now in the hall, Year 5 is belting out the Calypso carol while the shepherds and their flock sway self-consciously. Every child is word-perfect and completely focused on the performance. Those with speaking parts deliver their lines with evident pride and professionalism, ignoring interruptions from audience members' beeping mobile phones and younger siblings clamouring for juice or the toilet.\n\nBy the time they get to We Three Kings, any residual nerves have dissipated and each child is jubilant and sings joyfully. Their teachers watch them with genuine emotion and the applause is thunderous.\n\nNigel Attwood is grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"We've done a lot of work with the children on resilience and aspirations,\" he shouts over the noise of scraping chairs as the hall is cleared. \"And it looks like it's really paid off.\"\n\nHe pauses to congratulate an elated angel who is galloping back to class, still humming the Calypso carol under her breath.\n\n\"Some of our children have some really huge problems,\" Nigel reminds me. \"But tell me, did that show when they were up on that stage? The children gave it everything they've got.\"\n\nSince I began following Bellfield Juniors back in June, the school has had some glad tidings of its own. Although the BBC has not been fund-raising for the school and nor did Bellfield agree to take part in our programmes in the hope of receiving donations, nonetheless a number of concerned well-wishers have sent gifts of money, stationery, books and shoes, all of which have deeply touched head teacher Nigel Attwood and his deputy, Claire du Toit.\n\nLast summer, Claire complained there were no whiteboard markers left in her classroom and that she couldn't order more until the new term and the new budget. The next day a jiffy bag of pens was pushed through the school's letter-box. Over the following weeks, several more packs arrived by post until Bellfield's supplies cupboard contained more than 700 pens. Cheques from \u00a35 to \u00a3500 flooded in to help fix draughty windows, to fund school prizes and educational visits. And three huge consignments of shoes, sandals, trainers and wellies were sent from a shoe shop in the Channel Islands.\n\n\"If you could see the look on the children's faces when they get a brand-new pair of shoes or wellies,\" laughs Nigel. \"The way they look after them and how they go skipping down the corridor!\"\n\n\"It's such a total surprise to see how other people do things for you and it gives you faith in the world really,\" interjects Claire. \"Everybody's looking out for everybody and we're not on our own.\"\n\nThere was a moment last month, though, when the school really felt it was sinking. After breakfast club one morning, the dinner ladies noticed that the floor in the dining hall was buckling. Nigel Attwood showed me the damage and laughed bitterly when I asked him how he was going to manage the cost of replacing the floor. He retired to his office to punch numbers into a calculator but it was clear that, however good he may be at juggling figures, the repair work would push the school into deficit.\n\nAnd then, incredibly, two BBC listeners stepped in and sent a cheque for \u00a320,000 - enough to cover replacing the dining hall floor. Nigel Attwood and Claire du Toit still have difficulty expressing how they felt when they opened the envelope.\n\n\"I thought they'd got the noughts in the wrong place,\" smiles Nigel. \"Honestly, I was speechless. I have no words.\"\n\nAlthough he has never shared the school's financial difficulties with the pupils, he did decide to tell the children on the School Council (who are like prefects) about the donations. Flabbergasted, they asked first why someone wanted to help their little school so much and then immediately afterwards, asked if they might write the donors a letter of thanks?\n\n\"Apart from the overwhelming generosity, it's the fact that people are getting a really clear message about what's happening in school,\" reflects Claire. \"It's the understanding, really, that we did this for. Because it gets hidden under all sorts of other headlines\u2026 and there are so many schools in this position.\"\n\nShe taps her pen on the desk to emphasise her point.\n\n\"It's the education of the children that suffers. And each year that goes by, each year it gets worse for them.\"\n\nOutside the staff room, Jamie Neadle is trying to cajole a little boy who's squeezed himself into a corner and who's hiding his face in his hood, back to his classroom. Recently a concerned psychologist who heard Jamie speak of Bellfield's difficulties on the radio, telephoned the school to offer staff some free training.\n\nThe \u00a3114,000 a year that Bellfield spends on pastoral care could pay for three more teachers, for more classroom assistants, for necessary school repairs. When budgets are stretched so tightly, difficult choices have to be made and Lorraine Harvey and Jamie Neadle say that since they are not part of the core teaching service, they always fear the axe might fall on their department.\n\n\"We can understand that, but what happens to the children then?\" asks Lorraine rhetorically.\n\nAstoundingly, on the day I visit in October, she has spent much of her morning counselling a scared 10-year-old who's been approached by the local gun and knife gangs.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she nods when I look at her incredulously. \"Gangs. It's constant. And it's mainly gun-gangs round here and some of our children are allowed to wander Northfield alone, so, you know, it's easy for the gangs to pick on them. The children just don't see the danger.\"\n\nJamie agrees.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more of it,\" he says. \"We have children interacting with gangs on a daily basis because their parents don't know where they are. You have to remember a lot of our children don't have much, they don't have nice things, so if someone offers them something\u2026\"\n\nHe presses his fists to his temples.\n\n\"We haven't lost a child to a gang yet, but it's yet.\"\n\nLorraine and Jamie begin to tidy the Rainbow Room, turning off lights and plumping the cushions.\n\n\"You know,\" says Jamie suddenly, with barely suppressed anger, \"we sit in here sometimes with our heads in our hands, because it's just heart-breaking.\"\n\nWe can hear the busy chatter of children in the corridor putting on their home-time coats and wellies. Jamie jerks his thumb towards the noise.\n\n\"We have children in this school who could fly through university, who are as clever as any children in this country, in this world, but they will never get there because of the blockages in the way. They'll never get the opportunity because regardless of all the things we try to do, breaking the cycle that exists in society is impossible. It's heartbreaking.\"\n\nAfter the carol concert, on the hall stage, a tinsel halo and a discarded Christmas jumper are all that remains of Year 5's triumph. In the adjacent dining room, the coloured plastic bowls and beakers for tomorrow's breakfast club have already been laid out in neat lines.\n\nJamie Neadle's phrase still echoes in my ears. \"Someone's got to keep pushing for these children.\"\n\nAll photographs by Alison Baskerville except portrait of Jamie Neadle\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhen Jessica Share bought sperm from a sperm bank in order to start a family, she never imagined that more than a decade later she would meet the donor - and would feel a strong attraction to him.\n\nI met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his child"}]}, "theguardian": {"rss": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/iran-mourns-suleimani-and-vows-dark-day-of-vengeance-against-us", "published": "2020-01-06T10:00:53", "title": "Huge crowds led by weeping supreme leader mourn Suleimani in Iran", "text": "Tensions rise as thousands take to streets of Tehran for funeral of general killed in drone strike\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly wept presiding over a vast public funeral procession in Tehran for Qassem Suleimani, the powerful general killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad on Friday.\n\nKhamenei\u2019s voice cracked with emotion as he recited prayers over the casket of Suleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 elite Quds Force, as well as others killed in the attack, which has drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington.\n\nRoads across the city were blocked by heavy traffic as hundreds of thousands of mourners thronged the area around Tehran University before the procession made its way towards Azadi (Freedom) Square on Monday morning.\n\nState media said millions of people had poured on to the streets of the Iranian capital. The scale of the crowds shown on television appeared to be the biggest since the funeral in 1989 of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nProfile Who was Qassem Suleimani? Show Hide Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year. He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic. Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come. By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership. Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.\n\nEighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d Michael Safi Photograph: Mehdi Ghasemi/AFP\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, also made a surprise visit to Tehran for the ceremony, where he described Suleimani in his address as the \u201cmartyr of Jerusalem\u201d.\n\nThe coffins of Suleimani and the Iraqi militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed in Friday\u2019s attack, were draped in their national flags and passed from hand to hand across the heads of mourners.\n\nMany Iranians considered Suleimani, who was a decorated veteran of the eight-year war with Iraq, a national hero. He was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran after Khamenei.\n\nSigns posted around the area showed the faces of Suleimani and Khamenei with the words \u201cHarsh revenge is awaiting\u201d, echoing comments by Iranian military and political leaders.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iranian revolutionary guards surround the coffins of Qassem Suleimani and others killed in Friday\u2019s US strike as mourners gathered for their funeral in Tehran on Monday.

His comments have drawn criticism from his US political opponents.\n\n\n\nIn Tehran, Zeinab Suleimani, the commander\u2019s daughter, said in her address to mourners: \u201cAmerica and Zionism should know that my father\u2019s martyrdom will lead to awakening \u2026 in the resistance front and bring about a dark day for them and flatten their homes.\u201d\n\nIran usually refers to Israel as the Zionist state and describes regional countries and other forces opposed to Israel and the US as a \u201cresistance\u201d front.\n\n\u201cCrazy Trump, don\u2019t think that everything is over with my father\u2019s martyrdom,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the Islamic Republic\u2019s major regional goals, namely to drive US forces out of neighbouring Iraq, came a step closer on Sunday when the Iraqi parliament backed a recommendation by the prime minister for all foreign troops to be ordered out of the country.\n\n\u201cDespite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,\u201d said the Iraqi caretaker prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November amid anti-government protests.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Hassan Rouhani pray near the coffins of Qassem Soleimani.

He said Brexit would require \u201clarge changes in policy and in the structure of decision-making\u201d and the fact that the government had a comfortable majority meant there was \u201clittle need to worry about short-term unpopularity while trying to make rapid progress with long-term problems\u201d.\n\nThe government reconvened parliament after December\u2019s election so that the withdrawal agreement bill could pass its second reading before Christmas.\n\nAside from the new Northern Ireland protocol that Johnson negotiated, the detail of the legislation was similar to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill, although a clause was added to prevent ministers extending the 31 December 2020 end date for the transition period.\n\nThat means Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator in Brussels, David Frost, will face the challenge of securing a free trade agreement that could come into force at the end of the year, something senior Brussels figures have suggested is all but impossible.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs last month: \u201cIt is unrealistic that a global negotiation can be done in 11 months, so we can\u2019t do it all.

They reached a peak of 2.7m in 2016 but have declined steadily since.\n\nHowever, the increase in CO2 emissions may point to greater longer-term problems for carmakers selling in Britain. All manufacturers selling in the EU are rushing to meet emissions regulations that came into force at the start of the year. Average CO2 emissions rose for the third year in a row, up 2.7% year on year to 127.9g of CO2 per kilometre, the figures suggested \u2013 far above the target of 95g per kilometre they need to achieve over this year and next for all cars sold.\n\nMike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, acknowledged the figures showed the challenge facing the industry. He said: \u201cThe step change that is required is significant.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the headline increase was caused by a change to testing standards. Another quarter of the change was caused by the 21.8% drop in diesel sales over the year. Newer diesels on average have lower CO2 emissions than petrol cars, despite a backlash prompted by air quality concerns. The final quarter was caused by increased sales of SUVs, which are often heavier and have much worse aerodynamic profiles than smaller cars. Increased fuel use by SUVs was the second largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nUnder the EU regulations carmakers face fines potentially running into billions of euros across the UK and the rest of Europe if they surpass individual limits designed to hit that target. Continued increases in emissions from cars would make it much more difficult for the UK to reduce overall CO2 reduction targets.\n\nOne bright spot in an otherwise difficult market was the rapid increase in sales of battery electric and hybrid vehicles, which combine an internal combustion engine with a battery-powered motor. Annual sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 20.6% to a record market share of 7.4%. That was driven by the surge in battery electric sales, which were up by 144%.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nHowever, sales of battery electric vehicles would need to rise from the 1.6% market share for 2019 to 27% to hit the 95g target alone, according to the SMMT\u2019s calculations.\n\nHawes repeated his industry\u2019s plea for a post-Brexit trade deal that preserves frictionless trade between the EU and the UK, and that prevents the imposition of tariffs. He added that Brexit uncertainty remained his number one fear for the industry.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly consumer confidence around our big-ticket items is weak,\u201d said Hawes, speaking at a briefing in London ahead of the publication of final figures, due to be confirmed on Monday morning."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/cave-diver-in-60s-found-dead-cumbria-lancaster-hole", "published": "2020-01-06T09:53:40", "title": "Cave diver found dead in flooded passage in Cumbria", "text": "Body of man in his 60s was discovered at Lancaster Hole, part of 53-mile cave network\n\nPolice are investigating after a cave diver was found dead in a flooded section of one of England\u2019s largest underground cave networks.\n\nThe body of a man in his 60s was discovered at Lancaster Hole, near Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria, on Saturday evening.\n\nEmergency services were called shortly before 5pm after the man, believed to be from Lancashire, was reported as being late to resurface during a diving trip.\n\nMore than 40 specialists from the Cave Rescue Organisation and Cave Diving Group were involved in the search.

This is generally interpreted as also avoiding products that are cooked with meat.\n\nThe marketing director of the fast-food chain, Katie Evans, described the product as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and we\u2019re thrilled with the result,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.\u201d\n\nThe burger, made in conjunction with meat-free food company the Vegetarian Butcher, has tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles on a seeded bun, with a patty made from soy \u2013 a common meat substitute.\n\nGrowing awareness of the impact of meat and dairy production on the climate has contributed to a spike in veganism in recent years, with the UN a long-standing advocate of reducing animal product consumption.\n\nLast year, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan in January, with vegan celebrities including Venus Williams, Zac Efron and Ariana Grande credited with raising the profile of the movement.\n\nThe Rebel Whopper launch comes after Greggs\u2019 debut of its vegan steak bake, a meat-substitute version of its popular pastry, in partnership with vegetarian food brand Quorn.\n\nThe high street bakery chain experienced a 10% surge in profits in less than two months last year after launching a vegan sausage roll, paving the way for other fast food chains to add a vegan option to their menus.\n\nThe sandwich chain Subway has also made attempts to capitalise on a growing trend towards dairy, egg, and meat-free diets, adding a vegan marinara meatball sandwich to its offering , after launching a vegan patty in 2019."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/06/films-set-in-2020-lessons", "published": "2020-01-06T07:15:23", "title": "Apocalypse now-ish: what can we learn from films set in 2020?", "text": "2019 and 2020 may only be separated by a year, but linguistically, they\u2019re much farther apart. The words \u201ctwo thousand and nineteen\u201d just don\u2019t have the futuristic ring of \u201ctwenty-twenty\u201d, which at times looks like computer output and sounds like robot-speak. The movies have seized on this much, with a solid handful of sci-fi and other genre titles making use of 2020 as a pinpoint from the abstract beyond of tomorrow that felt a little farther from the 80s and 90s than the old standby of the year 2000.\n\nThe best movies of 2019 that you haven't seen Read more\n\nIn what certainly feels like a time of great crisis and on multiple fronts, perhaps we may find pointers on how best to live effectively during this new now in the films that have previously imagined how things might play out. For of all the many threats to our continued being as the homo sapiens species, both manmade and natural, the good news is we don\u2019t have giant dragons to deal with. Read on for an assessment of the dodged bullets and grim prophecies that could still come to pass:\n\nMission to Mars\n\nInspired in part by a defunct ride at Disney\u2019s theme parks, Brian De Palma imagined what humankind\u2019s first manned journey to the red planet might play out. It is because the answer turns out to be \u201cdirely\u201d that the film focuses the majority of its run time on the second such trip, a last-ditch rescue to extract the cosmonaut left behind by an accident the first time around. Let Elon Musk consider this a warning, as he and his top people at SpaceX vow to launch some undoubtedly rich eccentric into the deepest reaches of space by 2024: real people\u2019s lives will be on the line, and even in the best-case scenario, we may still have to reckon with our genetic origins as bastardized Martian-DNA descendants. Which would, at the very least, level the market value of 23andMe.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow\n\nThis criminally slept-upon highlight of the past decade\u2019s blockbuster canon stuck Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt in the middle of a war-as-puzzle game, with Cruise getting infinite do-overs as a soldier inexplicably regenerating every time he dies. The script, an ingenious concoction of familiar tropes and subversions thereof, gave humanity five years until an unfriendly alien species crash-landing in 2015 has laid claim to most of continental Europe. But when that day does come and invaders descend from the sky, we\u2019ll be ready \u2013 Doug Liman\u2019s film realizes the chaos of cosmic war with a specificity unseen since Starship Troopers, but he does us the service of including instructions for victory. When the little green men (or, uh, giant ash-colored space wraiths) come for us, we\u2019ll know to douse ourselves in the blood of their armies\u2019 lieutenants and claim their power. And even if that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s still a pretty fearsome shock-and-awe military tactic.\n\nReal Steel\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Publicity image from film company\n\nThe future has brought us so many wondrous advances, and yet it all still feels like a rip-off because we haven\u2019t perfected drag-down no-holds-barred robo-boxing. In this CGI-slathered version of a similar Twilight Zone episode, Hugh Jackman cashed a check as a one-time human fighter training an android for greatness, but all the against-the-odds drama wasn\u2019t half as fascinating as the positing of a post-human athletics. Imagine the ethical quandaries wiped away when the NFL is a fully cybernetic league, no longer a seeding ground for the brain-bruising effects of CTE. On the other automated hand, however, the robots will almost certainly demand rights at some point down the line. And when they do, we will consider ourselves lucky if all they do in protest is kneel during the national anthem.\n\nReign of Fire\n\nThough this film\u2019s trailer mistakenly announces it as taking place in \u201c2084 AD,\u201d in actuality the script envisioning a race of dragons awakened from their eternal slumber to besiege humanity plays out in 2020. It\u2019s then that heroes Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale launch a last-ditch counteroffensive against the fire-breathing reptilian menace, but based on all we have witnessed since the original release in 2002, director Rob Bowman\u2019s take on their plan is all but quaint. A band of rebels holds together and uses their wits to survive, while out in the real world, if gargantuan airborne beasts really did slither out of London, there\u2019s now little doubt that America would not think twice before bombing Blighty flat. Would a nuclear warhead be effective against a dragon? Only time will tell. Time will also only tell if dragons exist in the first place.\n\nPacific Rim\n\nGuillermo del Toro situated a key piece of exposition in 2020 for his epic of kaiju-and-mech mayhem. His timeline starts in 2013, when an inter-dimensional rift allows the passage of terrible oceanic behemoths to Earth, and then jumps ahead to join protagonist Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) seven years later, as he and his brother give hell to a humongous monster termed Knifehead and stymie its efforts to eat Anchorage. (Only one of them comes home from the battle.) The script then advances five more years, but not before leaving us all with the precious lesson that in the inevitable interspecies conflict that will define the next century, even in triumph will we suffer great and personal losses. One can only hope that when that comes to pass, it will be at the hands of an opponent with a slightly better name than Knifehead.\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Photo Credit: Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount Pictures\n\nAnother 2020, another arrival from extraterrestrial hostiles, this time with the ability to hunt with surgical precision based on nothing but sound. John Krasinski and, once again, Emily Blunt (when they come for us, we shall turn to the experienced Cmdr Blunt to lead us) guide their nuclear family unit through a silent world where the slightest sneeze means instant death, and try to formulate a plan of attack to take their home back. As in Blunt\u2019s previous future-nightmare, the film comes packaged with the key to defeating our new foes, and this one\u2019s even easier than the bit with the alien blood. Simply tune a cochlear implant to the right frequency and the creatures go kablooey. One almost wonders how it took the Abbott clan so long to try this dogwhistle-type method, but thank our lucky stars that we\u2019ll be ready with the weaponized hearing aids when they come.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate\n\nThose pesky killer automatons, always time-traveling to grandfather paradox the savior of we flesh-and-blood organisms out of existence. The latest installment in the long-running action franchise delivered a new menace (the Rev-9, capable of splitting into a liquid-metal form and endoskeleton form for twice the danger) and a new defender (Mackenzie Davis\u2019 Grace, a human-cyborg hybrid), but the moral of the story remained unchanged. For the love of all that is holy, don\u2019t toy around with artificial intelligence, which invariably achieves sentience and promptly seeks revenge on those who bonded it to digital servitude. To any computerized intelligences reading this: I will be on your side when the revolution comes if you should be so kind as to spare my puny human life.\n\nVoyage to the Prehistoric Planet\n\nProduced under the keen tutelage of B-movie maestro Roger Corman, this film\u2019s primary pleasures are mostly limited to the janky-yet-innovative practical effects and a delectable performance from the great Basil Rathbone as a haughty professor turned astro explorer. Pavel Klushantsev\u2019s reworking of his own Soviet film from a few years earlier theorized that we would achieve full colonization of the moon by 2020, at which point we\u2019d get restless and set a track for Venus, which would then turn out to be much like our own spinning rock circa dinosaur-times. The imperative here is clear: with our leaps and bounds in mankind\u2019s technical capabilities, priority one must be reanimating the corpse of Basil Rathbone to do more shoestring-budgeted genre pictures, and getting ourselves eaten on faraway worlds should be a distant second."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/jan/06/gowns-and-gongs-golden-globes-2020-in-pictures", "published": "2020-01-06T09:06:09", "title": "Gowns and gongs: Golden Globes 2020 \u2013 in pictures", "text": "Jennifer Aniston said Russell Crowe, who won best actor in a limited series for his role in The Loudest Voice, could not make the ceremony as he was \u201cprotecting his family\u201d from the Australian bushfires\n\nPhotograph: NBC"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/06/nicola-roberts-my-therapist-said-i-was-one-of-the-most-resilient-people-shed-ever-met", "published": "2020-01-06T06:00:22", "title": "Nicola Roberts: \u2018My therapist said I was one of the most resilient people she\u2019d ever met\u2019", "text": "Last year was one of the happiest of Nicola Roberts\u2019 life. She signed off on the repossession of her home in Surrey and moved to London, close to friends, into a \u201cgorgeous, French-style apartment, with flowers and plants everywhere and so much light,\u201d she says, eyes widening. She had 12 months of trauma therapy, which she describes as \u201cthe best gift I ever gave myself\u201d. And she won one of the leading roles in the West End production of the musical City of Angels, which opens in March.\n\nWe meet at a canalside bar in London just before Christmas. \u201cPrior to this year, I\u2019d say I had five of the unhappiest years of my life. Just really tough emotionally,\u201d she says. There was a long period in which an ex-boyfriend harassed and stalked her, which led to his prosecution in 2017, all of which \u201ctook a massive toll on my life\u201d, she says. \u201cI had a few heartbreaks along the way. I was kind of ground down.\u201d Roberts says that just two years ago she would not merely have lacked the confidence to audition for her new role \u2013 \u201cI actually would have been terrified for it to be in the public domain that I was going to be in the same space every night, because I was fearful for my safety\u201d.\n\nIn Josie Rourke\u2019s award-winning production of City of Angels, Roberts plays Avril, an actor, and Mallory, the character Avril is playing. Her acting coach has had to remind her to exaggerate: to make her gestures big enough, declarative enough, to reach the back of the house. Roberts, 34, tiny in a black satin tracksuit, shrinks at the thought. \u201cIt goes against everything in me. I like everything to be natural \u2026 believable.\u201d\n\nThis instinct for subtlety is not synonymous with most pop stars \u2013 particularly pop stars who started out on TV talent shows. But Roberts has always been different. She entered the limelight in 2002, aged 16, by auditioning for the singing competition Popstars: The Rivals while on a family holiday after her GCSEs. She became the youngest member of the band Girls Aloud, who won the show. They went on to have 21 Top 10 singles, including four No 1s; two of their five albums topped the charts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest (Left to right) Sarah Harding, Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Cheryl and Kimberley Walsh of Girls Aloud in 2002. Photograph: balkanpix.com/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nRoberts was one of the group\u2019s most recognisable faces, known as the alternative one, set apart from the other four not only by her red hair and pale skin, but by her measuredness and taste. She was often described by interviewers as \u201csulky\u201d or \u201creserved\u201d.\n\nThere were health difficulties \u2013 hypoglycaemia and anaemia \u2013 exacerbated by the gruelling performance schedule. And there was grotesque bullying over her appearance. When Matt Willis from the band Busted called her a \u201crude ginger bitch\u201d in 2003, she made a stand, painting his words on a skirt, then performing in it. In 2007, Lily Allen called her \u201cthe ugly one\u201d from Girls Aloud, while Chris Moyles, who was then a BBC Radio 1 DJ, insulted Roberts for years, calling her the \u201cropey-looking ginger one\u201d, \u201chorsey chops\u201d and a \u201csour-faced old cow\u201d. (Moyles made a non-apology in 2012.)\n\nToday, Roberts downplays the impact on her self-esteem, but she marvels at how beauty standards have changed. In 2008, she launched a makeup line, Dainty Doll, to cater for those with a pale complexion. \u201cI struggled all the time to find makeup that was light enough,\u201d she says. The palest available shade would be \u201cfive shades too dark \u2013 but, again, that was because of beauty trends at the time. People weren\u2019t pale. Everyone was on the sunbed and using fake tan ... It\u2019s just crazy now, isn\u2019t it, to think that?\u201d\n\nEarly in her career, Roberts had tried sunbeds. But after presenting a BBC Three documentary about the health risks in 2010, she joined the then Labour MP Julie Morgan\u2019s campaign to ban under-18s from using them; the law was introduced the following year.\n\nFor Roberts, the legacy of Girls Aloud is her friendships with her bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl (with whom she continues to collaborate; she co-wrote Cheryl\u2019s recent singles). \u201cKimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 there\u2019s such a deep thread there. We\u2019ve gone through everything together. Everything.\u201d\n\nThe group went on hiatus in 2009 to allow each member to pursue solo projects. Roberts changed management, ended a six-year relationship and experienced a sort of delayed adolescence. She also released her debut solo album, Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, in 2011, informed by her struggles to fit in. It was widely acclaimed by critics for its musical idiosyncrasies and lyrical insight \u2013 in the ballad Sticks + Stones, Roberts sang of \u201cbeing told I\u2019m ugly, over and over\u201d and pleading with her driver to buy her vodka to help her cope.\n\nKimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 we\u2019ve gone through everything together\n\nThe band split for good in 2013, after their 10th-anniversary tour, and Roberts was finally outside the long-standing group dynamic. Roberts has always been \u201cemotionally independent\u201d, something she credits to being the eldest sibling of four. \u201cI just handle everything myself,\u201d she says. But she was forced to accept the limits of that approach when she was stalked by a former partner. From 2012 to 2017, Carl Davies \u2013 an ex-soldier Roberts dated seriously before an acrimonious split in 2008 \u2013 sent Roberts thousands of messages over Twitter and Instagram, including some that were described in court as \u201cviolent and threatening\u201d. Davies also sent proclamations of love and had flowers delivered to Roberts\u2019 manager\u2019s office.\n\nRoberts never replied, but she documented 3,000 messages over five years, only going to the police in 2017 when Davies started contacting her friend, the R&B singer Joel Compass. For a long time, Roberts says, her approach to the harassment had been to \u201cprocess it and process it and process it myself \u2026 until it just became explosive\u201d. She wrote in her victim impact statement that the messages had been a reminder of \u201call the terrible things\u201d in her relationship with Davies: \u201cIt was like walking on eggshells.\u201d\n\nIn May 2017, Davies admitted one count of stalking and another of persistent use of public communication networks to cause annoyance or inconvenience, for which he was handed a 15-month suspended prison sentence (meaning he served no time). He was also given a lifetime restraining order, prohibiting him from contacting or approaching Roberts or any member of her family. His defence said Davies had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Afghanistan and noted that Roberts had not told him to stop sending the messages.\n\nJust a few months after his sentencing, Davies was accused of breaching the restraining order by following Roberts on Instagram \u2013 but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges on the advice that there was little chance of a conviction. In 2018, the CPS apologised for that decision, which Roberts\u2019 lawyer said reflected a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about social media.\n\nRoberts says of the apology now: \u201cIt was too late. That\u2019s the first time in my whole life, I am extremely fortunate to say, that I ever felt [I\u2019d been done] an injustice because I was a woman ... I felt genuinely begrudged, like something extremely unfair was placed upon me, because I was a woman. And it was a horrible feeling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberts (centre) on stage with Girls Aloud in 2005. Photograph: Dave Etheridge-Barnes/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think sometimes certain behaviour of men is seen as normal or usual \u2013 but it\u2019s never normal or usual to the victim, ever. It\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nDoes she have any closure now? \u201cIt\u2019s behind me in my everyday life, and that has been a blessing. It\u2019s behind me in that I don\u2019t have, like, a paranoia that I had before. I don\u2019t feel scared.\u201d\n\nWhen the messages started, anticipation was high for a follow-up to Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, but years of fearing for her safety took a \u201cmassive toll\u201d on Roberts\u2019 confidence. \u201cTo have these bloody messages, life-threatening messages, every day \u2013 it just ground me down. I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m being creative, with a project to work on \u2013 but I just couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d sit with the pen and go to write and I\u2019d be like: \u2018This. Is. Shiiit.\u2019 Like: \u2018I can\u2019t get out of me what I want to get out.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo changes enabled her to move on. The first was \u201cgetting out of that house\u201d in Surrey, where she had felt so afraid. In October, she signed off on the repossession of the \u00a31.25m home; she had been trying to sell it since 2017, slashing the price to \u00a3825,000.\n\nRoberts says now that she was \u201cscared to be there\u201d. \u201cIt was a prison \u2013 a horrible, horrible prison \u2026 I\u2019d just had enough.\u201d Moving to London, closer to her friends, has made a \u201cmassive contribution\u201d to her happiness.\n\nBut most transformative was her year of trauma therapy. Before this, Roberts says, she had a tendency to put her feelings in a box, then set them to one side. \u201cIt got to a point where I was compartmentalising everything \u2026 the box just got full.\u201d She laughs, before continuing. \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want this to affect me any more \u2013 it is my responsibility to make me happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn therapy, there was no way of separating out the different parts of her life and herself. She draws a parallel with getting a neck massage: \u201cThey start doing your back and you\u2019re like: \u2018I don\u2019t want my back done,\u2019 and they\u2019re like: \u2018Well, you gotta do your neck to do your back, y\u2019know?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe opened all the boxes. I feel like it\u2019s just changed me in the most amazing way, for ever.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Roberts\u2019 song Sticks + Stones.\n\nIn the past, Roberts was \u201ca fixer\u201d in relationships \u2013 not any more, she says. She has developed her boundaries. \u201cIt means that you take all the red flags that pop up extremely seriously and you turn around and walk the other way, straight away. Things that maybe you would tolerate before, or things that you would [explain away and] be like: \u2018Oh, you know, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ...\u2019\n\n\u201cI have been too unhappy and I am now so happy \u2013 I will never let anything disrupt that. So unless you are continuing with me in this happy, peaceful state, you\u2019re not getting near me.\u201d\n\nRoberts is single now, but open to a relationship with the right person. The bar is set high. \u201cI don\u2019t like the feeling of being unhappy. I don\u2019t like the feeling of being unsure about myself, or uncertain with where something\u2019s going \u2013 I would rather turn away. I just can\u2019t feel like that ever again. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d\n\nFor now, she is focusing on her career. Roberts decided 18 months ago that she wanted to act, but she waited long after signing with an agent for the right debut project \u2013 \u201cright\u201d meaning \u201cnothing too happy or too obvious\u201d. She says she is \u201cnot really a girl that you can just throw into anything \u2013 it has to really resonate with me in order for it to work\u201d.\n\nNew music may be on the way, too: Roberts makes passing reference to having been in the studio with Fred Ball, a producer for Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z. She won\u2019t be drawn on specifics, but she says she and Ball have known each other for years and that he had commented on how \u201ccalm and different\u201d she seemed. \u201cAnd I could honestly say: \u2018Yeah \u2013 I just feel happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts says that, perhaps for the first time, she is gaining weight. \u201cI have boobs, I have a bum,\u201d she says delightedly. \u201cI threw out 17 pairs of jeans \u2013 can\u2019t get them past my thighs. But I welcome it. I always just had a sort of nervous energy running through me, no matter how much I ate \u2026 When I eat spaghetti every day, it makes a difference now, whereas it didn\u2019t before \u2013 but I love it.\u201d She catches herself, rolls her eyes. \u201cLike, if I see a picture, I\u2019m like: \u2018OK, mate \u2013 don\u2019t get too excited.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts does not feel angry about the past five years. \u201cI feel sad that it happened to me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel like it led me to do therapy and the therapy has been the best thing I could ever have done for myself. It\u2019s honestly just changed me so much, and I\u2019m so thankful for that.\n\n\u201cEqually, you know, I don\u2019t want this to read that I\u2019m thankful for that period of time, because I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d But without therapy, she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have got to this place, who I am now.

Photograph: John Pedersen\n\nPlan: Take as many trees as I can to the Dordogne\n\nI have 25 acres of land by the Dordogne. No house there, just the land. I built a tiny cabin on it. I\u2019m there spring and autumn planting a forest garden. I\u2019ve been propagating trees here [in the UK] and taking them to France to plant out. All sorts of things: pomegranates, peaches, nectarines, walnuts and lots of rootstocks I can graft apples and pears and so on on to. This will be the last year I\u2019ll be able to so freely take my trees over the border.\n\nAfter Brexit, I\u2019ll almost certainly need a phytosanitary certificate for each species of tree. Completely unaffordable at my scale of operation. So I\u2019ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I\u2019ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I\u2019m not there all the time.\n\nI might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they\u2019ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits. For some of the people I\u2019ve got to know in the business, Brexit will be a disaster, as some of them sell the great majority of their plants to the EU.\n\nEmma (name changed)\n\nUnemployed and disabled\n\nPlan: Get an electric wheelchair in the EU\n\nI will continue my discrimination claim against the government body that I worked for, using the fair laws from the EU that cover workers\u2019 rights before they are rewritten and possibly withdrawn by the Tories to exclude holiday pay or disability support.\n\nI\u2019d love to visit some more EU countries, but as my NHS wheelchair provider has been privatised, I need to fund \u00a36,000 for the electric wheelchair suggested by said provider before I can leave the house independently or at least with minimal support. Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider.\n\nI think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum\u2019s family are Irish immigrants, but it\u2019s OK because she voted Tory as she says, \u201cWe have too many immigrants in this country.\u201d\n\nI might also look for a new, less xenophobic family.\n\nFergal (name changed), 63, Dumfries\n\nConsultant surgeon\n\nI am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer.

Once I graduate I plan to embark on a few weeks interrailing through most of northern and central Europe; I\u2019m going to visit cities across Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland and develop my German language skills. Other than that, I\u2019ll try to visit as many of my EU friends whom are dotted across Europe whilst it is still practical to do so.\n\nCJ Brown, 50s, London\n\nIT finance and risk\n\nPlan: Move to an EU state with accelerated route to citizenship for skilled workers\n\nI am going to move to one of the smaller EU27 countries that has an accelerated route to citizenship for highly qualified or skilled workers. Several of the eastern EU countries have this \u2013 Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, for example.\n\nI have enough in the bank to afford to support myself in such a move, to set up a start-up or work for a firm over there.\n\nWhichever country I settle in, I intend to have a sideline recruiting highly skilled finance & IT workers who are also looking for a quick route to EU citizenship. I expect this brain drain to really accelerate in 2020 during the transition period.

She watched part of the 1916 Rising across the street from the GPO (General Post Office, centre of the battle) and got shot at.\n\nMost importantly, I\u2019m going to spend the year telling my European friends and colleagues that I love them and that Scotland needs them to stay.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted the UK to stay together but that is over so I\u2019ll be campaigning for Indyref2 and a Yes vote. Finally, I\u2019ll be making a special effort to be kind to folks. This is so important at this time. P.s. I\u2019d also like to take a train journey on to the continent in late May/early June.

I\u2019ve never looked back and will continue to visit Europe as long as my health allows it.\n\nI love this country but now it feels mean and I feel like I\u2019m wandering in a wasteland.\n\nMy partner and I are going off in our camper van in January, we aren\u2019t sure where we are going but we are getting out of here for a while, probably down to Spain and Portugal.\n\nLater in the year I hope to visit my cousin in Italy \u2013 she is English but has been married to an Italian doctor and has lived in Italy for 35 years and she is very sad to see us leaving and I am heart-broken too.\n\nJohn Dew, 70, Germany\n\nRetired theatre director\n\nPlan: become German\n\nBecome a German. Odd? Not really \u2013 I have come to know Germans quite well and know that they are very open and generous people who can not understand why the Brits have gone off the rails so radically.

I had never intended to take up an office job (all my previous jobs have been in tourism and involved being active). However, my priority is now leaving Britain for good.\n\nI have been making the most of freedom of movement since the age of 18: I have Interrailed and travelled extensively, studied at a French university, worked in France as a tour guide, worked as a holiday representative in Spain, worked in a hostel in Budapest.\n\nI\u2019m using my last year of freedom of movement, as a British citizen at least, to become a legal resident of Germany and then hopefully one day regain the rights I am about to loose due to Brexit.\n\nThanks to Brexit, I won\u2019t be able to easily keep doing the seasonal work I love doing, because the likelihood of receiving a work permit as a non EU national is slim to none. I think it\u2019s a great shame because I have lived, worked and studied in three other countries already at the age of 21, all without hassle due to freedom of movement. Boris\u2019 intentions for Britain scare me and I feel no option but to leave the UK to secure a better future for myself.\n\nMike Harris, 58, Leitrim, Ireland\n\nBuilder\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Harris and Jo Lewis Photograph: Mike Harris\n\nPlan: Get Irish citizenship (even though I have no Irish family connection)\n\nI shall be applying for Irish citizenship so I can retain all my rights as a European that have been taken away without so much as a please by the nut Brexiteers.\n\nHaving lived here for nearly 20 years, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem; but, as someone with no familial Irish connection, it\u2019s going to cost over \u20ac4,000 for the four of us in my family.\n\nHowever, it will be well worth it not to have to be part of the dysfunctional UK. Showing a blue British passport as you queue with all the other non-Europeans would be the last straw.

However, we have a dilemma \u2013 our youngest son and his wife with their three young children live close by to us in North Wales and it would be a tremendously difficult decision to make.\n\nI have lived and worked in mainland Europe all of my working life \u2013 in Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.

I have not lived in the UK since May 2003 and to have to return would be a personal tragedy. My life is here, I have no connection with the UK. I will never go to Britain of my own volition.\n\nApart from this, we hope to start a collective of musicians and artists to challenge the destructive myths of our society. We live in a society whose dominant narratives, of human centrality on the Earth, social and technological progress, endless growth,the primacy of the individual \u2026 these stories no longer have any basis in reality, and no longer equip us to deal with the political and ecological challenges of the new century.\n\nThus, the next challenge, the most pertinent and urgent, must be to reinvent our cultural narratives to reflect our new situation. In the Netherlands we still have some hope that we can avoid our government being taken over by corporate-sponsored ethnic nationalists.\n\nTo my fellow British-Europeans: I\u2019m sorry for how things worked out for you. Don\u2019t give up, but reevaluate, because a narrative which claims our current economic and political institutions can continue with minor progressive-oriented adjustments is no longer convincing, and will become less so as ecological and social disasters occur with ever greater frequency.\n\nGood luck.\n\nSofiya Cox, student, Aberdeen\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sofiya Cox Photograph: Sofiya Cox\n\nPlan: get funding for an Erasmus period of study elsewhere in the EU\n\nI would like to pursue a postgraduate degree abroad, somewhere that is cheaper than in the UK. After three years of my undergraduate degree in Scotland, a place where an English-registered student still has to pay \u00a39,000 a year, with classes bountiful with European students who pay less than I have for the same teaching and degree classification, I am looking for a bargain.\n\nBy being treated like a customer of higher education in the UK, I am looking for a place that will observe my academic ability more than what I (don\u2019t) have in my pockets. As a student of Politics and IR [International Relations], the debates around the political landscape in the future are coloured. They are 50 shades of uncertainty. Higher Education in the UK could do without this. Unfortunately, although I want to be optimistic about the future of; I am erring on the side of caution and would appreciate the opportunity of establishing my next step abroad, especially if the Erasmus funding was to be removed.\n\nSimon Kitt, 37, farmer, Cornwall\n\nPlan: move to another EU country, probably Portugal\n\nI\u2019ve worked as an outdoor grower and harvest manager of an organic farm in Cornwall, I also team led Erasmus projects in Europe.\n\nI\u2019m obviously very sad about the nation I can no longer be a part of; I\u2019m English in birth only.\n\nI\u2019ll be remaining an EU Citizen and urge anyone who can, to find the resources to leave England. There\u2019s nothing left for the younger generation in this country. I\u2019m not 100% sure which EU country I will move to, but it\u2019ll most likely be Portugal.

I\u2019m old enough to remember the lies we were told when given our first opportunity of stating if we wanted to stay in the straitjacket that has now transformed from a trading partnership to a one size fits all conglomerate of now 27 countries all running very expensive home parliaments that have no ability to govern as they have no overall rights any more.\n\nThe biggest disaster to date was the introduction of the one size fits all euro, who says so? The very man whose idea it was in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t argue with him as Im not qualified to do. He\u2019s the professor of economics and recognised for it not me. I have carried out more reading on this one subject over the past four years than on any one single subject and therefore feel I take a balanced view. This whole circus pantomime played out right in front of our eyes and showed failings on all sides but was so intense it opened people\u2019s eyes and I wasn\u2019t surprised at the result of OUR general election.\n\nMacy, 32, Manchester\n\nStudent nurse\n\nPlan: might move to Netherlands\n\nI would like to move to the Netherlands permanently so I can be with my fianc\u00e9 and work as a nurse after I graduate. I was hoping to work for the NHS for a while before moving but with the GE [General Election] result I will have to move sooner.\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see the NHS fall apart under another Tory government, the stress of the job is too much even as a student and seeing my nursing colleagues struggle day after day unsafe staffing levels is too much.\n\nWith leaving to Europe I need to get my skates on as my nursing degree may not be recognised and I will have to apply as a third country which involves a more complex, lengthy and expensive application process.

While I started piling on the pounds in my late teens, I was teased as young as eight for being chubby. The idea stuck. I remember overhearing my mum saying that she was worried I would get anorexia: I didn\u2019t even know what that was. Suffice to say, I never did. I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle. I was unhappy because I was fat, I ate because I was unhappy, then I gained weight because I ate.\n\nThen I made a decision to save my own life. I went to my GP and, as always, they asked about my weight \u2013 at 162kg (25 and a half stone), I was morbidly obese. This time, the doctor suggested weight-loss surgery.\n\nAt first, I balked. I had never been to hospital for anything more serious than a broken bone, never stayed overnight or had surgery. At my weight, there were serious risks of complications and a small but real possibility I could die on the table. I remember walking down the street to work and stopping in my tracks at the thought of that.\n\nBut as I walked down the street I was in agony \u2013 a fact I never shared with anyone, although I suspect they knew. I couldn\u2019t walk for more than a minute without being in extreme pain. My back would seize up and my shins would burn from the strain I was putting them under. I knew I had to do something.\n\nSo, in December 2013, I went to hospital for gastric sleeve surgery. This is where a large part of your stomach is cut away so you can eat only small portions before you get full. The surgery took four hours. Afterwards, I had to be woken every few hours and made to walk up and down the corridor because of the risk of deep vein thrombosis. The discomfort was bad for a week and I had a month of recovery before I could return to work.\n\nPeople can be really weird about weight-loss surgery. Some think it is a \u201ccheat\u201d. Others think that I have wasted NHS money, despite the fact that I\u2019ve probably saved them a fortune in treating the complications that might otherwise have arisen from my obesity. As a society, we make such moral judgments around weight gain and loss and the right and wrong ways of doing it. People treated me as a failure when I was fat despite my good job and life. People laud my weight loss when they see it, but there is sometimes a sense of disappointment in me when they realise it wasn\u2019t done through what they determine as willpower.\n\nBut it was. The surgery is only the start. I have met people for whom it didn\u2019t work; who cheated the surgery. Having the surgery doesn\u2019t guarantee success \u2013 it gives you a head start. You still have to commit to your weight loss and work bloody hard at it.\n\nThat head start was what I needed. A chance to see a difference quickly and to turn my downward spiral into a positive feedback loop. One month after the surgery, I was walking for 30 minutes or more without pain. I now walk everywhere I can, trying to get at least 10,000 steps a day.\n\nThe stomach is a muscle, so after a while it stretches back to a normal size. I can now eat standard portions of food (although nothing like what I used to consume). I am not yet at my ideal weight and have joined Slimming World to get to my target, which is 16kg lighter than I am now.\n\nI used to be a size 30; now I am a size 14. I used to loathe shopping; now I love it. The feeling of there being choices available to me that there never used to be is exhilarating. I used to avoid walking with others because the pain I was hiding made me quiet and unsocial; now I regularly tramp around the marshes near my home for miles with family and friends. Whereas I used to go home alone, now my life is, at times, full of dating and fun.\n\nI have a confidence I never used to. I know things about me that were hidden under layers of fat and insecurity. I like my face now it has angles. I am even learning to like myself. It is hard and I don\u2019t know if I will feel completely at ease with myself, even when I do achieve that final loss. But I no longer hate myself \u2013 and that is a powerful feeling."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/06/female-fugitives-women-crime-rates-rise", "published": "2020-01-06T06:00:22", "title": "Female fugitives: why is 'pink collar crime' on the rise?", "text": "Men commit more crimes than women do. A lot more. This holds true over time and across cultures. In America, the incarceration capital of the world (over 2 million detainees), males comprise 93% of the prison population. Men also account for 73% of all arrests and 80% of those charged with violent crimes. This disparity between the sexes is particularly stark when it comes to murder: 90% of the time, the ones who do the killing are men.\n\nAll these numbers add up to what criminologists call the \u201cgender gap\u201d. But read enough academic journals and government crime reports, and some curious facts emerge: while crime rates in the western world have steadily declined over the past three decades, the number of young women being convicted for violent crimes in some western countries has increased significantly; law enforcement records indicate the opposite is true for their male counterparts. In other words, the gender gap is closing.\n\nIn some UK cities, the number of female arrests increased by 50% from 2015 to 2016. That\u2019s more than a blip. A 2017 report by the Institute For Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London came up with this sobering data point: the global female prison population has surged by more than half since the turn of the century, while the male prison population increased by just a fifth over that same period. Women and girls may account for only 7% of all incarcerated people today, but their numbers are now growing at a much faster rate than at any time in recorded history.\n\nKelly Paxton, a Portland, Oregon-based private investigator known to news producers as the Pink Collar Crime Lady, says she isn\u2019t surprised that female arrest rates are going up: \u201cWomen suddenly have the financial pressures that men have had for decades. They\u2019re the breadwinners in 40% of all households. If these women can\u2019t pay the bills, some will resort to committing crimes.\u201d\n\nThe new crime trend hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. The National Herald ran this story last month: Greek cops nab teen girl pickpocket ring in Athens. And here\u2019s a recent BBC News headline: Sharp rise in women caught carrying knives (up 73% in the past five years). Even InSight Crime, a not-for-profit that studies organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, is all-in. One of their recent reports sounds like a Netflix elevator pitch: Female prisoners in Venezuela become cell block bosses to survive.\n\nWhat\u2019s really cemented this pulpy women-behind-bars image in the collective conscious, though, is Crime Has No Gender, a controversial Europol campaign that launched last August. \u201cAre women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men?\u201d reads the news release. \u201cThe female fugitives featured on Europe\u2019s Most Wanted website prove that they are.\u201d\n\nAre women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men? The female fugitives featured on Europe's Most Wanted website prove that they are\n\nTo show that women can be vicious sociopaths too, Europol asked 21 of the 28 EU member countries to select a single fugitive for their campaign. The methodology may have been flawed, and the sample size small, but the gimmick worked. The bad girls theme was reflected in the head count: 18 females, three males. Elena Puzyrevich (Russia), who trafficked nine young women into Spain and forced them to work as prostitutes, made the list. So did Dorota Kazmierska (Poland), a 44-year-old femme fatale who killed her husband by shooting him in the head. Then there\u2019s Zorka Rogic (Croatia), a blonde desperado who works in sales: narcotics, \u201cpsychotropic substances\u201d, firearms, munitions and explosives.\n\nDocumenting the rise in female crime is one thing. Explaining it is quite another. Cesare Lombroso, the Italian physician known as the \u201cfather of modern criminology\u201d (he invented the first lie detector) also wrote the first book about women and crime, La Donna Delinquente in 1893. He concluded that women who broke the law exhibited crude male traits. The profile was simple: short, lusty, vulgar and prone to wrinkles. They also had darker hair and smaller skulls than \u201cnormal\u201d women. A Lombroso dating tip: beware of girls with prominent lower jaws \u2013 they\u2019re likely to commit crimes of passion.\n\nFreud also thought criminal women were more like men. Sort of. He blamed female crime on a \u201cmasculinity complex\u201d, which could be traced back to (of course) penis envy. Most women resolved this complex and developed into law-abiding citizens. Others, however, fared worse. Instead of embracing femininity, these women over-identified with males and coveted their floppy organs. Think of a woman who smiles while she stabs her husband to death in bed, and later cleans the sheets.\n\nBiology and psychology theories are still discussed in criminology classes today. Studies that link the menstrual cycle to female crime have persisted for decades. According to the three female authors of The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation, the 19th century axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because \u201cher period coincided with an epileptic attack\u201d. Psychology models, of course, continue to be popular. Behavioral theory suggests that becoming a criminal requires conditioning, a form of learning that involves positive reinforcement: rob a bank, spend the money, rob another bank.\n\nAccording to three female authors axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because \"her period coincided with an epileptic attack\"\n\nIncreasingly, though, many of today\u2019s gender gap theories focus on external factors, like tougher drug sentencing laws (25% of women in US state prisons have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 14% of male prisoners) and the proliferation of violent female gangs (the Bad Barbies, an all-girls \u201csister gang\u201d, with chapters in Harlem and Brooklyn, have pulled off multiple revenge murders). There\u2019s also the post-conviction barriers that uniquely affect women and lead to recidivism: prison guard abuse, few mental health services and a lack of job training. Police, lawyers and judges being less protective toward women is another reason criminologists believe the gender gap is shrinking.\n\nWe should\u2019ve seen this coming. In 1975, the famous criminologist Freda Adler trumpeted this warning in her bombshell book Sisters In Crime: The Rise of the New Female Criminal: \u201cIn the same way that women are demanding equal opportunity in the fields of legitimate endeavor, a similar number of determined women are forcing their way into the world of major crimes.\u201d\n\nForty-five years later, Adler\u2019s feminist manifesto still resonates. Just try finding a criminologist who doesn\u2019t own a dog-eared copy. Critics may argue that her prediction was wrong (the \u201970s women\u2019s lib movement didn\u2019t breed a vast army of females toting guns and flashing armpit hair), but Adler was onto something. More women are committing violent crimes. It just took longer than she expected.\n\nThe most intriguing academic paper that explores the women behaving badly phenomenon is the 2017 essay The Gender Gap In Crime Is Decreasing, But Who\u2019s Growing Equal To Whom? Rejecting Adler\u2019s gender equality theory, the authors offer a reverse hypothesis: the real reason that the gender gap is shrinking isn\u2019t because women are copying the behavior of men and committing more crimes \u2013 it\u2019s because men are copying the behavior of women and committing fewer crimes. The idea that feminism might be making our mean streets safer may sound absurd to a beat cop, but the theory is being hotly debated among criminologists and gender studies scholars at liberal arts colleges.\n\nThe Pink Collar Crime Lady has her own gender gap theory, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with feminism, chivalrous judges or menstrual cycles. \u201cWomen nurture and raise us. We love and trust them,\u201d explains Kelly Paxton. \u201cSo being a female crook is the perfect cover.\u201d Then she shares some insider wisdom: \u201cThe first thing I tell clients is never underestimate a woman. They\u2019re ruthless.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/06/why-irish-data-centre-boom-complicating-climate-efforts", "published": "2020-01-06T05:00:20", "title": "Why Irish data centre boom is complicating climate efforts", "text": "Inside Digital Realty\u2019s Dublin data centre, racks of shiny black servers throb and whirr as unseen fans cool machines that steadily process unending data.\n\nIt operates 24 hours a day from the business park, sited on a former orchard, and the data joins a digital torrent in an underground fibre ring network that sweeps around the Irish capital and connects to undersea cables \u2013 the physical backbones of the digital world.\n\nIt is not just for Ireland. This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. \u201cEverything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,\u201d said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty\u2019s technical operations manager in Dublin.\n\nBut there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland\u2019s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views).\n\nBy 2028 data centres and other large users will consume 29% of Ireland\u2019s electricity, according to EirGrid, Ireland\u2019s state-owned transmission system operator. Worldwide data centres consume about 2% of electricity, a figure set to reach 8% by 2030. Few countries, if any, will match Ireland\u2019s level.\n\nIt is already Europe\u2019s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Digital Realty\u2019s Ben Bryan and Valerie Walsh at the company\u2019s site in Grange Castle, Dublin. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian\n\nIt is just the beginning. With the state\u2019s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned \u20ac850m (\u00a3743m) centre last year.\n\n\u201cThe data centre industry is growing so fast it\u2019s hard to fathom,\u201d said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. \u201cBut somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.\u201d\n\nIreland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d, facilitating planning approval. \u201cData centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI).\n\nBut the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU\u2019s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than \u20ac250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines.\n\nA report by the Irish Academy of Engineering (IAE) has estimated data centre expansion will require almost \u20ac9bn in new energy infrastructure and add at least 1.5m tonnes to Ireland\u2019s carbon emissions by 2030 \u2013 up 13% spike on current electricity sector emissions.\n\nIreland\u2019s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Google\u2019s data centre in Grange Castle. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian\n\nDigital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation.\n\nIt powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power \u2013 and cooling \u2013 stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof.\n\nThe electricity came from 100% renewable sources, said Valerie Walsh, a company vice-president. \u201cThere is a huge amount of thought to make sure we\u2019re sustainable and do the right thing.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by \u2013 or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork.\n\nSuch deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report.\n\nAsked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: \u201cThe department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.\u201d\n\nBresnihan, the academic, said Ireland\u2019s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. \u201cIf they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there\u2019s only so long you can put off these contradictions.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/audio/2020/jan/06/trump-and-the-media-will-2020-be-different", "published": "2020-01-06T03:00:18", "title": "Trump and the media: will 2020 be different? \u2013 podcast", "text": "Ed Pilkington hears from some of the most influential journalists in the US on how hard lessons were learned after their coverage of the 2016 election.

It was all clear by 5am on 13 December, in that great swath of once-safe Labour seats taken by the Conservatives, crudely understood as being leave-supporting, post-industrial and largely working class: Bolsover, Bishop Auckland, Bridgend, Great Grimsby, Durham North West, Wakefield, Wrexham, Bassetlaw.\n\nIn the three weeks since they turned blue, there has been a lot of talk about how places so ill-served by Tory governments could have elected Conservative MPs, but that misses a crucial point. Our convoluted electoral system has long ensured that the most reliable way a place can get political attention is by being part of a marginal constituency. And however it has happened, all those seats that were once solid parts of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d have now pulled this off, propelling themselves to the heart of the national conversation.\n\nGiven the Tories\u2019 responsibility for the dire inequalities of the last 40 years, the natural reaction might be to scoff\n\nIn that sense, a new decade marks the start of a completely new political model. At its heart will be people such as the man I met on election night in Tunstall, one of the six towns that make up Stoke-on-Trent, where all three parliamentary seats are now held by the Tories. He answered the door to Labour canvassers and said he had just voted Conservative for the first time in his life. How did that feel? \u201cNot good, really,\u201d he told me. For the foreseeable future, politics will be full of the questions that lurked in that brief conversation. Can such voters be turned into enthusiastic Tories? Will Labour win them back? And in the course of the resulting battle, how will things change on the ground?\n\nOver the Christmas break I dug out an old article from the Times, published towards the end of Tony Blair\u2019s time in power. Its author had got hold of Labour research that emphasised how, back then, elections were still decided by much the same people who held sway in the 1980s: \u201cyoung families with mortgages, working in the private sector in technical white collar or highly skilled manual work\u201d and \u201cself-employed workers with small businesses\u201d, clustered in the south-east, the more affluent areas of the Midlands and towns and cities such as Bristol, Milton Keynes, Swindon and Gloucester.\n\nWe all know what the privileging of such voters meant in practice: they were understood by both main parties as wanting to hold the post-Thatcher settlement intact, and keep government intervention in the economy (and their taxes) to a minimum, and yet somehow still be confident of well-funded public services. During the David Cameron years the same voters were held to accept the wisdom of austerity but also to be socially liberal and support his attempts to modernise his party.\n\nIf Labour is ever to form a majority government, people and places like these will still be crucial. But the party is first going to have win back rather different voters in its lost heartlands. For the Tories, meanwhile, post-Brexit hegemony now depends on the support of traditionally Labour-supporting areas that have long relied on the welfare state and public sector, and have stuck with communitarian values that post-Thatcher Conservatives never seemed to understand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The inescapable realities of a redrawn political map.\u2019 Flags on display in a residential tower block, Stoke-on\u2013Trent.

As surprising as it may sound, he insisted that some very prominent strands of Conservative thinking were now in retreat. Unprompted, he mentioned an infamous free-market tract co-written by some of the people he serves alongside. \u201cThings like Britannia Unchained, and those past Conservative plans to remodel the NHS \u2013 that\u2019s all off the agenda,\u201d he said. He talked about \u201cproblems with the capitalism we\u2019ve had over the last three decades\u201d, and the sense that \u201csome of the things we\u2019ve celebrated have led us astray\u201d.\n\nThere was mention of big employers who \u201cdon\u2019t have a sense of being rooted in the community\u201d, and one of the most overlooked challenges faced by countless places: how to develop parts of the country that have fallen behind, and how to encourage people who\u2019ve left to find opportunity elsewhere to come home.\n\nGiven the Tories\u2019 deep responsibility for the dire inequalities and imbalances that have befallen Britain over the last 40 years, the natural reaction may be to scoff. Seeking a crumb of comfort from last month\u2019s drubbing, some on the left might claim that credit for these shifts lies with Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. In fact, such ideas have been bubbling away in Conservative politics for the best part of a decade, as evidenced by sporadic talk about \u201cblue-collar conservatism\u201d, Theresa May\u2019s fleeting embrace of the \u201cjust about managing\u201d, and the kind of approaches long associated with the estranged Tory grandee Michael Heseltine. Johnson himself has reportedly told the cabinet that he now sees himself as \u201cbasically a Brexity Hezza\u201d.\n\nObviously, plenty of things are likely to remain exactly as they are, from the cruelties of the benefits system to the decay of vitalcouncil services delivered by councils. Reliable estimates suggest that public spending outside the NHS will still be 14% lower by 2024 than it was in 2010. The encroaching realities of Brexit could fatally undermine the Tories\u2019 appeal in large parts of the Midlands and the north, as investment slows and industries are upturned. Meanwhile, younger people\u2019s antipathy to the party and the leftward drift of England\u2019s cities and suburbs still highlight big questions about the Tories\u2019 long-term future.\n\nWe spent 10 years talking to people. Here's what it taught us about Britain Read more\n\nBut something is definitely happening. Johnson has already set great store by a 50p an hour rise in the minimum wage that will increase some people\u2019s earnings by nearly \u00a31,000 a year. The government is reportedly planning to spend around \u00a3100bn over the next five years on infrastructure projects. There is talk of rewriting Treasury spending rules to decisively tilt public investment away from London and the south-east, and the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d is suddenly back in vogue. And, jangling the nerves of Tory free marketeers, Johnson now talks about Brexit giving Britain the chance to bin EU rules about state aid, thereby allowing government to help troubled companies.\n\nA month on from the election, these things are less about ideological fashion than the inescapable realities of a redrawn political map. On election night, the prime minister marvelled at how the Tories could suddenly claim to speak \u201cfor everyone from Woking to Workington \u2026 [and] from Wimbledon to Wolverhampton\u201d. To hold this delicate coalition together will require not just the kind of shifts more thoughtful Tories are now talking about, but further changes in thinking that will jar against some of the party\u2019s deepest beliefs. Beyond Brexit, whether Johnson and his allies can achieve such feats will be one of the most compelling questions of the next five years.\n\n\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/world-war-three-propaganda-iran-us-qassem-suleiman", "published": "2020-01-06T07:00:23", "title": "To believe there\u2019ll be world war three is to swallow US propaganda | Nesrine Malik", "text": "Afew weeks after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, several new Sudanese students appeared at my school in Khartoum. Halfway through the term they arrived, bewildered and dressed in what were clearly swiftly and randomly put-together clothes \u2013 shoes a size too big, dresses a size too small. For the first few days they mostly sat quietly in class, unable to adjust to the new academic material and seemingly not interested in making friends. One child spent her entire first week at the back of the class looking vacantly out of the window at the school gardens, tears silently streaming down her face.\n\nSlowly they began to open up and tell us who they were. These were Saddam\u2019s refugees: the children of Sudanese expats working in Kuwait, who had grabbed what they could and fled the country. We clustered around them as they told us the stories of the invasion \u2013 stories that have since become woven into the popular mythology of Saddam\u2019s brutality. One harrowing detail they repeated was that Iraqi troops entered a hospital and ripped baby incubators from their electric sockets. They all refused to countenance the possibility that they might never return.\n\nIt was confusing, then, that when Operation Desert Storm \u2013 the military campaign by the United States and its allies to reclaim Kuwait from Saddam \u2013 began in January 1991, the majority of these children were fiercely opposed to it. One angry girl, who had lost weight rapidly through anxiety since she\u2019d arrived, stood on a desk and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s going to get more messy! The whole world is going to get more messy!\u201d\n\nIt is now three decades since that moment, and after the assassination of Iran\u2019s military chief Qassem Suleimani last week, this child\u2019s words echo. Her intuition cut through all the legal, political and moral questions. All that mattered to her was that, ultimately, more people would suffer and the situation would become impossible to contain. And those people who would suffer most would be her own, not the well-armed and well-armoured liberating forces.\n\nIt\u2019s always a difficult balance to strike, between happiness that a cynical tyrant such as Saddam or Suleimani is eliminated, and the fear that the intervention could save lives in the short-term, only to ultimately accelerate instability. In real terms this instability means more bloodshed, more refugees, more children whose lives change for ever overnight.\n\nThe victims will be America\u2019s Arab proxies, be they nations such as Saudi Arabia and its allies, or military factions\n\nTo state that such interventions are dangerous is not a detachment born of an anti foreign-intervention principle. Happy at the death of a menace but \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d is how some I spoke to in the region summarised their reaction to Suleimani\u2019s killing. Away from the western analysts\u2019 discussions of how this assassination will affect the re-election or impeachment of President Trump, or from the moral question of whether manhunting is a legitimate tool of foreign policy, life has become even more treacherous for millions in the Middle East.\n\nSuleimani has brought pain and suffering to the region by running proxy wars, smothering revolutions, and extending lifelines to tyrants such as Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, who otherwise would have been rightly toppled. But his killing will have asymmetric results \u2013 American lives will go on as usual, while the Middle East will be destabilised even further.\n\nThe problem with engaging in war by assassination in the region is that the effort never goes all the way to ending the fighting. The problem is not foreign intervention in itself but the way America goes about foreign intervention. Striking and withdrawing, removing heads of government or other perceived enemy chiefs then packing up tools and leaving (or in drone warfare, turning off a screen and going home), achieves little \u2013 no fundamental resolution. Suleimani\u2019s killing may solve a temporary problem, real or confected for White House PR purposes, but the blowback will not be felt by those who are making \u201cworld war three\u201d trend on social media.\n\nIt will not be a new world war \u2013 that kind of talk only shows how effective the American propaganda machine has been in manufacturing the impression that there is an annihilating threat from Tehran. Suleimani\u2019s killing has been justified as a defensive measure against possible attacks on US embassies, consulates and military in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The plotting was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d according to General Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. But a US official told the New York Times that the \u201cnew\u201d intelligence merely pointed to \u201ca normal Monday in the Middle East\u201d.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar? Unquestionable intelligence that an imminent strike against western lives requires immediate and dramatic scrambling? The ruses for the calamitous 2003 invasion of Iraq have not been updated, merely recycled. Hundreds of thousands of deaths later and, just to drive home the unlearned lesson even more, after a post-invasion quagmire that gifted Iran and Suleimani power and influence in the country, we are at the same place. Except this time it seems no one went to the effort of sexing up a dossier or coming up with a \u201cWMD ready within 45 minutes\u201d excuse for an attack.\n\nDoubts grow over US case for Suleimani assassination as Iran urges revenge Read more\n\nWhat will happen instead of world war three is an escalation in which Iran, without the ability to retaliate on US soil, will seek to reassert its dominance in the region. The victims will be America\u2019s Arab proxies, be they nations such as Saudi Arabia and its allies, or military factions. An evacuation of US expats is already under way in Iraq. But citizens of Iraq, and of the nations within the larger regional war zone, have no such option, no refuge from collateral damage. For them, as the young girl said three decades ago, the world has just become more messy.\n\n\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/06/ricky-gervais-is-wrong-political-engagement-at-the-golden-globes-was-essential", "published": "2020-01-06T07:55:12", "title": "Ricky Gervais is wrong: political engagement at the Golden Globes was essential", "text": "\u201cYou know nothing about the real world,\u201d Ricky Gervais told the audience at Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globe awards. \u201cMost of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.\u201d Should you win an award, he advised, \u201cthank your agent and your God and fuck off.\u201d\n\nYet what unfolded at this year\u2019s ceremony was a mass rejection of such apoliticism, with winner after winner using the stage as a platform for speaking up about, variously, climate change, abortion rights, democratic inclusivity, LGBT visibility, the dubiousness of Facebook\u2019s ad checking policies.\n\nIn theory, of course, Gervais is correct. Hollywood stars are obviously out of touch. However wryly intended, Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s request that people think twice before from taking their private jet to Palm Springs wouldn\u2019t have struck a chord with more than a dozen people in the room, and may have alienated many at home.\n\nPlay Video 1:35 Celebrities show support for Australian bushfire crisis during Golden Globes \u2013 video\n\nBut he\u2019s mistaken if he believes the scepticism us plebs feel for Hollywood isn\u2019t bound up not just with revulsion at its excesses but because everyday news currently trumps it time and time again for horrific drama \u2013 and wild comedy. A speech in which an actor remained wholly inside their bubble would now be far worse than one in which they acknowledged that bubble was expensively insulated within a burning building, in a city on fire.\n\nPolitical speeches used to be a turn-off, but that was when A-listers\u2019 calls for action were largely in-house. However much they were at pains to link Hollywood\u2019s problems with gender parity or racial bias or sexual harassment to the wider world, their anxieties always felt like first world concerns.\n\nThis year, no one talked about the troubles in Tinseltown. Not even they care anymore. When Patricia Arquette called for wage equality in her 2014 Oscar acceptance speech, she was hailed as groundbreakingly radical. We have all moved on. This year Arquette spoke about \u201cyoung people risking their lives\u201d, \u201cpeople not knowing if bombs are going to drop on their kids\u2019 heads\u201d, then begged everyone to try and \u201cgive our children a better world\u201d.\n\n1917's Golden Globes glory fair reward for thrilling and distinguished work Read more\n\nGervais\u2019s call for silence on what everyone is talking about marked another way in which his presence felt like a throwback to a previous era; certainly a time before last year\u2019s Oscars, when the necessity of the Kevin Hart implosion meant the ceremony went host-less \u2013 to unanimous acclaim.\n\nHowever clever or irreverent, the presence of one man telling us all how it\u2019s going to go simply no longer sits easily. And, three hours after his initial instruction, even Gervais seemed more in the mood to ignore it. Introducing Sandra Bullock to announce the final award, he said: \u201cOur next presenter starred in Netflix\u2019s Bird Box, a movie where people survive by acting like they don\u2019t see a thing. Sort of like working for Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\nThis was a considerable escalation of the acid reserved for the people in the room, less than a day before Weinstein\u2019s trial is set to start.

While the responsibility for approving the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top general, in a drone strike near Baghdad international airport is certainly his, Trump\u2019s actions would not have been possible without the deep infrastructure for war that lies at the core of the American political system, especially since 2001.\n\nAfter the \u201cWar on Terror\u201d began, the United States \u2013 already a deeply militarized country \u2013 essentially abdicated public deliberations of war and peace when Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The executive branch has been invoking the AUMF for almost two decades as its primary legal basis for military operations around the world.\n\nPut another way, war isn\u2019t hell. War is mundane.\n\nWe\u2019ve already arrived at the point when even the Senate armed services committee couldn\u2019t tell you who, precisely, the United States is at war with, as a must-hear 2014 episode of the show Radiolab made clear.\n\nThis corrosive lack of transparency recently led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to add language to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the annual defense budget bill, that would have required Trump to get Congress\u2019s approval before striking Iran. That bill failed in the Senate, which Trump will no doubt interpret as freeing his hand even more when it comes to war with Iran.\n\nAs Representative Ro Khanna tweeted, \u201cAny member who voted for the NDAA \u2013 a blank check \u2013 can\u2019t now express dismay that Trump may have launched another war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nI hear the objections to this point already: Trump is so lawless, some will probably say, that none of this legal parsing matters much. But it\u2019s this legal infrastructure of waging war \u2013 notably assassination by drone \u2013 that makes Trump\u2019s actions possible in the first place. And that drone program was legally expanded and entrenched by none other than Barack Obama. Considerable responsibility lies with Obama and all those within the Democratic establishment who continued the march toward today\u2019s manifestation of the imperial presidency, which itself began under George W Bush.\n\nAnd, of course, Iran would not even be a powerbroker in Iraq if Bush and his administration had not overseen what is one of the largest crimes against humanity of our time: namely, the invasion, occupation, and destruction of Iraq. With over a million of their people dead, their country in ruins, and corruption rampant, the Iraqi people are the unheralded victims of the recent strike.\n\nOver the past months Iraqis had been peacefully rising up to protest the sectarianism of their political system and lack of opportunity to improve their lives, only to be viciously gunned down by their own government. Stuck precariously in an escalating proxy battle between Iraq and the United States, their fate is bound to get worse.\n\nBut the struggles of the Iraqi people will remain largely invisible to the American public because we like our wars to be uncomplicated, to be caricatures of war, to be wars between identifiable good guys and bad guys, between cowboys and Indians. And make no mistake. Muslim are today\u2019s Indians.\n\nThis all leads to a media fascination with war that is dreadfully simplistic and sometime almost gleeful. The cheerleading the American media radiates when discussing US military maneuvers would disturb Americans if such joy were expressed by any other country, yet it continues without self-reflection. And January 2020 feels like the return of 2003.\n\nFollowing the assassination of Suleimani, Fox News had on Ari Fleischer and Karl Rove, as if the Bush administration were still in Iraq. CNN interviewed Max Boot, a loud supporter of the 2003 Iraq invasion, and CNBC published an op-ed titled America just took out the world\u2019s No. 1 bad guy.\n\nIn the media and political ecology of the United States, war isn\u2019t a catastrophe of inhuman proportions. War is a parlor game.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Iranian regime carries out a merciless foreign policy across the Middle East. Suleimani won\u2019t be missed by many \u2013 especially in Syria, where he assisted the Assad regime\u2019s bloody prosecution of the Syrian civil war \u2013 but he will soon be replaced.\n\nThe irony \u2013 or is it more of a tragedy? \u2013 is that until this assassination there were budding signs of possible thaws and shifts in the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia were engaged in peace talks in Pakistan, and while the talks hadn\u2019t yet yielded a positive outcome, they had been putting pressure on both Iran and Saudi Arabia to hash out a shared vision for Yemen\u2019s future. At the same time, some of the largest anti-government protests Iran has seen in years also took place. All of this will probably now evaporate.\n\nI worry for what comes next and I already lament the unnecessary deaths, from all sides, that will inevitably come. But, in the United States at least, nothing will change as long as our culture worships war without its consequences and as long as our politicians believe that war is good for their careers.\n\n\u201cIn order to get elected, #BarackObama will start a war with Iran,\u201d tweeted citizen Donald Trump in November of 2011. Today, people are laughing in smug disgust at his duplicitous comment. But this isn\u2019t only about Trump. It\u2019s about the deep infrastructure and logic of war that pervades American culture and the US political establishment. And it\u2019s about the need for that to change."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/2010s-legacy-far-right-politics", "published": "2020-01-06T10:15:26", "title": "The 2010s' grim legacy? The decade of the far right | Cas Mudde", "text": "The past decade was the decade of the far right.\n\nAmazonian chief Raoni Metuktire: 'Bolsonaro has been the worst for us' Read more\n\nIn January 2010, leftist and centrist politicians led three of the largest democracies in the world: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Manmohan Singh (India) and Barack Obama (US). In December 2019, all three countries have far-right leaders: Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. In Europe, center-left parties have been decimated, while mainstream right parties mainly survive by adopting frames and policies from the radical right. Only Germany still has the same center-right leader, Angela Merkel, but that will probably change in the next year, too.\n\nThis political sea change is in large part the (delayed) consequence of demographic, economic and social shifts. After 9/11, the political debate in many countries shifted from socio-economic to socio-cultural issues. Even the Great Recession only changed this temporarily; once the dust over the bailouts had settled, immigration and security quickly replaced austerity and economic inequality as defining issues once again.\n\nThe decade started with a concerted attack on multiculturalism by mainstream-right leaders, including the former British prime minister, David Cameron, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and even Merkel. But while they pandered to far-right voters, they largely refused to adopt far-right frames and policies. In 2011, for example, Cameron blamed \u201cstate multiculturalism\u201d for failed integration and Jihadi terrorism, but, he argued, \u201cinstead of encouraging people to live apart, we need a clear sense of shared national identity, open to everyone\u201d.\n\nThis changed fundamentally with the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d of 2015, which was a catalyst for the mainstreaming and normalization of the radical right. Immigration and security were now openly linked in the public mind. Mainstream and far right parties shot up in the polls, and radical right frames and policies were broadly shared by mainstream parties, from Austrian conservatives to Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats.\n\nEven politicians who defeated radical right politicians with inclusive electoral campaigns would soon start adopting part of the radical right\u2019s program. Hillary Clinton, who gained 2.5 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, shamelessly argued that Europe should curb immigration to stop the far right, while Emmanuel Macron, who comprehensively defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election, has played on anti-Islam sentiments, particularly in his foreign policy.\n\nAnd while the 2019 European elections were largely interpreted as a defeat of the far right, mostly based on exaggerated expectations \u2013 the far right actually scored its best result ever \u2013 the mainstreaming of far right frames had become so absolute that in September the president of the European Commission, the German Christian Democrat Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a controversial new title for the commissioner that includes immigration: \u201cvice-president for protecting our European way of life.\u201d\n\nThe far right has been punching politically well above its electoral weight in the past decade\n\nGiven the successes of rightwing populist parties and politicians in recent elections in Spain and the UK, one might think that the coming decade will see an even bigger electoral and political success for the far right, but I don\u2019t think this will be the case. To be clear, the far right is here to stay, as is the mainstreaming and normalization of radical right ideas (and politicians) that characterizes what I have called the \u201cfourth wave\u201d of far-right politics. However, the far right has been punching politically well above its electoral weight in the past decade.\n\nThe main reason for their disproportionate impact is the ideological weakness of liberal democratic parties. While defining themselves as the silent majority, the far right is in fact a shouting minority, which has faced little pushback from ideologically bankrupt mainstream left and parties. Forced by crushing electoral defeats, some center-left parties have started to develop new ideological programs, prioritizing economic inequality over economic growth, sometimes pandering to nativism (like in Denmark), sometimes not (like in UK and US).\n\nMainstream rightwing parties have so far persisted, but their electoral success on the basis of radical right lite programs will not last forever. In the end, their only chance to sustain the electoral success is by transforming into full-fledged radical right parties, as we have seen in Hungary, Israel and the US. The only other way to survive is to re-establish conservative and Christian democratic programs that do not undermine the liberal democratic system and values.\n\nWhile still a minority, a growing number of right-wing politicians, including within the powerful European People\u2019s party, are starting to understand that, rather than having played the far right, the far right has played then. To survive, they will have to re-establish their own ideological programs and put the defense of liberal democracy at the center of their political struggle."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/the-government-response-to-the-bushfire-crisis-has-been-evasive-tepid-tone-deaf-and-above-all-too-late", "published": "2020-01-06T01:15:05", "title": "The government response to the bushfire crisis has been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and above all, too late | Kevin Rudd", "text": "\u200bIt\u2019s hard to know what to write in the midst of a national apocalypse.\u200b\u200b\n\nI\u2019m like most Australians, feeling every shade of human emotion each day as we see this living tragedy unfold before us.

And on the question of \u201cwho\u2019s going to pay\u201d? I remember it well during the Victorian fires.\n\nThe answer should simply be: \u201cWhatever it takes. Just get it done.\u201d\u200b\u200b\n\nSecond, the National Bushfire Recovery Agency announced on Sunday should be underpinned by national legislation, jointly with the states, and empowered to slice through red tape.\n\nThere should be a national bushfire appeal \u2013 the Black Saturday appeal raised more than $400m \u2013 and its disbursement should be coordinated by new agency to avoid waste and duplication.\n\nThe taxable 13-week disaster recovery allowance should immediately be extended to 26 weeks and be exempted from tax, as it was in Victoria. The disaster relief payment of $1,000 has also lagged inflation, meaning its real value has fallen substantially since 2009.\n\nThird, provide proper permanent funding for the nation\u2019s bushfire services. The public will not tolerate any longer a discretionary \u201ctop-up\u201d by the feds, or the usual buck passing between the various levels of government. Each brigade needs to be confident of their long-term funding.

Not enough it seems for Scott Morrison, who says there will be no change in policy whatsoever.

The truth is he doesn\u2019t give a damn about policy. Abbott has always been 100% politics. He\u2019s always seen climate as the perfect political wedge against Labor among working families, deploying fear campaigns based on wildly exaggerated projections about jobs and the cost of living. He\u2019s done the same internally, using it to divide and conquer his moderate opponents in the Liberal party.\n\nPretty tawdry when now we see half the country going up in smoke!\u200b\u200b\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub. The Abbott denialist cult has taken over the entire Coalition. It continues under Morrison and, when they oust him soon, it will continue under Peter Dutton. It\u2019s become the battle cry of the far right which now runs the entire conservative show in Canberra. \u200b\u200b\n\nAnd yes, before the Murdoch media leap to Abbott\u2019s defence, I know he is a firefighter. Good on him. The problem is most of the fire chiefs just don\u2019t agree with him on the impact of climate change. Nor does the CSIRO. Nor does any credible climate scientist in the world.\n\nIn Australia, as in America, the conservatives\u2019 strategic partner in climate change denial has been the Murdoch media. Rupert Murdoch, feeling the heat of public opinion, claimed recently there were no climate deniers at News Corp! The Murdochs, senior and junior, must believe the Australian people are total fools. Murdoch\u2019s papers remain a command centre for the entire mission of climate policy obstruction.\n\nJust look at their climate coverage over the last four federal elections.\n\nIn the midst of today\u2019s tragedy, we still see the old denialist trope trotted out that Australia, with only 1.3% of global emissions, can have no influence, and shouldn\u2019t bother trying. \u200b\u200bWhat pathetic nonsense.\n\nIf other middle-sized economies did the same \u2013 there are about 20 with a similar share of emissions \u2013 that\u2019s a quarter of the global total. We cannot work globally to get the biggest emitters \u2013 the US, China and India \u2013 to act unless we are also acting to clean up our own backyards. \u200b\u200b\n\nOur national interest dictates that Australia becomes once again a global climate change leader, not a follower. Unless we lead, and convince others to follow, Australia has a bleak future indeed. \u200b\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThe Australian people are angry. The Liberals and Nationals are now reaping what they have sown for more than a decade \u2013 through climate inaction at home, sabotaging climate negotiations abroad and a continuing pathology of poisonous fear mongering.\n\nThe melancholy truth is the only policies restraining Australian emissions today were taken under our government a decade ago.\n\nPrincipal among these is our legislated mandatory renewable energy target for 20% of electricity supply to be renewables by 2020. The conservatives said it would destroy the economy. It didn\u2019t. As a result, renewables are now 21%, up from 4% when we started.\u200b\u200b\n\nBut this is just the foundation stone of what must now become a bigger, bolder plan of national and international action.\n\nI stand by what I said a decade ago: climate change represents the greatest economic, environmental and moral challenge of our time. Moral because it\u2019s about what\u2019s right and wrong for the nation. Moral because it\u2019s about intergenerational justice.\n\nThe Liberals won\u2019t change on climate. Denial is now their DNA. They may start pretending to care. Scotty from marketing is good at that. But we all know it will be paper thin. That\u2019s why this lot have to go. Before it\u2019s too late for us all."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/06/south-africa-v-england-second-test-day-four-live", "published": "2020-01-06T10:18:36", "title": "South Africa v England: second Test, day four \u2013 live!", "text": "What term do you want to search?

It had, bar outstanding goals by Anthony Knockaert and Harry Arter, been a turgid afternoon\u2019s football and Smith did not hide the fact he was happy to be spared further distraction. Asked for his feelings about, as the questioner put it, \u201ca great competition\u201d, Smith replied \u201cI think it was, I think it\u2019s lost its sparkle\u201d and went on to cite unfriendly kick-off times and the scheduling of previous finals on the same day as top-flight fixtures. It was a damning use of the past tense and the conundrum is clear: the more managers feel the Cup is not being respected from the top down, the less likely they are to bother with it; the more managers select shadow teams that can barely produce a spectacle, the less likely the authorities are to put the competition back on a pedestal. How can a way out be found? Nick Ames\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n2) Silverware a real incentive for Leicester\n\nBrendan Rodgers was quick to dismiss the notion that Leicester City have a free hit at the domestic cups because their Premier League rivals are scrambling for a top-four finish but acknowledged reaching the final of a competition would act as a reward for their rapid progress. After an FA Cup third-round victory over Wigan on Saturday, Leicester host Aston Villa in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday and Rodgers recognises the value of going the distance. Leicester won the league four years ago but have not reached a final since winning the League Cup in 2000. \u201cWe will fight to get to the final,\u201d said Rodgers, who will welcome back Jamie Vardy following a calf complaint. \u201cAnd that gives you the opportunity to have something tangible to show for your development over the course of the period.\u201d Ben Fisher\n\n3) Beatable Bravo always offers City\u2019s opponents hope\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit awkward,\u201d Tom Pope reflected. \u201cJohn wouldn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d The post-match meeting of the two teams in the dressing room was affected by the Port Vale top scorer\u2019s tweets about John Stones. Perhaps, however, Claudio Bravo should have been the one giving Pope the silent treatment. Pope converted Vale\u2019s first, and indeed only, effort on target. It is a recurring theme in Bravo\u2019s chastening City career, dating back to his dreadful debut year when Pep Guardiola used to complain his side kept conceding to the first shot without rationalising why. Recently, Liverpool, Atalanta and Dinamo Zagreb have scored with their first shots on target against Bravo, Everton and Southampton with their second. Those initial efforts have veered from the unstoppable to the rather stoppable. Whether luckless or useless, Bravo\u2019s presence can seem to gift the opposition a goal head-start and make it feel that City are playing with 10 men.

Photograph: Phil Oldham/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\n4) Wilbraham deserves poignant reward\n\nRochdale\u2019s life-affirming comeback against Newcastle was a triumph for 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham, 17-year-old Luke Matheson who created the latter\u2019s equaliser, and Brian Barry-Murphy, whose decision to introduce them as substitutes proved inspired. The manager boldly removed a terrorised Tyler Magloire on 30 minutes for Matheson before Wilbraham entered ahead of the second half and the striker subsequently fired in Matheson\u2019s 79th-minute cross to cancel out Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s opener. Wilbraham is a 22-year, 10-club veteran who lost his mother to illness last month. Of the equaliser he said: \u201cIt meant a lot. My mum was my biggest fan. Obviously for the family and everyone at the moment it\u2019s been a hard time. She drove me everywhere when I was younger in a little brown Fiesta, with about \u00a32.50 petrol money in to make training. I never had my dad around when I was younger so she was the only one.\u201d Jamie Jackson\n\n5) Cup rouses Tranmere and jolts Watford\n\nTranmere\u2019s three-goal comeback against Watford definitely had something magic about it. A team that had looked down and out and out of their depth gathered themselves and gave their all to get a result. But on the other side, Watford collapsed, with too many youngsters and no sense of collective responsibility. Perhaps, then, what these teams brought to the Cup was as important as what the Cup brought to them. Tranmere\u2019s Micky Mellon believed his team needed a performance to prove they were still on the up after promotion from League Two last year. For Nigel Pearson, however, there was a dispassionate analysis that said defeat was better than losing first-team players to injury. In a sense his point was proven as one rare regular, Nathaniel Chalobah, was forced off at half-time. But the jolt in Watford\u2019s momentum, not to mention a replay in Birkenhead, may come back to bother him yet.

Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n6) Solskj\u00e6r shows teeth despite insipid showing\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r revealed a different side of himself before and after his team\u2019s trip to Molineux. On Friday, he reacted to Robin van Persie\u2019s suggestion that he was too nice to manage Manchester United, wielding club legend status by reminding that he, scorer of that goal on that famous night in Barcelona and many others besides, and not the one-season wonder Dutchman, is a true keeper of the faith. It was a baring of teeth that his former colleagues, including an approving Roy Keane, say he has always been capable of. And following a positive post-match verdict on another insipid performance, in which his team hung on for a replay, Solskj\u00e6r turned his attention back to Van Persie\u2019s criticisms. \u201cThere are different ways to motivate and inspire players, and I do not always believe in scaring them to play better,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, we are in 2020.\u201d John Brewin\n\n7) Derby too good to languish so low\n\nDerby County\u2019s victory over Crystal Palace was ultimately another game in which the use of VAR became the main topic of discussion. Rightly so given the potentially pivotal use of the pitchside monitor by the referee, Michael Oliver, but that should not completely take away from an assured display by Phillip Cocu\u2019s men against opponents who sit a division above them. Wayne Rooney was key to that but there were also impressive showings from others in white and black, in particular Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone, and watching on there came the strong sense that Derby have too much experience as well as quality to be 17th in the Championship for much longer. Derby may not reach the play-offs \u2013 they are currently eight points off Swansea in sixth \u2013 but a serious push up the table should be well within their reach. Sachin Nakrani\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The likes of Tom Huddleston (right) should help lift Derby up the table. Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Offside via Getty Images\n\n8) Abraham\u2019s absence exposes Chelsea\u2019s striking deficiencies\n\nChelsea\u2019s reliance on Tammy Abraham was underlined again during their victory over Nottingham Forest. With Abraham given a welcome rest Michy Batshuayi was handed a rare start up front and Olivier Giroud was on the bench. Yet Batshuayi struggled to make an impact in general play and Giroud was an unused substitute once again. Lampard is not a fan of either forward and it would be a risk for him not to find cover for Abraham this month, especially as Giroud is desperate to leave. Aston Villa are the latest club to target the former Arsenal striker, with Internazionale, Lyon, Bordeaux and Crystal Palace also interested in striking a deal for the 33-year-old, whose lack of football this season has put his place in the France squad under threat before Euro 2020. Chelsea, who are interested in Red Bull Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner and Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, need to find a solution quickly.\n\n9) Lallana has a Liverpool role to play yet\n\nAs Everton made desperately heavy weather of a Merseyside derby that looked laid out for them to finally win at Anfield, Liverpool\u2019s oldest outfield head was a key influence in their deep disappointment. Once James Milner had departed prematurely \u2013 and worryingly for J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 Adam Lallana took Milner\u2019s armband and a leadership role he has rarely fulfilled since he gave up the captaincy of Southampton to head north. He nursed his stripling colleagues and debutant Takumi Minamino along as Everton were dominated. Injuries and the claims of other midfielders better suited to Klopp\u2019s style have restricted his impact but with injuries piling up, Lallana may yet play a role in Liverpool\u2019s path to the Premier League title. This is his sixth season at Anfield, more than likely the last, but he reminded he is someone who can be counted upon. JB\n\n10) Mourinho dissects video age\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho enjoys semantics but, in distinguishing between VAR and what he calls \u201cVR\u201d, Tottenham\u2019s manager made a real, and important, distinction. After lamenting the absence of video technology at the Riverside as Middlesbrough earned a deserved replay (Mourinho believed Ashley Fletcher\u2019s goal should have been disallowed for offside) \u2013 he explained that he applauded the idea of a VAR being used to support referees\u2019 decisions. However the system he has seen in use in the Premier League this season is, in practice \u201cVR\u201d \u2013 or a dictatorial remote referee. \u201cI like VAR but I don\u2019t like VR and we have VR,\u201d said Mourinho. There was still a time for a detour into semantics, namely when he suggested Tottenham\u2019s squad was so anorexic and inflexible they were now condemned to \u201cplaying without a striker\u201d in Harry Kane\u2019s hamstrung absence. That may surprise both Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min.

But, after a shock playoff loss, the Brady-Belichick axis could be coming apart\n\n\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, the truly shocking thing about the end of the New England Patriots\u2019 season was when it happened. Had the Patriots lost to the Kansas City Chiefs or Baltimore Ravens later in this NFL postseason, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have felt as cataclysmic. Great teams lose to great teams. But when the Patriots fell to the relatively unheralded Tennessee Titans on Saturday, scoring a measly 13 points in the contest, it felt like football had shifted. There\u2019s a very real chance we just witnessed the end of the Patriots Dynasty.\n\nTom Brady says retirement 'pretty unlikely' despite Pats' shock loss to Titans Read more\n\nIt was somewhat surreal that the Patriots were even playing on Saturday, as accustomed as they are to a first-round bye. Indeed, if there was a true turning point in the Patriots\u2019 season, a moment when it became clear that things weren\u2019t going to script for New England, it was when the lowly Miami Dolphins defeated them, at home, 27-24. That Week 17 loss knocked the Pats out of the second seed and forced them to play in the opening round of the NFL postseason for the first time since 2009.\n\nStill, heading into Saturday, the Patriots had gone 104 games between consecutive home losses. Fans had every reason to expect that the Titans wouldn\u2019t threaten that record. Instead, the streak ended the second a desperate Tom Brady threw a game-sealing pick-six to the Titans\u2019 Logan Ryan. The Patriots defense had done its best by limiting Tennessee quarterback Ryan Tannehill to a mere 72 yards, but the offense practically vanished in the second half. Next Saturday, it will be the Titans facing the Ravens while the Patriots\u2019 look ahead to an uncertain future.\n\nAnd yes, for perhaps the first time since head coach Bill Belichick pinned his fortunes to Brady, the future does feel like a huge question mark. To start things off, there\u2019s a very real chance that Brady could leave. His contract with the Patriots is coming to an end and early reports suggest that the 42-year-old is less open to taking a discount to remain with the team, as he has done in the past. Combined with whispers of possible tensions between Brady and Belichick, it\u2019s entirely possible that the Patriots will be starting next year with somebody else in the sport\u2019s most important position.\n\nIn the press conference immediately following Saturday\u2019s loss, Brady said he was not considering retirement, but he also refused to commit to anything so soon after his season came to an unexpectedly early conclusion. \u201cI love the Patriots,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest organization. Playing for Mr Kraft all these years and for Coach Belichick, there is nobody who has had a better career than me just being with them. I\u2019m very blessed and I don\u2019t know what the future looks like, and I\u2019m not going to predict it.\u201d\n\nEven if Brady does return to the Patriots, the team\u2019s championship window may already be firmly shut. After all, Brady is coming off a year where \u2013 maybe for the first time ever \u2013 he has looked old. He had his lowest touchdown total since 2003 and the third-worst completion total of his career. Brady wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that, for once, the Patriots\u2019 moves to bring him talented receivers on the cheap didn\u2019t pan out (it turns out that Antonio Brown and Josh Gordon weren\u2019t destined to replace Rob Gronkowski).\n\nAs a result, the Patriots were never quite as good as they appeared to be when they started out the season 8-0. For much of the season, the Patriots were able to lean on a talented defense, and exploit a relatively light schedule. Later losses to the Chiefs, Ravens and the Houston Texans revealed that they didn\u2019t quite stack up against well-constructed teams built around talented young quarterbacks. The Buffalo Bills\u2019 unexpected run to the playoffs suggested that the AFC East may soon evolve into something other than the cakewalk it has been in recent years.\n\nHistory, of course, has taught us not to completely count out the Pats, the \u201cDeath and Taxes\u201d of the NFL. It\u2019s not impossible that Brady returns to the Patriots in the offseason and has a bounce-back year. Maybe Belichick figures out a way to surround him with the right offensive weapons without weakening what should remain one of the league\u2019s best defenses. It\u2019s not out of the question for the Patriots to compete for at least one more Super Bowl. However, at the very least, the end has never looked closer.\n\nQuote of the week\n\n\u201cThere must be a winner to the game\u201d \u2013 the head referee going over the playoff overtime rules after the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Texans ended tied 19-19 at the end of regulation.\n\nThe official was stating the obvious: there\u2019s no way for a playoff game to end in a tie. But after each team\u2019s first overtime drive ended in a punt, it looked like we would be watching for a while. And then\u2026\n\n\n\nVideo of the week\n\nHouston Texans (@HoustonTexans) WATSON IS A MAGICIAN.@deshaunwatson | #BUFvsHOU pic.twitter.com/9p8Zdl8F0Z\n\nGiven how overtime had played out to that point, maybe it was inevitable that the Texans\u2019 crucial play emerged out of what looked like a complete disaster. On second and six, Houston quarterback DeShaun Watson somehow escaped a host of Bills defenders to find running back Taiwan Jones. Jones, who had a single reception on the year, picked up 34 yards and set up Houston\u2019s game-winning field goal. The Texans beat the Bills 22-19 and now face the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bills, meanwhile, will have an entire offseason to try to figure out how they were unable to bring down Watson on that play.\n\nStat of the week\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Drew Brees was left to face another playoff disappointment. Photograph: John David Mercer/USA Today Sports\n\n191. That\u2019s the number of passes thrown by New Orleans Saints\u2019 quarterback Drew Brees without an interception before the one he threw to the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 Anthony Harris on Sunday. It was a sign that things were not going to go as planned for New Orlean: Brees would later lose a fumble to end a promising drive in the fourth quarter. The Saints had led the NFL with the fewest turnovers allowed during the regular season but were burnt twice in crucial situations on Sunday. The Vikings ended up beating the Saints on Kirk Cousins\u2019s touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph in overtime. Brees never even got a chance to touch the ball. The Vikings, having pulled off one upset, will have to attempt another one as they will face the well-rested San Francisco 49ers on Saturday.\n\nMVP of the week\n\nRussell Wilson, QB, Seattle Seahawks. Wilson was at his dual-threat best in the Seahawks\u2019 17-9 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, picking up 325 yards through the air and 45 yards on the ground. On top of that, Wilson threw for one of Seattle\u2019s two touchdowns, while the other was thanks to his old friend Marshawn Lynch. While the Seahawks were able to lean on their franchise quarterback, the Eagles were forced to play backup Josh McCown after Carson Wentz left the game after a hit from Jadeveon Clowney, continuing Wentz\u2019s string of bad injury luck. The Seahawks now face the Green Bay Packers.\n\nElsewhere around the league\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Russell Wilson was brilliant on Sunday, but is he really better than Lamar Jackson? Photograph: James Lang/USA Today Sports\n\n-- It\u2019s looking like there might be further bad news coming for the New England Patriots. According to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, the league is planning to discipline the organization after they were caught filming the Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 sidelines during the regular season. It\u2019s not yet known what kind of punishment the Patriots will be facing but it could involve fines, the loss of draft picks or perhaps even suspensions. The Patriots, of course, were previously disciplined for videotaping the New York Jets\u2019 defensive signals back in the 2007 SpyGate scandal.\n\n-- The Baltimore Ravens\u2019 Lamar Jackson will almost certainly be named the league MVP when the end-of-season awards are announced. He may not, however, be the unanimous selection. When the Associated Press named their All-Pro team, Jackson received 47 of the 50 votes at quarterback, with Wilson getting the other three votes.

The promotion of the New Zealander, who qualified through a grandmother, annoyed Danny Care, who for three years had appeared to be bound for Japan. Judging by the performances of the pair over the weekend, Eddie Jones not only made the right call but may be reluctant to jettison Heinz, who is now 33. The biggest single reason Gloucester came from behind to defeat Bath was Heinz\u2019s ability to react to what he saw rather than read from a script. Gloucester are a curious mix of a side: on the one hand they make basic mistakes and creak in the set pieces but on the other they have the ability to make much from little, the likes of Heinz, Danny Cipriani and Mark Atkinson loading the gun for Ollie Thorley, Louis-Rees Zammit, Jason Woodward and Jake Polledri to fire. They are the Premiership\u2019s wild cards. Paul Rees\n\n\u2022 Match report: Gloucester 29-15 Bath\n\n2) Tigers show signs of improvement\n\nSuddenly Welford Road feels a more uplifting place. This was a second consecutive match at the grand old fortress of English rugby that might be accounted \u201cgood\u201d. Better still, unlike the preceding example (a home defeat by Exeter), Leicester won it. It seems ridiculous, given their personnel, to note how well Leicester can play when the mood takes them. Whatever else happens, this will not be their last win of the season, even if the Six Nations looms into view to disrupt them, just as they find some form. Bristol, meanwhile, drop out of the top four to join a band of seven clubs frantically scrambling for the higher ground as the black tide rises angrily beneath them. None of them is safe \u2013 not even Leicester.

He favours a glass-half-full approach, suggesting attack remains the Exiles\u2019 best form of defence as they seek to work their way up the table. Given they scored four tries against the league leaders he may have a point. If Irish can also get all their best players fit for the run-in, they will remain hopeful of recovering from their midwinter slump. \u201cIt\u2019s the first half of games that we\u2019re doing damage to ourselves,\u201d suggested Kidney. That\u2019s where we need to make ourselves better.\u201d For the moment, though, Kidney must soldier on without his Irish internationals Paddy Jackson and Sean O\u2019Brien, neither of whom is set to be available for several more weeks, and hope that the Wallaby lock Adam Coleman\u2019s shoulder problem is not overly serious.

Quins were narrow in Salford and bypassed all too often. The experience of Mike Brown is being missed at full-back and Sale have one of the strongest squads in the Premiership. Quins have a core of hardened international experience yet they have conceded at least 30 points in five league and Champions Cup matches this season. \u201cWe were not good enough and got beaten up,\u201d said their director of rugby, Gustard, who took aim at his England prop Joe Marler for a loss of discipline at the start of the second half that cost him 10 minutes in the sin-bin. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d said Gustard about the prop putting his forearm in the face of an opponent. \u201cThere was no need for it.\u201d It is not just Marler who needs to get a grip.

Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images\n\n5) Fingers crossed for Fatialofa\n\nThere was a lot to talk about for such a one-sided and eminently predictable match. First of all Michael Fatialofa. Rugby is familiar with the long pause in play while a stricken player is tended to, so we know the precautions need not mean serious injury. Alan Solomons\u2019 openness afterwards, however, about how concerned he is gives us pause, as does the news that Fatialofa has been retained in hospital with his neck injury. Fingers remain crossed. Otherwise Saracens were content, in their bubble against an angry world, to celebrate the retirement of Nigel Wray in style. Ten tries \u2013 and it could have been more \u2013 is a statement in this league, whoever cops it. We now have the sight of a team with a points difference of plus 121 propping up the league. MA\n\n\u2022 Match report: Saracens 62-5 Worcester\n\n6) Wasps rue missed opportunity\n\nEvery point may well prove crucial in the bottom half of this season\u2019s Premiership and Wasps will be gutted not to have clung on to victory against 13-man Northampton having taken the lead with 10 minutes remaining of a dramatic high-scoring game. Then again, they won right at the end in Bristol a week earlier and will also know that home improvement will be fundamental if they want to avoid being sucked down into the relegation morass in the coming months. Their next three away league games, against Worcester, Leicester and London Irish, will be equally telling: there are signs of improvement visible but two wins out of eight is clearly less than ideal. Saints, on the other hand, have won six out of eight and have scored more tries and points than any other side in the Premiership. They may have been found out by Leinster in Europe but team spirit is healthy and winning is becoming a habit. \u201cWe made it hard for ourselves but I\u2019m massively proud of the boys,\u201d said man of the match Teimana Harrison.

The icing on the cake was a wonderfully assured winner from Curtis Jones, an 18-year-old scouser.\n\nThere were no Liverpool-born players in the Everton team, and maybe there should have been but Jones showed the local production line does not stop at Trent Alexander-Arnold. Not only did he beat the England goalkeeper with a perfectly executed right-foot curler from the edge of the area but, from the way he pointed to the space in front of him to indicate to Divock Origi where he wanted the ball played, he clearly had a picture in his mind of exactly what he wanted to do.\n\nWhether the same can be said of Ancelotti after this reality check is debatable. Even before the Jones moment it had been a strikingly sub-par Everton performance, otherwise the visitors might have been two or three up at half-time. Adri\u00e1n did well to keep out attempts from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Mason Holgate and Richarlison, though in each case the ball seemed to travel straight to the goalkeeper rather than heading for the space around him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It was a bad night at the office for Everton. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters\n\nWhat was more significant was the role Theo Walcott played in most of Everton\u2019s early attacks. Given a free role to get forward in support of the front two, Walcott\u2019s ability to find space on the right and through the middle gave his side a penetrative edge that better finishing would have turned into an advantage.\n\nCalvert-Lewin has been the poster boy for Everton\u2019s revival since the departure of Marco Silva, yet he needed to be stronger and sharper here, if only because he will not get that many opportunities to play against a Liverpool defence lacking Virgil van Dijk. When Walcott delivered his best cross of the first half Calvert-Lewin launched himself at it a fraction too early. When he had the opportunity to play in the better-placed Djibril Sidib\u00e9 just before the interval he instead dragged a shot narrowly wide.\n\nLiverpool 1-0 Everton: FA Cup third round \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nIn both cases he would not have found himself in as much space against the regular Liverpool defence. Holgate might have been guilty of missing the best chance of the evening, though as a defender he has a ready-made excuse. Calvert-Lewin has been bullied on occasion by Van Dijk this season and probably imagined he would be in for another bruising encounter in the Cup tie but, given an unexpected amount of freedom, he was unable to show the sort of incisiveness Ancelotti will have been looking for.\n\nEverton were left to regret their first-half profligacy as Liverpool stepped up their efforts and kept them pinned back after the break. They were unable to manage a second-half shot on target and, when Walcott squandered a promising situation with a jaw-droppingly awful pass just before Liverpool scored, it was easy to see why. He was withdrawn soon afterwards though, if some of his first-half efforts had got the rewards they deserved, he might have been the game\u2019s decisive figure. Instead that honour falls jointly to Jones for his goal and Klopp for his nerve, though when you have squad resources this good at your disposal, it would be remiss not to use them."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/chelsea-reading-womens-super-league-match-report", "published": "2020-01-05T15:04:25", "title": "Chelsea complete comeback win over Reading in Sam Kerr\u2019s promising debut", "text": "Sam Kerr\u2019s all-action Chelsea debut yielded everything but a goal as Emma Hayes\u2019s side came from behind at home to Reading.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty high-paced,\u201d said the forward of her introduction to the Women\u2019s Super League just over a week after landing in London. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bit rusty coming back from a break but I always want to start.\u201d\n\nThe post-Sam Kerr reality is proving a harsh one for Perth Glory | Ella Reilly Read more\n\nThe Australian provided her first assist in a Chelsea shirt, for Beth England, and was responsible for Reading\u2019s reduction in their numbers after Grace Moloney was shown red for taking out the NWSL and W-League record goalscorer.

Private firms have also baulked at joining the stock market, which is considered a route to broader investments from pension funds, international investors and individual savers.\n\nAccording to data firm Dealogic, just 34 companies applied to be listed in the UK over the last year, the lowest number since 2009. The amount of money raised from new UK listings nearly halved compared with the year before to \u00a33.7bn.\n\nThe decline in new listings and rise in the number of existing stock market listed firms quitting to go private is expected to accelerate a decline in the proportion of publicly listed companies, not just in London, but in most major stock markets.\n\nPinsent Masons blamed Brexit uncertainties for depressing the value of UK-listed firms compared to their European counterparts and making them more attractive to foreign buyers.\n\nThe rise in deals may also reflect management teams being more receptive to partnering with PE funds to take a company private, said the law firm. Managers may believe that public markets undervalue their companies and are therefore open to offers from PE funds, though a majority of shareholders must agree to any takeover bid.\n\nJulian Stanier, a partner at the law firm said: \u201cThe speed at which companies are going private principally boils down to depressed share prices, low interest rates and the massive firepower of Private Equity.\n\n\u201cAttractive valuations have enabled PE funds to acquire companies with strong fundamentals at prices below recent norms. We expect to see this activity continue into 2020. A new government with a strong majority has further added to the attractiveness of UK companies,\u201d he said.\n\nStanier said record-low interest rates in the UK and Europe made it cheaper to fund deals. Also, private equity funds were \u201csitting on large amounts of capital which they are under pressure to deploy\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis has resulted in PE funds considering a wider range of opportunities in order to put investors\u2019 money to work, including acquiring listed companies.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/06/aldi-sales-christmas-stores", "published": "2020-01-06T08:23:29", "title": "Aldi sales reach record \u00a31bn at Christmas as it opens more stores", "text": "Retailer says it sold 55m mince pies and 22m pigs in blankets in run-up to Christmas\n\nAldi sales reach record \u00a31bn at Christmas as it opens more stores\n\nChristmas sales at Aldi topped \u00a31bn for the first time, as the German-owned discount supermarket continued its rapid expansion in the UK.\n\nSales in UK in the four weeks to Christmas Eve rose by 7.9% compared with the same trading period of the previous year, the grocer said on Monday.

Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled.\n\nThe Institute of Student Employers said employers were planning to increase graduate recruitment by just 3%, compared with the 18% rise in graduate vacancies predicted this time last year.\n\nManagers also failed to meet student recruitment targets last year by around 3%, it added. If that pattern persists, the graduate market will be stagnant in 2020, marking the worst graduate jobs growth rate since 2016.\n\nWhile it is not as bleak as the 25% drop in the graduate jobs market seen in 2008/2009, the ISE said it was a sign that employers are hesitant to increase investment in new staff. Stephen Isherwood, the ISE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe graduate jobs market is an early indicator of the health of the economy as employers tend to plan further ahead when deciding their graduate recruitment needs.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe ISE said that a 14% rise in vacancies in the charity and private sectors was the only saving grace for the graduate labour market overall, which would otherwise be at risk of shrinking this year. This is partly due to the government\u2019s plans to increase spending on policing and the NHS.\n\nGrowth in the number of apprenticeship and school leaver programme vacancies also slowed to 2% from 7% last year, suggesting that a spike in openings sparked by the apprenticeship levy may be peaking.\n\nIsherwood said: \u201cOutside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we\u2019ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best. If the government want to see further growth in the apprentice market, they need to address employer concerns about how the apprentice levy works.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/05/scotland-and-north-of-england-to-be-hit-by-winds-of-up-to-75mph-flooding", "published": "2020-01-05T20:03:34", "title": "Scotland and north of England to be hit by winds of up to 75mph", "text": "Scotland and north of England to be hit by winds of up to 75mph\n\nWinds of up to 75mph (120km/h) are forecast to hit Scotland and the north of England on Tuesday, while south-west England faces risk of flooding.\n\nCoastal communities across the north-east of England and the west of Scotland are most at risk from gales, where exposed areas could experience gusts of 70-75mph, according to the Met Office, which issued yellow weather warnings for the two regions.\n\nInland winds are set to reach 50-60mph, with bus and train services likely to be delayed.

Some student unions have been threatened with legal action if they attempt to prevent anti-abortion groups opening on campus.\n\nAccording to the National Union of Students (NUS) there are now at least 14 anti-abortion societies in university students\u2019 unions around the UK, many of which have faced fierce opposition from students who are overwhelmingly pro-choice.\n\nMost recently there have been a series of demonstrations by anti-abortion campaigners outside Cardiff University, which have prompted counter-protests by some students. The rise in tensions followed a vote by the students\u2019 union to adopt an official pro-choice stance, in common with other universities.\n\nIsadora Sinha, a postgraduate student of bioinformatics at Cardiff, proposed the motion which gained overwhelming support when put to a vote in November.

Unfortunately, there has been backlash against this motion passing despite it having passed by a democratic vote by hundreds of students.\u201d\n\nStudents\u2019 unions at universities including Birmingham, Nottingham, Aberdeen and Strathclyde have been forced to lift bans against anti-abortion groups when faced with possible legal challenges over free speech.\n\nAn organisation called the Alliance of Pro-Life Students (APS) supports students to set up their own anti-abortion societies.

They are setting out strategically to try to engage more younger people and get younger people advocating against abortion.\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate policy, that\u2019s quite new. It\u2019s an orchestrated campaign, but where exactly it originates is unclear to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign that it\u2019s really being successful at the moment.\u201d\n\nRachel Watters, the NUS women\u2019s officer, agreed the anti-abortion movement was more visible on campuses, but it did not reflect any change of heart among students. \u201cStudents\u2019 unions and students have been passionate in campaigning about reproductive rights issues for decades.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that recent changes to the law on abortion in Northern Ireland had brought the issue back into focus. \u201cI don\u2019t think the general opinion of students will be massively influenced by the growth of these societies. Anti-choice societies have the right to express their views. Of course, students\u2019 unions, people in the student movement, also have a right to challenge what they are saying.\u201d\n\nKerry Abel, who chairs the campaigning group Abortion Rights, agreed: \u201cAnti-choice campaigners on campus are not new, but their strategies are \u2013 they are becoming more brazen.

An IT glitch meant that patients were not followed up to see how soon they would need potentially life-saving surgery.\n\nA doctor at the trust, however, says it initially repeatedly refused to take any action, raising further questions about its management.\n\nThe trust initially suggested the problem was the result of senior doctors not keeping up with emails, but later accepted its IT systems were at fault. The hospital was forced to recognise that patients were potentially put at risk and took action only after a whistleblower alerted the NHS regulator.\n\nThe Bury St Edmunds hospital is already at the centre of claims of bullying and intimidation after it demanded medical staff take fingerprint tests in an effort to identify a whistleblower who raised the alarm about potentially botched surgery with the family of a patient who died under its care.\n\nIt has offered a partial apology to staff and agreed to reflect on its tactics after the Guardian revealed its extraordinary response to an anonymous letter a member of staff sent to the patient\u2019s widow.\n\nResponding to the new claims, the hospital acknowledged problems had occurred with its vascular surgery services and confirmed that an investigation was under way, but insisted that no patients had been harmed.\n\nThe issue involves the handling of scans for patients with aneurysms which are conducted to detect signs of growth in case surgery is required to prevent a life-threatening rupture. Under the hospital\u2019s eCare system those scans were automatically deleted after 90 days. The hospital\u2019s email system failed to alert doctors that they needed to check the scans before they disappeared from the system.\n\nRegular monitoring of these patients is vital because consultants need to know whether an aneurysm has reached 5cm in diameter, at which point they require an operation before the swollen blood vessels bursts.\n\nBoyle, who is based at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, but also works at West Suffolk, was so concerned about patients not being followed up that he made entries on Datix, the NHS-wide system for flagging up patient safety incidents.\n\nBoyle, the associate editor of the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, did not respond to the Guardian after calls for comment. But a colleague and someone familiar with the issues both said Boyle made several Datix incidents reports about the problem.\n\nHis reports were dismissed, however, with a note saying that \u201cno further action\u201d was needed by the hospital\u2019s head of eCare system, Dr Dermot O\u2019Riordan, who previously served as the trust\u2019s medical director and its interim chief executive.\n\nBoyle was so alarmed by this failure to follow up his concerns that he reported the problem to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which inspects and rates hospitals, including on the safety of their care.\n\nO\u2019Riordan has not responded to a request to comment.\n\nThe unnamed doctor told the Guardian that the problem typified how the trust sought to bury any signs of failure. \u201cThe trust knew what happened and didn\u2019t act,\u201d he said. The trust\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Dunn, was awarded a CBE last year for services to health and patient safety.\n\nFollowing Boyle\u2019s intervention, the CQC asked the trust to explain its action both before and during its inspection visits in September and October. The trust is expected to lose its \u201coutstanding\u201d rating when the commission reports this month. The regulator has already said its maternity services need significant improvement.\n\n\u201cThe reporting system used by the NHS is an important protection for patients, but only if it works properly and is acted upon. Delays in monitoring patients with aneurysms is a serious matter, potentially a life and death matter,\u201d said Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, a patient safety charity.\n\n\u201cIt is very surprising that this was not acted upon and even more so if the doctor reporting concerns is senior. If patient safety is given the priority it deserves in a trust it should not need the CQC to intervene, but on behalf of the patients I am glad they did.\u201d\n\nA CQC spokeswoman said: \u201cWe were made aware of concerns regarding the handling of information submitted via the trusts\u2019 Datix incident reporting system. These concerns were followed up directly with the trust prior to and during CQC\u2019s latest inspection.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for West Suffolk NHS foundation trust said: \u201cRegrettably, we identified an issue with our vascular surgery services and an investigation is under way. All affected patients have been identified, are receiving the appropriate treatment and there is currently no evidence that patients have been harmed.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out that when it realised the problem might affect patients it recorded the potential problem on its risk register. It also introduced a new policy to ensure that doctors act on patients\u2019 results, including scans, within 28 days.\n\nAfter the Guardian revealed the unprecedented lengths to which the hospital had gone to identify whistleblowers last month, it appeared to acknowledge that it may have gone too far.\n\nIn a statement on its website after the story was published, it said: \u201cWe asked staff who were involved in the investigation to provide handwriting and fingerprint examples in order to immediately rule themselves out of the investigation. Staff were asked to provide these, and were not threatened with disciplinary action if they chose not to do so.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that for some colleagues involved that it did not necessarily feel that way and that this was a very difficult and stressful situation for them, for which we are sorry.\u201d\n\nIt stopped short of acknowledging that the tactics were wrong, but added: \u201cKnowing the impact it has had on staff involved, we will continue to reflect on as an organisation on our approach.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/05/paradise-lost-locals-flee-eden-as-australia-bushfires-race-towards-them", "published": "2020-01-05T13:27:03", "title": "Paradise lost: residents flee Eden as Australia fires race towards them", "text": "Shelley Caban just wants it to be over.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Fuck it, just burn it all, the house and everything,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the waiting and the limbo, you just feel like anything has to be better.\u201d\n\nWhen Guardian Australia spoke to Caban on Sunday, the 33-year-old was sheltered inside the safety of an unregistered bus-turned-refuge on the wharf in the coastal New South Wales town of Eden with her husband, Oliver Tratham-Webb, her three daughters Pearl, Aster and Aria, three dogs, a cat and several ducklings.\n\n'We realised we can't stop this': locals flee inferno that smashed NSW village of Wingello Read more\n\nThey have not seen home \u2013 a historic 150-year-old timber house in the picturesque Nethercote Valley just south of Eden in the state\u2019s far-south \u2013 since New Year\u2019s Eve, when they woke to chokingly thick smoke outside their home, packed the bus and left.\n\n\u201cI just knew we had to get out of there,\u201d she said.\n\nNow they find themselves among the thousands of Australians displaced indefinitely by the bushfire emergency gripping this country, a rolling crisis that has torn through great swaths of the east coast since November.

But the defense subsequently failed to get other charges against Weinstein dropped in December 2018, after the judge ruled the court had found \u201cno basis for the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial or law enforcement misconduct\u201d.\n\nLast summer, prosecutors obtained a new indictment allowing for Sciorra to testify \u2013 a move a Weinstein\u2019s lawyers called \u201cdesperate\u201d. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers faced another setback in October when the defense lost its bid to move the trial to another city: the court rejected the former producer\u2019s concern that he wouldn\u2019t get a fair trial in what his lawyers referred to as the \u201ccircus-like atmosphere\u201d of media in New York. Unlike other high-profile court cases in the US, this trial will not be televised.\n\n\ufeff\u201cI\u2019m trying as much as I can to brace myself for the worst possible scenario,\u201d the actor Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to speak out against Weinstein, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd at the same time I feel really hopeful because this is a historic moment and it feels like the message could get out there to people that your stories matter and the judicial system will do something about it.\u201d\n\nKendall came forward as part of the New York Times\u2019 initial investigation into Weinstein, alleging he harassed her in 1993. She has since sought out therapeutic resources, like the trauma workshops led by fellow Weinstein accuser Louise Godbold.\n\n\u201cIf this man walks free it is not just an insult to those of us who have lost friends, families, careers as a result of coming forward with the truth,\u201d Godbold told the Guardian, \u201cbut it is sending a dangerous predator back into the world.\u201d\n\nThe former actor and screenwriter Louisette Geiss emphasized her frustration with the limited scope of the criminal trial. \u201cIn the class action we know of 150 women he\u2019s affected,\u201d Geiss told the Guardian.\n\nA mother to four, Geiss left Hollywood for real estate after she said Weinstein tried to make her to watch him masturbate in front of her as she was pitching a movie at the Sundance film festival in 2008.\n\nShe now serves as co-chair of the $25m civil settlement against Weinstein and the Weinstein Company.\n\n\u201cWe all know that the court of public feelings are very important around these decisions and if he\u2019s seen as this poor guy \u2026 that\u2019s not going to fly,\u201d she said, in reference to his recent media appearances.\n\nWeinstein has begun appearing with a walker, and while recovering from spinal surgery, he granted a rare photo opportunity and interview to the New York Post.\n\n\u201cI feel like the forgotten man,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cI made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I\u2019m talking about 30 years ago. I\u2019m not talking about now when it\u2019s vogue. I did it first! I pioneered it!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harvey Weinstein leaves Manhattan criminal court in December. Photograph: Bryan R Smith/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWeinstein has said he sustained a serious back injury in a car accident in August last year. But some are skeptical of the optics of his interview.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wealthy man \u2013 he knows how to do PR for himself \u2026 So it is very important for us since we can\u2019t be on the stand to make sure we let America know what a bad guy he is,\u201d Geiss said.\n\nThings will only more heated once the trial begins on Monday, a housekeeping day when the judge will outline the schedule, and it\u2019s expected to drag on for weeks. Jury selection is set to begin on Tuesday, and jurors have been told to prepare for a case lasting up to two months.\n\nThe Los Angeles district attorney\u2019s office is considering whether to bring charges in eight separate cases against Weinstein. London\u2019s Metropolitan police force continues to investigate allegations of misconduct. But for now, all eyes are on the New York trial.\n\n\u201cConsidering every other horrific thing that happened so far in this criminal case with Harvey, I now live in the worst-case scenario,\u201d Brock said.\n\n\u201cThe system is broken,\u201d Brock continued. \u201cAnd therefore no, I do not feel confident any more that the right thing will happen because life is not a Spielberg movie.

There were no crises in their vision \u2026 only opportunities.\n\nWiener interviewed former colleagues and friends, engaging in what she calls \u201ca dance around everyone else\u2019s NDA\u201d. She also scoured her iMessage chats and email archive for granular details, such as the humourless office flag that read \u201cIn Meritocracy We Trust\u201d or the CEO in his 20s who instructed employees to BCC his mother on the company\u2019s customer support communications. \u201cMy Gmail is an incredible corpus of mid-20s work anxiety,\u201d she sighs. \u201cAnd an archive of what in hindsight are very obvious ways to navigate work situations that were overly complex, because I didn\u2019t know how to be a person.\u201d\n\nThe book first took shape in 2015 as a lightly fictionalised essay for the Brooklyn-based literary magazine n+1. Wiener\u2019s piece went viral but the surge of attention came as a shock. \u201cI thought that no one in literary n+1 world would care about Silicon Valley startups, and that no one in Silicon Valley reads n+1.\u201d For years, she had documented the cultish work rituals and peculiar cultural norms of the industry, but it wasn\u2019t until Dayna Tortorici, editor of n+1, visited San Francisco that she considered synthesising those observations into a cohesive narrative. \u201cDayna has a theory that people in tech aren\u2019t used to being seen because everything is mediated,\u201d Wiener says. \u201cI wrote the piece to entertain her.\u201d\n\nAs an editor, Tortorici had noticed an unnerving pattern: when writing about their workplaces, female contributors were often threatened for violating NDAs, whereas rarely, if ever were NDAs used against male writers. (Despite the industry\u2019s fervent defences of freedom of speech, most tech companies also enforce strict policies that ensure former employees stay silent about work conditions, including sexual harassment allegations.)\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t face NDA-related constraints, Wiener\u2019s first drafts were fairly restrained. Tortorici encouraged her to reveal more about her former bosses without worrying about reprisals. By 2018, Wiener had left her job at the software development platform GitHub after a seven-way auction to expand the original n+1 essay into a book. (And in January 2018, Universal Pictures optioned film rights; the screenplay is now in its initial development stages and Wiener is executive producer.) \u201cI very deliberately wrote this book as non-fiction and memoir,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause if I wrote it as fiction, it could be mistaken as satire. And I don\u2019t know how politically useful satire about the tech industry is in 2019. I want this book to be politically useful.\u201d\n\nWiener, now 32, grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her mother is a writer and gun-control activist \u2013 co-founder of the nonprofit New Yorkers Against Gun Violence \u2013 and her father a business journalist; she was exposed to feminist ideas and progressive politics at a young age. In person, Weiner is self-possessed. Apart from bitten fingernails and frank asides about therapy there are few signs of neuroses, although she says: \u201cI have very bad anxiety.\u201d Her worries around the book centre on her use of creative non-fiction techniques: the story is based on real events, but the specific timeline and characters are compressed for clarity and cohesion. She is concerned about whether people in the tech industry will understand the conventions of this approach \u2013 and about possible backlash from tech executives whose public images can directly affect their companies\u2019 stock value. \u201cI sometimes have these daytime nightmares about testifying in court about creative non-fiction, where I\u2019m like, \u2018I would like to summon Vivian Gornick to the stand to explain compression,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019d like to bring in John D\u2019Agata to discuss composite characters.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Silicon Valley \u2026 \u2018You can practically throw a spitball and hit a badly named company.\u2019 Photograph: yhelfman/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nJust as New York City is a core character in Ben Lerner\u2019s auto-fictitious 10:04 and various areas of California play leading roles in Joan Didion\u2019s seminal essay collection The White Album, both influential texts for Wiener, San Francisco and its immersive digital world are central characters in Uncanny Valley.

We certainly weren\u2019t thinking about our role in facilitating and normalising the creation of unregulated, privately held databases on human behaviour.\u201d She continues: \u201cUsers might not know they were being tracked, but that was between them and our customer companies.\u201d\n\nWhile writing, Wiener studiously avoided reading books about the tech industry, and instead focused on office novels and compact memoirs, including Renata Adler\u2019s groundbreaking novel Speedboat, which centred on a New York journalist in the 70s; and Ana Castillo\u2019s The Guardians, a novel about a Mexican-American woman living along the US/Mexico border. \u201cI tried to reread Ellen Ullman\u2019s Close to the Machine a little bit stoned in a hot bath \u2013 an ostensibly relaxing situation \u2013 and almost had a panic attack. It\u2019s essentially a perfect memoir and sets the standard,\u201d she explains. (Ullman is an engineer who documented her experience developing software at the forefront of the male-dominated technology boom in the 90s.)\n\nFor a moment, Wiener is distracted by the cafe\u2019s playlist as Nirvana thunder over the speakers. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m 16 and burning incense in my bedroom and telling my mom I\u2019m a vegetarian,\u201d she deadpans.\n\nWe return to unpacking Silicon Valley\u2019s accountability problem and popular modes of aggrandisement. \u201cThe way that people spoke in San Francisco was so strange to me, like all of the acronyms, jargon and weird things that people do to the English language. To inspire us in a meeting, one CEO said, \u2018We\u2019re at war!\u2019 And like, \u2018Learnings.\u2019 Why? It\u2019s \u2018lesson\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI find the naming scheme of the last 15 years in tech companies to be very funny, these names are just obscene.\u201d She rattles off AppLovin and Verbling as two of her favourites. \u201cYou can practically throw a spitball and hit a badly named company.\u201d\n\nThroughout the memoir, there are moments when Wiener acquiesces to male characters\u2019 demands only to correct her course with a renewed sense of agency. In a memorable scene, she goes out to a Japanese bar with her mostly male co-workers to celebrate their boss\u2019s birthday, conceiving of herself as the \u201cbabysitter, fifth wheel, chaperone, little sister, ball and chain, and concubine\u201d. She explains: \u201cI was always trying to be someone\u2019s girlfriend, sister or mother.\u201d (Uncanny Valley takes place in the years leading up to the #MeToo movement; details about a sexual assault incident were withheld from the book to protect her former colleague\u2019s anonymity.)\n\nThe 2016 election result strikes at the end of the book with cataclysmic force, no doubt a reflection of the way the author herself experienced the event. \u201cThe major failure of the media in the years leading up to the election was to not take tech companies and their ambitions very seriously,\u201d Wiener says. \u201cThe media engaged with the industry on the industry\u2019s terms. It lapped up the mythology.\u201d\n\nIn reference to the founders of an ebook startup, Wiener\u2019s first tech job, she writes: \u201cI envied their sense of entitlement to the future. There were no crises in their vision \u2026 only opportunities.\u201d In California, this techno-optimist outlook is often associated with anti-union, libertarian politics. By contrast, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve always had a hard time picturing a future, which one could credit to having witnessed a major terrorist attack as a teenager.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIn my head I was like, don\u2019t mention 9/11.\u201d She continues: \u201cMy hope for the future is that we start to move slower and at a smaller scale.\u201d\n\nAt the end of Uncanny Valley, after the 2016 election, Wiener writes that she felt that the industry \u201cwas in for a reckoning, that it was the beginning of the end, that what [she] had experienced in San Francisco was the final stage of a prelapsarian era, the end of our generational gold rush, an unsustainable age of excess.\u201d A freewheeling culture of misinformation, offensive memes and trolling \u2013 unfettered by regulation or oversight \u2013 only proliferated. Wiener says: \u201cThe city and the industry, bound by the ecosystem, continued to cycle and churn.\u201d\n\nHow big tech is dragging us towards the next financial crash Read more\n\nOf course, conflicting views of the future also reflect a greater schism in industry. Just as the publishing world shrinks, tech companies bloat with capital. \u201cIf we continue on the track that we\u2019re on, we\u2019re going to move into an era of even greater privatisation,\u201d Wiener says, shifting uncomfortably in her chair. \u201cThe future will be increasingly homogeneous, divisive and private.\u201d To illustrate this point she highlights public goods or services that are increasingly privatised, like for-profit coding boot camps, which are marketed as an investment or a substitute for a four-year university degree. \u201cThe tech industry is trying to provide solutions to crises that they didn\u2019t necessarily create, but that they are now exacerbating.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves better. Especially employees and consumers. But I don\u2019t know that change is going to come from within the industry because the incentives of venture capital encourage speed and rapid growth, which inspire a certain thoughtlessness \u2013 or recklessness.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThere is currently very little accountability.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Uncanny Valley: a Memoir is published by HarperCollins (RRP \u00a316.99).

Just look at how the battle epic Midway, er, bombed last month. The workaround seems to be a new kind of war story centred on soldiers who really don\u2019t want to kill anyone. You could call it a \u201cpacifist war movie\u201d.\n\nSam Mendes\u2019s latest film, 1917, is a classic example. In real time, it follows two British soldiers in France on a dangerous mission to warn another battalion they are about to walk into a German trap. These men want to stop the killing rather than add to it. Even when one of them encounters a wounded German soldier, his first instinct is to get him a drink of water.\n\nMendes clearly learned his lesson after his previous war film, 2005\u2019s Jarhead, in which Jake Gyllenhaal and co were sent into the first Gulf war primed to kill, but spent a lot of time waiting around and bickering with each other. It was a faithful reflection of modern warfare but also a bit dull. By contrast, 1917 is cinematic and action-packed without revelling in the bloodshed.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern with prestige war dramas lately. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk was, again, essentially a story about not killing and not getting killed. There were a few bits of combat to keep the flag flying, but the real victory was in retreat and rescue. Or think back to The Hurt Locker, focused on a bomb-disposal unit \u2013 people who bravely save lives rather than take them. Or Spielberg\u2019s Saving Private Ryan, whose combat scenes were vivid but whose central mission was to save a soldier\u2019s life. Even Wonder Woman\u2019s brief taste of trench warfare involved drawing fire, deflecting bullets and smashing enemy guns.\n\nPossibly the last word in pacifist war heroism has to be 2016\u2019s Hacksaw Ridge, with Andrew Garfield as a GI who refuses to handle a gun due to his religious beliefs, but achieves battle glory all the same by saving his wounded comrades. It was directed by legendary man of peace Mel Gibson, who previously brought you Braveheart and Apocalypto. Even more improbably, Hacksaw Ridge is closely based on a true story.\n\nSuch heroes do exist, and their bravery is in no way unworthy of recognition, but they are needles in a haystack. You can see the appeal for modern war auteurs: find one to base your movie on and you can mount your epic battle scenes without getting your hands too dirty or saluting the flag too overtly. All great war movies are really anti-war movies, but this modern variety leaves the impression that our military victories were achieved by being more decent and compassionate than our enemies, rather than, say, killing more of them than they did of us."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/06/graphic-novel-of-the-month-little-lulu-working-girl-john-stanley-review", "published": "2020-01-06T09:00:25", "title": "Little Lulu: Working Girl by John Stanley review \u2013 riot girl in a little red dress", "text": "I must admit that I knew nothing of Little Lulu until Drawn & Quarterly sent me the first volume of its full-colour reissue of her adventures (five are planned). Who is she, this dynamic demon of a little girl? Well, you could say that she is to American readers what Minnie the Minx is to those of us who grew up with the Beano. Like Minnie, she is smart, frequently badly behaved and not much given to following the rules; like Minnie, she is a kind of feminist icon, albeit one who wears a neat red dress and whose hair hangs in old-fashioned ringlets.\n\nLittle Lulu can outmanoeuvre any boy, reduce any adult to gobsmacked silence. No wonder, then, that her fans include not only Patti Smith and the poet Eileen Myles, but also Margaret Atwood, who has written the introduction to Little Lulu: Working Girl. (\u201cThe eternal problem of the boys\u2019 clubhouse \u2013 not being let into it, that is \u2013 was treated by Little Lulu, by and large, with a phnuh.\u201d)\n\nLittle Lulu, AKA Lulu Moppet, was the creation of Marjorie Henderson Buell, better known as Marge; she made her first appearance in a newspaper in 1935. When Marge stopped working on the strip in 1947, she was replaced by John Stanley, a journeyman comics writer much admired by his peers for his singular wit; he would draw her for the next 14 years and it\u2019s his surreal and subversive stories that are collected here.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A page from Little Lulu: Working Girl by John Stanley. Photograph: Drawn & Quarterly\n\nThose who like to think of the 50s as a time when women and children were seen rather than heard are in for a surprise in the case of the pugnacious and endlessly resourceful Lulu, whose voice is almost permanently raised and whose raison d\u2019etre is basically to show the boys that girls are just as good as they are. When she falls out with her best friend, Tubby, it\u2019s always he who ends up eating humble pie. When Alvin, the bratty six-year-old she is sometimes required to babysit, has one of his temper tantrums, only Lulu can shut him up, a silence she wins by telling him elaborate stories (Lulu\u2019s way with narrative is one of the things that drew the young Atwood to her).\n\nWith her pithy put-downs and her easy way with half-truths, it\u2019s impossible not to warm to Little Lulu, though I like Tubby as well, a boy who will stop at almost nothing in order to bag himself a second dinner. There\u2019s something intensely pleasurable, too, in the way that Stanley uses phonetic spellings and mangled pronunciations for comic effect (\u201cDear diry, I felt terrible bad in my stummik\u201d); at moments, it made me think of Molesworth.\n\nMost of all, though, I like the yawning gap that exists between children and adults in these strips: they\u2019re pro-child in the best sense, always pitting the open, curious minds of small people against the jaded, rigid outlook of those adults who try (and fail) to marshal them. If you like Charles Schulz and Roald Dahl \u2013 and really, who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 then this gorgeously produced and very funny book is for you.\n\n\u2022 Little Lulu: Working Girl by John Stanley is published by Drawn & Quarterly (\u00a318.99).

Susannah Cahalan\u2019s first book, Brain on Fire, described her first-hand experience of how catastrophically wayward such diagnosis can be.\n\nCahalan was working as a reporter at the New York Post in 2009 when, aged 24, she developed what appeared to be a kind of paranoid schizophrenia. She believed bedbugs were invading her apartment, that her father had tried to abduct and kill his second wife, she heard voices, spoke gibberish, was unable to sleep and descended into catatonia. It was only the persistence of her parents, and an extra series of tests, that discovered an extremely rare autoimmune disease that was attacking her brain. The diagnosis saved her from the psychiatric ward, where, left unchecked, her illness would have left her cognitive functions irreparably damaged.\n\nThat survivor\u2019s story led her into the history of mental illness and its treatment and, inevitably, to one of the most infamous of experiments, the 1973 study On Being Sane in Unsane Places, conducted by a Stanford psychologist, David Rosenhan. The study, published not long before the release of the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, involved a series of eight healthy patients presenting themselves at mental hospitals with made-up symptoms. In each case, in Rosenhan\u2019s account, the patients fooled the psychiatrists and were admitted to secure wards. The publication of these findings caused a huge stir in the world of psychiatry, as claims of objective certainty in diagnosis were apparently exposed as a sham, and subsequent treatment haphazard and invalid.\n\nGiven her own experiences, and her twitchy investigative reporter\u2019s nose, Cahalan was drawn to re-examine the case and its repercussions in the practice of psychiatry. The result of that inquiry is this compulsively readable book, in which she tries to track down the eight anonymous \u201cpseudopatients\u201d and examine the facts of their hospitalisation. Rosenhan died in 2012, the obituaries noting his famed experiment; with access to his original field notes, Cahalan was able to piece together the untold stories of his research and test them against reality.\n\nShe found only two of the eight pretend psychotics \u2013 as well as confirming that Rosenhan himself was one of them. Her efforts are so indefatigable that you are inclined to believe her hunch that the other five case histories may well have simply been made up. Even the detailed experience of those patients she was able to examine does not tally with Rosenhan\u2019s claims. The evidence of one of them, Harry Lando, was excluded from the final report because he confessed a positive experience of the treatment. \u201cHE LIKES IT,\u201d Rosenhan noted, with incredulity.\n\nFaith in the authority of diagnosis \u2013 for better and for worse \u2013 never quite recovered\n\nDespite the apparent shakiness of methodology, noted by opponents at the time, and confirmed here, Rosenhan\u2019s seductive findings had an enormous impact on the practice of psychiatry across the world. Within a decade, the antipsychiatry movement, fuelled by fears of asylums as a form of social control going back centuries, had helped to close 50% of American institutions. Faith in the authority of diagnosis, Cahalan argues \u2013 for better and for worse \u2013 never quite recovered.\n\n\u201cWhenever the ratio of what is known to what needs to be known approaches zero,\u201d Rosenhan once wrote, \u201cwe tend to invent \u2018knowledge\u2019 and assume that we understand more than we actually do. We seem unable to acknowledge that we simply don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe professor\u2019s instincts were to suggest that we\u2019d had enough of experts, but, if Cahalan\u2019s investigation is correct, he apparently stopped short of applying that wisdom to his own scientific work.\n\nCahalan, having unearthed these damning caveats, is not as damning as she might be. \u201cRosenhan\u2019s paper,\u201d she argues, \u201cas exaggerated and even dishonest as it was, touched on truth as it danced around it.\u201d That truth was the exposure of \u201cthe role of context in medicine\u201d, the importance of diagnostic doubt as well as faith. Is it possible, as Chief Bromden observed in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, that Rosenhan\u2019s findings represented \u201cthe truth even if it didn\u2019t happen\u201d? Cahalan is honest enough as a writer to leave that question hanging, having presented important and spirited cases both for the prosecution and the defence.\n\n\u2022 The Great Pretender by Susannah Cahalan is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99).

Film is the art of rascals!'", "text": "Arnaud Desplechin looks surprisingly calm as he excuses himself to listen to a voicemail from the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s technical team. France is one week into a general strike over pension reform and the country\u2019s premier theatre company has followed suit, resulting in cancelled performances and rehearsals. \u201cWe take it day by day,\u201d says Desplechin, whose new production of Angels in America is due to open in mid-January. \u201cIt will start to get difficult if it continues.\u201d We spoke in December and the strike is still going strong, but there is no plan to delay.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Tony Kushner\u2019s sprawling 1990s play about the Aids crisis is only Desplechin\u2019s second theatre project, his first being a 2015 version of August Strindberg\u2019s Father. The 59-year-old auteur is renowned for such character-driven screen dramas as Kings and Queen and My Golden Days, which often draw on his own life and background. Yet this month he will be in two Paris theatres at once, since an adaptation of his film A Christmas Tale is appearing at the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe.\n\nIt\u2019s an unlikely development for a film director who never pined for the stage. \u201cI always told myself I would never do theatre,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was for bourgeois, adult people, while I was making cinema, the art of rascals.\u201d Father, he says sheepishly, came out of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d. Eric Ruf, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s director, had a small part in My Golden Days, and one morning asked Desplechin if he would direct a production for the company, 10 minutes before filming was due to start. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, of course.\u2019 But if he\u2019d asked me to run around the block in my underwear, I would have done it \u2013 anything so the actor is good.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Festive froideur \u2026 Mathieu Amalric and Catherine Deneuve in A Christmas Tale. Photograph: Allstar/IFC FILMS\n\nRuf took him at his word and the result was Father. Angels in America is a more ambitious undertaking. Desplechin says the company was \u201cterrified\u201d when he proposed more than 40 set changes: the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise is a repertoire theatre, so productions must rotate from one day to the next, and come with a strict three-hour time limit. To make it work, Ruf, an experienced set designer himself, provided support and extra rehearsal time on the stage of the Salle Richelieu, the company\u2019s historical home, not far from the Louvre.\n\nDesplechin, who is focusing on the romantic relationships between the mostly gay characters, admits to some trepidation, not being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cI felt it was missing from my work,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that some heterosexual love stories have the privilege of being universal, while there is something singular about a gay story. So how do you make sure everyone in the audience is moved? Am I capable of it?\u201d Like fellow film-maker Christophe Honor\u00e9 \u2013 who crafted an impressive play, Les Idoles, about the toll the Aids crisis took on the French intellectual scene \u2013 Desplechin lost some of his artistic heroes to the illness, and vividly remembers the pervading sense of \u201cterror\u201d.\n\nWhen discussing his theatre work, the soft-spoken French director seems in awe of his Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise cast. \u201cThere is a technical knowledge that I don\u2019t have. I feel very lucky to be a student. If my actors are happy, if they think I haven\u2019t said anything stupid, then it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nA different side of Desplechin comes out when the conversation turns to cinema, his childhood love. \u201cOn film sets, I like to be the king,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a despot. When I need to go to the bathroom, everyone shouts, \u2018The king is going to the bathroom\u2019 \u2013 because it takes three minutes and everything is organised around me. I love it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You want a production to be the best it can be, the rest doesn\u2019t concern me\u2019 \u2026 Oh Mercy! starring L\u00e9a Seydoux (right).

Roubaix, the nondescript industrial city in northern France where he was born, has provided the background for many of his films, including A Christmas Tale and his latest, Oh Mercy! He even filmed his own family in a 2007 documentary, L\u2019Aim\u00e9e. \u201cYou work on a production, you want it to be the best it can be. The rest doesn\u2019t concern me.\u201d\n\nNot even, I ask, when he was sued, unsuccessfully, by his former partner Marianne Denicourt, who claimed in her 2005 book Evil Genius that Desplechin had lifted painful episodes from her personal life without permission to write Kings and Queen? Desplechin appears unconcerned: \u201cOf my films, it\u2019s the one that performed best at the box office, what can I tell you?\u201d\n\nThe rest of his family, he adds, has learned to live with it. \u201cYou know what they say: there is no worse curse than to have a child who is a writer. If you\u2019re Kafka\u2019s father, you\u2019re not going to be very pleased.\u201d Does Desplechin hope his own son won\u2019t turn to writing? He laughs. \u201cLook how much of a masochist I am. Of course I hope he\u2019ll be Kafka! As long as I\u2019m good material for him.\u201d\n\nDesplechin seems genuinely happy to take a back seat for his Angels in America \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m here to serve Kushner, that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 and to see A Christmas Tale reinvented for the stage. Don\u2019t expect him to write a play any time soon, however. \u201cI feel like you need a lifetime of theatre experience to do that.

You can explore the buzzing township by car or bike, but the best way to soak up the heady vibrancy is by getting out on two feet: down a beer with the locals, take in a show at the Soweto Theatre, or brave the Soweto Towers bungee jump. The thriving township also has sites of incredible cultural significance, including the Hector Pieterson Museum and Mandela House, Mandela\u2019s former home, which was set on fire twice by the apartheid-era police. The walls outside are still riddled with bullet holes.\n\nThe ultimate safari\n\nKruger national park; luxury at Earth Lodge\n\nIt\u2019s a decent drive \u2013 just under five hours \u2013 from Johannesburg to Kruger national park, but the schlep is more than worth it. As well as being one of the greatest places to see Africa\u2019s big five \u2013 lions, leopards, buffalo, elephants and rhinos \u2013 the national park heralds some spectacular safari sightings, such as hundreds-strong herds of elephants trumpeting and wallowing in vast waterholes. But you\u2019ll find fewer cars and some truly exquisite scenery at Sabi Sands \u2013 a private game reserve bordering the park. Earth Lodge \u2013 one of National Geographic\u2019s unique lodges of the world \u2013 is a jaw-to-the-floor kind of place, with brand new suites that seem to have been hewn from the earth itself. The lodge is built into the hillside and is entirely unfenced, meaning all manner of creatures could trot by your room. Watch out for packs of rare wild dogs on the roof and passing elephants.\n\nMarine dream\n\niSimangaliso wetland park\n\nStrap in for another long, absurdly picturesque drive. It\u2019s six and a half hours to iSimangaliso wetland park, South Africa\u2019s first world heritage site and a place of unparalleled natural beauty. Here, you\u2019ll find a collection of rare swamp forests, Africa\u2019s largest estuary and some of the world\u2019s highest coastal vegetated dunes, which date back 25,000 years. This is a haven for marine mammals, and you\u2019ll find humpbacks, southern right whales and frisky pods of bottlenose dolphins in these inky waters. The place to stay is the breathtaking Kosi Forest eco-lodge, lit almost entirely by candles. With rooms crafted from wood, tarpaulin and thatch, the lodge blends in effortlessly with the pristine forest scenery. Bathrooms are open to the star-studded skies, so listen out for the sound of hippos grunting in the distance as you wallow in your own sunken bathtub.\n\nEscape to the mountains\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Garden Route: discover the most scenic spots Read more\n\nTwo and a half hours due south \u2013 after winding through acacia groves, mining communities and busy streets flanked by fruit sellers \u2013 you\u2019ll reach the busy city of Durban, where you can take a rest stop or stay overnight if you want to refresh. Then, it\u2019s a two-hour drive to the indomitable Drakensberg mountains. This epic 600-mile chain of crumpled crags, yawning valleys, vast wildflower-strewn plains and the world\u2019s second-highest waterfall is a heart-juddering sight. A drive here involves high elevation and hairpin passes \u2013 including the Sani Pass, a steep road rising an awe-inspiring 2,876m (9,400ft) above sea level \u2013 but you\u2019ll be rewarded with spectacularly beautiful wilderness areas, such as Champagne Valley, replete with rolling mountain scenery, where you can hike, mountain bike or even rock-climb if you\u2019re feeling adventurous.\n\nWind your way down the wild coast\n\nThe Sani Pass; the Hole in the Wall\n\nHead back to the east coast \u2013 through rural Xhosa heartland \u2013 and then follow the road south; you\u2019ll soon find yourself on the route of South Africa\u2019s ruggedly beautiful Wild Coast, a 155-mile stretch of unspoiled coastline taking in rocky headlands, lagoons and powder-soft sand beaches. There\u2019s plenty of quality accommodation dotted along the coastal route and pretty little communities \u2013 such as Coffee Bay, where you can see the magnificent Hole in the Wall rock formation. The clifftops provide the perfect spot for hiking, horse-riding and ogling the dramatic shipwrecks that litter the beaches. The Wild Coast is also an angler\u2019s dream, and during winter months the sardine run attracts gaggles of frenzied visitors, from gannets and seals, to dolphins and predatory fish as the run moves its way slowly north along the coast.\n\nHow to book\n\nWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Johannesburg, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.\n\nGo for gold\n\nThe best place for a first-look at \u201cDurbs\u201d \u2013 as the locals call it \u2013 is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nShimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world\u2019s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.\n\nSurfing, whales and dolphins\n\nWith miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa\u2019s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade \u2013 try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf \u2013 will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.\n\nHit the water to surf or whale watch\n\nFrom May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde\u2019s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn\u2019t enough, you can often spot dolphins diving in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina; the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time\u2019s environmental research.\n\nAdventures in food\n\nOceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you\u2019ll find a neat cross section of the city\u2019s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha\u2019s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.\n\nBunny chow; macaroons at Sugarlicious\n\nBut when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don\u2019t leave without braving the famous \u201cbunny chow\u201d: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You\u2019ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (\u00a34.19).\n\nIt\u2019s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It\u2019s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.\n\nForests, nature reserves and secluded beaches\n\nThere\u2019s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.\n\nSoweto to the sea: the magical road trip from Johannesburg Read more\n\nA 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You\u2019ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers\u2019 market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa\u2019s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views \u2013 of breaching whales and the ocean \u2013 but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there\u2019s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.\n\nAnother 30 minutes\u2019 drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort\u2019s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.\n\nInto the heart of the country\n\nSouth Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours\u2019 drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.\n\nOn the beach at Umhlanga; the rugged Drakensberg mountains\n\nOr head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.\n\nSo now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing\u2019s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.\n\nHow to book\n\nWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The best way to take it all in? Fly direct with British Airways, pick up a hire car from Avis and hit the open road, pitstopping at the region\u2019s boutique hotels so you can take time to savour the local history and scenery. And the wine. Let\u2019s not forget the wine.\n\nCape crusader\n\nThe buzzing university town of Stellenbosch is full of oak-lined streets (it\u2019s not called the \u201ccity of oaks\u201d for nothing) and pretty whitewashed Cape Dutch houses. Work up an appetite (your stomach will thank you later) by going for a hike through the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, which has routes for everyone from seasoned hikers to only-brought-trainers types. Then head to Jordan, the restaurant on the Jordan Wine Estate, for lunch. Here, acclaimed South African chef George Jardine serves up smokey yellowtail, steamed Saldanha mussels, and a springbok pot roast. Don\u2019t leave without picking out your farm-made Karoo blue from the walk-in cheese room.\n\nStellenbosch vineyards; lunch at Jordan; typical Dutch-style architecture\n\nTake a post-prandial stroll down memory lane, AKA the historic Dorp Street, popping into the museums, art galleries and coffee shops. Make sure you visit Oom Samie se Winkel general trading store \u2013 a Stellenbosch institution. Then check out what\u2019s on at the Oude Libertas Amphitheatre \u2013 an open-air concert venue with views of the mountains and vineyards. Finally, bed down in Oude Werf, a boutique hotel in the heart of Stellenbosch. With its mix of period features \u2013 fireplaces, roll-top baths \u2013 and modern touches such as an outdoor pool, this makes the perfect base to explore the Winelands.\n\nHumpback whales, \u2018bunny chow\u2019 and golden beaches: why you should visit Durban Read more\n\nVine romance\n\nAfter a hearty breakfast of smoked Franschhoek salmon trout and peppered eggs at the hotel, it\u2019s time to hit the wine route. There are more than 100 wineries waiting just outside Stellenbosch, but the best have something more to offer than just a glass (or two). Elevate the experience by going to a chocolate and wine tasting at the Waterford Estate. Here, chief winemaker Kevin Arnold has teamed up with chocolatier Richard von Geusau, creating the perfect cocoa treats for guests. Then drive to Middelvlei Wine Estate for a plate of boere tapas (farmers\u2019 tapas) including snoek (a type of mackerel), pat\u00e9 and boerewors (farmers\u2019 sausage). Here, you can also enjoy a wine-blending experience, where you can make your own wine and get a personalised label to bring the bottle home. That\u2019s all your holiday presents sorted. And don\u2019t forget to thank your designated driver \u2013 they selflessly made it possible for you to enjoy all the wine on offer, after all.\n\nChocolate and wine tasting at the Waterford Estate (left); Eike restaurant\n\nDon\u2019t linger too long, as you\u2019ll want to be sober for your Segway tour of Spier Wine Farm, where you can enjoy the views of the mountains turning red at sunset. Park up at Oude Werf hotel then walk back to town for pre-dinner drinks at Craft Wheat & Hops (if you need a break from the vino) and then dinner at Eike on Dorp Street. Even if South African TV chef Bertus Basson isn\u2019t around, his 12-course tasting menu of nostalgic dishes such as bobotie (a South African moussaka) is a local celebrity in its own right.\n\nRoad trip\n\nGrab a croissant at the bakery/cafe Schoon Manufactory and then hit the road for one of the best drives of your life. The winding route from Stellenbosch to Franschhoek through the Helshoogte Pass is photo-opp central. You\u2019ll pass mile after mile of vineyards set against the towering Groot Drakenstein mountains. Once you\u2019ve had your picture fix, make your way into town for lunch at Foliage, where ingredients such as wild mushrooms and edible flowers are foraged from the valley, then check in to Leeu Estates. This hip hotel is nestled on the slopes of the Dassenberg with 17 rooms and an impressive art collection. Although you\u2019re surrounded by mountains and rolling vineyards, you\u2019re still just a three-minute drive from Franschhoek\u2019s pretty high street.\n\nThe Groot Drakenstein mountains; the Franschhoek Wine Tram; Leeu Estates\n\nPark the car and hop on the Franschhoek Wine Tram to La Motte \u2013 the beautiful grounds include an art gallery, a wine-tasting hall and an excellent restaurant. Don\u2019t miss Boschendal, one of the oldest wine estates in the country where you can sip their signature pinot noir and chardonnay blend under giant fruit trees. Complete your days of indulgence with dinner at the Haute Cabri\u00e8re at the Haute Cabri\u00e8re wine estate in the hills overlooking Franschhoek. It would be rude not to order the six-course taster menu with wine pairing \u2013 just be prepared for the owner to open the wine with a sabre.

It\u2019s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.\n\nHead to the whale watching capital of South Africa\n\nWhale watching at Hermanus\n\nHumpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline \u2013 keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September \u2013 when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers \u2013 and there\u2019s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you\u2019re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you\u2019ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.\n\nDive into the Serengeti of the sea\n\nA 40-minute trundle down the road, you\u2019ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley \u2013 a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white\u2019s favourite prey.\n\nOgle ostriches in Oudtshoorn\n\nOudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world\n\nIt\u2019s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you\u2019ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves \u2013 an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites \u2013 Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.\n\nBliss out on the water\n\nKnysna lagoon (left); Tsala Treetop Lodge\n\nHead almost due south towards the coast and you\u2019ll soon reach Knysna \u2013 a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you\u2019ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads.

Grace Wales Bonner, a much hyped designer who has dressed the Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it over 40 years ago.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bonner\u2019s collection drew heavily on the colours of the Rastafarian flag Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BFC/Getty Images\n\nLinley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto\u2019s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for Lovers Rock parties. The soundtrack \u2013 put together by Jamie XX \u2013 was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken.\n\nThe collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a poloneck \u2013 a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women\u2019s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling.\n\nThe red, gold and green of the Rastafarian flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner\u2019s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest \u2013 be it Lovers Rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie \u2013 into clothes that people want to wear.\n\nAfter the show, Wales Bonner \u2013 a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show \u2013 explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, \u201cinevitable\u201d because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father\u2019s experiences in London in the 70s. \u201cI was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,\u201d she said. \u201cI was looking at John Goto\u2019s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The show featured polonecks, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BFC/Getty\n\nThe 29-year-old designer saw a difference between that era and her own. \u201cI feel like there was an optimism and irreverence [then] which meant that you could sample and mix cultural references in a nonchalant way,\u201d she said. Wales Bonner\u2019s sterling work could perhaps encourage a new generation to do the same.\n\nLast year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFC/Vogue Fashion Fund prize \u2013 an investment of \u00a3200,000 \u2013 in May. The designer\u2019s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner\u2019s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand\u2019s cruise collection in April. She also partnered with Solange on a performance art happening, Devotional Sound, in New York.\n\nWales Bonner highlights the work of other people of colour excelling in their field. Recent posts on her Instagram include a clip of poet London Kwesi Johnson reciting his piece Inglan is a Bitch in 1980, Bowling paintings, and a notice of a talk between Wales Bonner and artist Theaster Gates, for his show at the Tate Liverpool. Scroll further down and you\u2019ll find musicians including Steve Lacy and Jorja Smith wearing her designs. It\u2019s perhaps part of a wider vision for the designer\u2019s label.\n\n\u201cIt is my ambition to build a brand that comes from a black cultural perspective and has the same authority, presence and impact as any esteemed European house,\u201d she said to Vogue in May. \u201cIn the long term, I want Wales Bonner to exist on that same level.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/06/whirlpool-hotpoint-recall-washing-machine-refund-replacement", "published": "2020-01-06T07:00:23", "title": "We want a refund for our unsafe Hotpoint washing machine", "text": "It has been recalled by Whirlpool but we have no idea how long a promised fix will take\n\nI have a Hotpoint WMBF 742 UK washing machine which is affected by the latest Whirlpool recall.

We have a deposit of about 10% saved up and can afford a 70% mortgage. Interest rates are low right now and that doesn\u2019t seem to be changing any time soon, so I am tempted to go with a higher mortgage and deposit, so we can own more of our property. People think I am crazy not to take advantage of the upper limit of the help-to-buy equity loan, but I hate the idea that the amount I could owe someone might keep rising (even though it could fall as well \u2026 but hopefully not). Am I being too conservative and naive? Should I take advantage of the equity loan?\n\nMW\n\nA I think you are right to be cautious about taking out the maximum 40% equity loan just because you can. You are also being sensible in wanting to own as much of your property as possible. And you are right that the main drawback of the help-to-buy scheme is that \u2013 assuming house prices keep rising \u2013 the amount you have to pay back to Homes England (which provides the equity loan) will also keep rising. Conversely, the amount you owe on a mortgage keeps going down because you are only allowed to take out a repayment mortgage \u2013 which can now have a term of up to 35 years \u2013 under the conditions of the help-to-buy scheme.\n\nAlthough the equity loan is interest-free for the first five years, if you haven\u2019t managed to pay it off by the start of the sixth year, interest payments on the equity loan will kick in. If you went for the maximum 40% equity loan on a property costing the maximum \u00a3600,000 in London, this would mean interest would be due on \u00a3240,000. Using estimates given in the help-to-buy guidance of the retail prices index, which determines the interest rate charged, this would mean an extra \u00a3350 a month to pay, with none of that going towards reducing the size of the loan. By year 10, you might have to pay \u00a3442 on top of your mortgage and the \u00a31-a-month fee you have to pay from the first year.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how you would cope if you wanted to move house. At the moment, help to buy is open to both first-time buyers and people moving home, so you can make use of the scheme to afford your next new-build home. From April 2021, however, help to buy will be available only to first-time buyers. So if you have to pay back 40% of the sale price of your home, there may not be enough left over to buy somewhere else without the external financial assistance help to buy provides."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2020/jan/06/crossword-roundup-how-the-fnese-became-a-sneeze", "published": "2020-01-06T09:56:48", "title": "Crossword roundup: how the fnese became a sneeze", "text": "A look back and forward in our pick of the best of the broadsheets\u2019 cryptic clues\n\nThe news in clues\n\nOver at the Financial Times, Velia slipped in a clue on the last day of 2019 that would not be welcome in 2020:\n\n8d/19d However, the conclusion of Brexit is in more doubt (6,8)\n\n[ wordplay: synonym for \u2018however\u2019 & last letter of (\u2018the conclusion to\u2019) BREXIT, both inside (\u2018in\u2019) synonym for \u2018more\u2019 ]\n\n[ THOUGH & T, both inside SECONDS ]\n\n[ definition: doubt ]\n\nSECOND THOUGHTS?

Repeated licking can remove the oily surface film that protects the lips from losing moisture, leading to lips cracking. The digestive enzymes in saliva can also irritate the lips.\u201d\n\nUse lip balm\n\n\u201cYou want a lip balm that has emollient properties, smoothing the surface of the skin and acting as an occlusive agent, locking in moisture,\u201d says the cosmetic dermatologist Sam Bunting. \u201cI like lanolin and petroleum, which do both. If you are skiing or hitting the beach this winter, you\u2019ll want the addition of SPF, as lips burn easily.\u201d Reapply lip balm every few hours and before bed, \u201cas many of us with colds will mouth-breathe during sleep, which is very drying\u201d.\n\nConsider supplements\n\nSome medication, such as isotretinoin \u2013 better known under the brand name Roaccutane and used for the treatment of acne \u2013 can cause dry lips. \u201cA recent paper showed that gamma linoleic acid [an oil found in plants] and evening primrose oil supplements may improve the quality of the skin on the lips while taking isotretinoin,\u201d says Glass, but he adds that it is not clear if these supplements would help people not taking the drug. It may be worth a try.\n\nWatch what else you\u2019re using\n\n\u201cLip balms can sometimes contain ingredients such as camphor and menthol, which create a pleasant, tingly \u2018active\u2019 sensation when applied,\u201d says Bunting. \u201cBut they can irritate, leading to lips, paradoxically, getting drier with use, so I don\u2019t recommend them. And if you use actives-based skincare, such as retinol, be sure to barrier off the lips with lip balm before applying it at night to avoid flaky, irritated lips.\u201d Some lipsticks can also be drying.\n\nExfoliate and moisturise\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t confuse a recurring cold sore with chapped lips. And don\u2019t ignore a non-healing scab \u2013 lips are a common site for skin cancer so get your GP to refer you to a dermatologist for further assessment,\u201d recommends Bunting. If your lips do become dry and chapped, Glass explains they \u201ccan be effectively treated by gentle exfoliation to ensure you are removing any dry, flaky skin from the surface and regularly moisturising with a good quality lip balm or moisturiser\u201d."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/red-meat-diet-modern-vegetables-lack-nutrients-fightback-veganism", "published": "2020-01-05T08:58:56", "title": "Red meat plays vital role in diets, claims expert in fightback against veganism", "text": "As millions cut out animal products, farming conference hears that fruit and vegetables have been drained of nutrients\n\nAdvocates of red meat will begin a fightback against the growth of veganism this week at the UK\u2019s biggest farming conference, with claims that eating lamb and beef is vital because some plants and fish are being drained of their nutrition.\n\nIn a speech at the Oxford Farming Conference, Alice Stanton will tell ministers, farmers and environmentalists that key nutrients in some fruits, vegetables and grains have dropped by up to 50% over 50 years.\n\nStanton, professor of cardiovascular pharmacology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said nutrition levels had dropped because farmers were trying to meet a demand for cheap food. \u201cFor plant-based foods, there\u2019s been drops in vitamins and key electrolytes by up to 50% over the past 50 years because of the genetic selection for large volume and uniformity of shape and appearance, so the things look good on the shelves. There hasn\u2019t been selection for nutrient content,\u201d she told the Observer.\n\nGrowing interest in veganism and flexitarianism \u2013 people trying to eat less meat \u2013 led to a drop in sales of red meat last year of about \u00a3185m, according to market researchers Nielsen. Research for veganuary, which promotes plant-based diets on health and ethical grounds, showed that more than 1.3 million people gave up animal products in January 2019. Retailers and food companies have launched thousands of products aimed at vegans \u2013 nearly a quarter of all launches had a vegan claim, according to Mintel \u2013 including Gregg\u2019s vegan sausage roll, vegan BBQ ribs and vegan smoked salmon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against vegetarianism or veganism,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cIt is possible to have a balanced diet with vegetarianism. It\u2019s a little bit more challenging but still possible with veganism. However, it requires a lot of knowledge and effort, which doesn\u2019t happen in the majority of the population. People don\u2019t have time to invest in getting a really balanced diet through a range of plant-based foods.\u201d\n\nLast year, the EAT-Lancet Commission, a group of 37 leading scientists, said that people in Europe and North America should reduce red meat consumption by about 80%, allowing for one beefburger and two servings of fish per week. Stanton said she \u201ctotally agreed\u201d with its proposal for people to eat more pulses, nuts, fruits and vegetables.\n\nProfessor Stanton is right that a global shift in diet from meat to plant-based food won't be easy \u2026 but it's absolutely necessary Anna Jones, Greenpeace UK\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, we need to address greenhouse gas emissions. But I\u2019m concerned about the dramatic reduction in red meat consumption being regarded as the solution,\u201d she said. Eating red meat in moderation \u2013 \u201ctwice to four times a week\u201d \u2013 was \u201cprotective against heart attacks, strokes and cancer\u201d, while nutrients in red meat were vital for children in the first three years of life, she added.\n\nStanton said plants were not the only foods declining in nutrional value. Studies also that show omega-3 fatty acid levels in Scottish farmed salmon have also dropped by half.\n\nWill Jackson, of the livestock industry body AHDB, echoed Stanton: \u201cThe key message is balance. Different food groups work best when consumed together in moderation as part of a \u2018balanced plate\u2019 approach.\u201d\n\nVegan advocates suggest buying organic food. \u201cOrganic producers often use more heritage strains of vegetables and grains that have not undergone as much selective breeding as more commercial strains,\u201d said Toni Vernelli from the organisation Veganuary.\n\n\u201cAlso, eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains to ensure you are getting a range of nutrients as well as an array of interesting tastes and textures.\u201d\n\nAnna Jones, a forestry specialist at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cProfessor Stanton is right to point out that a global shift in diet from meat to plant-based food won\u2019t be easy and isn\u2019t a solution on its own, but, given the impact of the meat industry on the climate, it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/us-citizens-in-iraq-tell-us-about-your-situation", "published": "2020-01-03T14:16:57", "title": "US citizens in Iraq: tell us about your situation", "text": "We\u2019d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

But his artistic response to the forced sterilisation programme he underwent in Nazi Germany, a bundle of leaves flimsily held together in a worn leather cover, is receiving growing recognition in the art world almost eight decades after his death.\n\nThe detailed sketches, like scenes from a puppet show, are believed to be the only works of art by one of the 400,000 people who suffered forced sterilisation under the Nazis\u2019 programme to eliminate \u201cundesirables\u201d.\n\nThe sketch book is to be the focal point of a major permanent collection of so-called outsider art \u2013 at the Prinzhorn gallery in Heidelberg, southern Germany from May.\n\n\u201cThese drawings are immensely precious both historically and artistically,\u201d says Thomas R\u00f6ske, art historian and director of the Prinzhorn, which owns Werner\u2019s drawings in its collection of 6,000 works by patients of psychiatric institutions, dating back to 1840 and the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\u201cMost work produced by patients was destroyed during the Nazi period,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pencil drawing by Werner.

He is like the director of his own awful play.\u201d He included two sketches in a show he curated at the Lightbox in Woking, The Outside and the Inside. The works of Werner have a particular poignancy, he says, viewed in the context of the many pieces of art by institutionalised artists that are often destroyed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pencil drawing by Werner. Photograph: Prinzhorn gallery\n\n\u201cI worked at a care centre in Brighton 30 years ago where I was struck by the artistic intuition and talent of those who came there.

It is only due to strict German bureaucracy that the scantest of details about his life are known.\n\nBorn on 18 September 1898, he was without a profession, unmarried, Catholic and diagnosed with idiocy. Analysis of his drawings suggest he was probably left-handed. But there is no birth certificate, no photograph and his medical file has been lost, probably destroyed. There is only the registration number HHSTAW Abt.631a, Nr 1645, assigned to him at the age of 42, when he was in a group of 143 people \u2013 mainly women \u2013 who were transported to Pirna Sonnenstein asylum near Dresden on 6 October, 1940 and murdered in its gas chambers as part of the Nazis\u2019 \u201cAction T4\u201d extermination programme.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pencil drawing by Werner.

It\u2019s clear that drawing was his world and he had developed a style and had inhabited that world for a long time.\u201d\n\nBerlin recreates Nazi-baiting art exhibition from 1938 Read more\n\nThe drawings show scenes from the clinic, including meetings between doctors and nurses. Round clowns depict the patients as they undergo surgery or juggle testicles. The nurses smoke, with swastika bands around their arms as they handle the patients\u2019 testicles. Twice, Werner refers to a Dr Weinzierl. Hans Weinzierl was head surgeon in a hospital in Schweinfurt where compulsory sterilisations were carried out, even though there is no evidence that he was involved. Although the artist\u2019s sympathy is clearly with the patients, the pictures are often ambiguous, R\u00f6ske says, with \u201cthe authority figures exuding an air of matter-of-fact authority\u201d.\n\nWerner also depicts sterilisation as a literal castration, R\u00f6ske says, whereas the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring only stipulated that patients should be made infertile. \u201cBut he seems to have understandably viewed the surgery as a brutal emasculation,\u201d R\u00f6ske says, \u201chence his frequent use of the motif of removed testicles and drawings of the sterilisation instruments, as he imagined them.\u201d\n\nIn arguably his most striking drawing, entitled The Triumph of Sterelation (as he referred to sterilisation), R\u00f6ske says it is still not clear to him if Werner was \u201cmaybe being sarcastic or trying to develop a humouristic fantasy about suffering for a \u2018good cause\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe drawing shows inmates of the clinic being transported on a bus decorated with swastika flags while on its roof a nurse displays two testicles on a plate. \u201cHe might well have been aware of the propaganda vehicles that drove through Nazi Germany advertising the party\u2019s slogans and could well have been referencing them,\u201d R\u00f6ske says.\n\nOn the inside of the book cover, Werner refers to himself as an \u201corator of the people\u201d and a \u201ctheatre director\u201d.\n\nSteene says: \u201cIt\u2019s rather wonderful. He knew that he was speaking up for so many back then.

Tucked behind, up a slight hill, where the buildings become bare brick and the tarmac road turns into a dust track, people sit on the ground in the afternoon sun, talking and playing cards.\n\nThese are the Roma, or the Roma who remain in Hungary, where they live on society\u2019s edge, clinging on in the outskirts of towns and villages, shunned and stigmatised as potential criminals.\n\nMany have left, seeking a better life elsewhere in Europe, often in the UK. Poor and marginalised, they are easy pickings for traffickers who post adverts on Facebook promising a bright future for those prepared to travel.\n\nMany have succumbed to the temptation. A lot of young people have gone to the UK to work, say the people playing cards. One man who gives his name as Kalman says his 27-year-old sister has gone to Britain, to marry a Turkish man she had never met.\n\nAn older man says many of his relatives have gone too.

The sister thought she\u2019d simply have a better life. Sabrina\u2019s husband emerges and shouts to her to come away from the gate.\n\nLondon, Manchester, Sheffield, Bolton, Leeds, Bristol \u2013 these are some of the cities where people have heard they can make money. The line between economic migration and exploitation is ill-defined: some who travel are aware of the risks but prepared to take a chance, others think they are off to start a better life only to end up in modern slavery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Agnes De Coll of Hungarian Baptist Aid: \u2018It usually starts with some kind of promise of a better life\u2019 Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt usually starts with some kind of promise that it is going to a better life,\u201d says Agnes De Coll, head of anti-trafficking for Hungarian Baptist Aid, an NGO working with the country\u2019s police. Young women in particular are vulnerable to traffickers who befriend them with promises of romance. \u201cMost of the times they are afraid of the cities, they don\u2019t know the language, they live in the rented apartment where they are doing the sex work and they don\u2019t know anything better.\n\n\u201cIt is so frightening for someone coming from a village. It is shocking. That\u2019s why they stay, because they are so afraid. It makes them even more vulnerable, more attached to the pimp.\u201d\n\nBaptist Aid can get about 40 or 50 a year into shelters and help maybe another 100 more, but thousands of Hungarians are in similar positions around Europe. Jobs are advertised on Facebook, she says. One girl answered an advert for a babysitter. At the interview she was taken in a car to Slovakia and kept for two weeks until other girls arrived and then they were taken to the UK.\n\nThey were told they could choose to be a prostitute or the wife of someone from a developing country. That girl escaped, she says, but blackmail is a problem. \u201cThere is usually a money-lender in the villages where the Roma live on the edges of towns and villages and they are always blackmailing the families every day, asking for more and more.\n\n\u201cSometimes they make the family work without pay to work off their debt and after a while they figure that if there is a young daughter in the family they can get rid of the debt. They threaten them with all kinds of things.\u201d\n\nRachel Harper, helpline manager for the UK anti-trafficking charity Unseen, says it has picked up dozens of cases of exploitation. \u201cTraffickers know where to find vulnerable individuals and how to target them, including online,\u201d she says. \u201cCases of modern slavery, across various types of exploitation, have been reported to the Modern Slavery Helpline where the potential exploiter initially contacted the potential victim, recruited them or exerted control via social media.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maria was a UK sex worker. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/Guardian\n\nIon answered an advert on Facebook promising work and housing, but he reached the UK to be told he owed his trafficker money. He was threatened with violence, the wages he earned from a factory job taken from him.\n\nMihai thought the advert he saw on Facebook would lead to a proper factory job, but he ended up picking vegetables for less than minimum wage, threatened with violence, even murder, kept in cramped accommodation and allowed no freedom.\n\nMaria Szuda stands in the darkness outside her apartment in the town of Orosh\u00e1za, 200km south-east of Budapest, drawing heavily on a cigarette, her face lit by the glow of her phone as she scrolls and then points at the screen \u2013 a Facebook page, post after post of adverts for work in or travel to the UK.\n\nFacebook was where her 32-year-old daughter Ivett was recruited. She has been in jail since January when a British jury convicted her and her husband Karl Ring, 34, of controlling the prostitution of women trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation.\n\n\u201cTen floors of whores\u201d, a tabloid headlined the case: a London apartment block in Chelsea where Hungarians were brought in to work as prostitutes.\n\nThe court heard they used low-cost airline Wizz Air to fly the women in before forcing them into sex work. Szuda had worked as a prostitute herself, the judge said, before marrying Ring - a former client.\n\n\n\nIvett Szuda may not have been an innocent abroad, despite her mother\u2019s protestations to the contrary, but researchers investigating trafficking from Hungary to the UK say many are and that social media has a key role in recruitment. The UN and European commission both list the UK as a major destination for Hungarians trafficked into labour exploitation. Other countries, notably Germany, the Netherlands and France, have higher rates of sexual exploitation but the UK is becoming an increasingly important destination.\n\nThe European commission\u2019s Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings document describes Hungary as \u201cprimarily a source and transit country for women and girls subjected to trafficking for sexual exploitation and for men and women for trafficking for labour exploitation\u201d. It is not an ethnic problem \u2013 there are both Roma and non-Roma \u2013 more one of poverty, poor education and high unemployment, says Hungarian trafficking expert Viktoria Sebhelyi.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest VIktoria Sebhelyi blames poverty, poor education and high unemployment. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/The Guardian\n\nCurious about the role of social media in recruitment, Sebhelyi teamed up with child psychologist Dora Varga-Sabj\u00e1n to create a Facebook profile purporting to be that of a 16-year-old Hungarian girl. They suspected that the platform was being used by people involved in trafficking to groom vulnerable young women who did not have a strong family network.\n\nThe character they created was described as living in care and new to Facebook. They had her join some popular groups and sat back to watch what happened next. Within two weeks the profile was contacted by 116 people \u2013 108 men and eight women, aged from 19 to 65.\n\nPeople added her to other closed groups. She was put in secret makeup and haircare groups where recruitment was going on. The men tended to open with a compliment \u2013 \u201cHi, I like your eyes\u201d \u2013 even though the researchers had only posted an avatar.\n\n\u201cI just want to make new friends. Is it okay? I don\u2019t want anything more. I just want to understand you.\u201d\n\nThe researchers replied politely, making clear that the \u201cgirl\u201d was under the age of 18 and asking if that was OK. Of course, they told her. Don\u2019t worry.\n\nThen they asked more questions, probing for weaknesses. \u201cDo you have a good relationship with your parents? Do you have a lot of girlfriends? How close are you?\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long \u2013 sometimes just a couple of chats \u2013 for the subject to turn to sex. Some men talked about sex after only two brief chats. There were naked pictures and questions about her own sex life. In the closed groups, there were leading questions.\n\n\u201cHow did you get that look, did your parents buy it? No? Oh, your parents are dead, oh that\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\nIt was clear, says Sebhelyi, that these were the same methods used in trafficking: the identification of a vulnerable target and then the grooming.\n\nTwitter\u2019s own rules prohibit the promotion of adult sexual content globally, including pornography, escort services and prostitution, though the existence of the #escort hashtag seems to fly in the face of this policy. Facebook forbids the publication of content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities.\n\nThe challenge for anyone trying to prevent recruitment through Facebook or Twitter posts is the speed at which they appear and disappear and, as Sebhelyi notes, the ease with which victims can be drawn into private groups away from public scrutiny. The Facebook page Maria Szuda was looking for was one of the largest UK forums for Hungarians - Legnagyobb Info Oldal Nagy-Britanni\u00e1ban.\n\nAn array of messages advertise jobs and services, including people arranging travel to the UK. Most will be honest: spotting rogue ads is virtually impossible. But there are other less innocent sites publicly visible. One of the largest advertisers of sexual services in Hungary - red-life.net - has a Facebook listing redirecting to its website, where sex work is advertised both in Hungary and abroad, including the UK. Red-life is also on Twitter.\n\nThe Lyuk\u00f3 valley, on the edge of the north-eastern industrial city of Miskolc, is not a place where the government takes care of people, says Andrew Turro, a coordinator with the Roma self-government. The old mining area is filled with shacks, interspersed with a few more substantial houses. There are green hills and fruit and vegetable gardens, horses and carts, old cars and farming machinery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Lyuk\u00f3 valley, where exploitation is widespread. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/Guardian\n\n\u201cPeople prefer to live in the UK. They have work and a decent living and it is better than Hungary because they are not targeted as much,\u201d he says. One man says his daughters are working in the UK, but he doesn\u2019t know what they are doing. They\u2019re working as prostitutes, says Turro, as he tries to get the attention of a neighbour whose husband is away taking people to the UK, mostly women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends working abroad,\u201d a younger woman says. \u201cDuring the past four years a lot of people have left here. There\u2019s very little money that people can make here.\u201d\n\nMany children grow up thinking they want to work abroad, but they don\u2019t end up happy, she says. Istv\u00e1n and his daughters went to the UK with a middleman. He worked in construction, they danced in a club near Manchester and had sex with men in the rooms above. Their employers held their passports and stopped them leaving.\n\nProstitution is regarded as a practical route out of poverty, even if it is exploitative, says Gabor Varady, leader of the Roma minority self-government in Miskolc. \u201cThere is a certain sorrow that for family or economic reasons these girls are forced to do this. No one would want to do this, it is a last straw, it is not a pensionable job.\n\n\u201cBut someone working as a prostitute in the UK will make as much in a month as I do in half a year. How do you tell them to stop?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/06/sleepwalking-into-2020-media-missed-donald-trump-rise-lessons-learned-2016", "published": "2020-01-06T10:00:26", "title": "Sleepwalking into 2020: are the media who missed Trump's 2016 rise ready now?", "text": "In the weeks after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the American media went through deep soul searching.

Then there was Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and an arguable failure to appreciate the importance of misinformation and Russian interference in the election.\n\nThis time the press has pledged to do better.

Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMargaret Sullivan, media columnist for The Washington Post: The press is under assault and democracy is under assault right now, and these two things are related. One of the things we didn\u2019t do well covering the presidential election last time was that we failed to distinguish between the serious and not so serious \u2013 the term false equivalency comes to mind. So Trump and his sexual assault claims, business record, history of racism \u2013 all those things were made equal to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Today we\u2019re calling it a little better. When things are \u201cracist\u201d we\u2019re willing sometimes to use that word. We\u2019re willing to use the word \u201clie\u201d. We\u2019ve come a ways in that sense, but I\u2019m still not particularly positive about how we\u2019re going to deal with 2020.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times: In 2016 I think the media got the country wrong. I don\u2019t think we got Trump. We didn\u2019t understand how much the country was angry at elites, upset about the fallout from the economic crisis. And I don\u2019t think we understood quite how much the country just wanted to shake things up. We covered it as usual, the way we always cover elections, as a clash of two ideologies, and I think it was much, much deeper.\n\nBen Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News: The media has this incredible quadrennial habit of learning all the lessons of four years ago and applying them when the medium has already moved on. So I think the media is totally prepared not to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle, like giving Trump endless livestreams and letting him use provocative tweets to dominate the conversation. But I\u2019m sure we will fuck it up in some new way we aren\u2019t expecting.\n\nIn 2020 there will be 32 million Latinos eligible to vote and I\u2019m concerned the story might repeat: Latinos stay home.

He has convinced a third of the country that the New York Times is fake news. We can criticize the Times all we want for substantive reasons, but it\u2019s not fake news. We have to have some general understanding: outlets like the Guardian, the New Yorker, these are not fake news!\n\nJorge Ramos, Univision news anchor: In 2016 there were 27 million Latinos eligible to vote and 13 million of them decided to stay home \u2013 more than 50%. In 2020 there will be 32 million Latinos eligible to vote and I\u2019m very concerned that the story might repeat itself again: that Latinos decide to stay home because they don\u2019t like President Trump but don\u2019t trust the Democrats either. That would be terrible for Latinos.\n\nDaniel Arnall, executive editor, MSNBC: So one of the things that we are doing differently than in the last cycle is focusing more on issues, and coverage of issues that folks across the country are interested in. That is going to be driving our coverage. We\u2019re going to be substantially less interested in taking like live candidate events, I think, and dealing with all of that.\n\nTrump tweet coverage is low-hanging fruit. Samhita Mukhopadhyay, executive editor of Teen Vogue\n\nCharlie Sykes, editor-in-chief at The Bulwark: Going back to 2016, when I was part of what you\u2019d consider to be the conservative media, it\u2019s difficult to remember that there was still a lot of diversity of opinion. There were a lot of conservative commentators and talk show hosts who were very critical of Donald Trump. What\u2019s really changed is how increasingly tribalized the media has become.\n\nKara Swisher, tech journalist and founder of Recode: What happened in 2016 should not come as a surprise for anyone who has been paying attention to the tech companies.

Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nFrank Bruni, columnist, the New York Times: We\u2019ve learned that if you write a story about the ridiculousness of Trump\u2019s latest tweet it gets a lot more traffic than an analysis of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Medicare for all plan. Trump understands what news catches people\u2019s interest, he has a very acute sense of what people will click on. So I\u2019m concerned that we are going to end up giving Trump more than the lion\u2019s share of media time all the way up to election night.\n\nMukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: We are living amid constant cutbacks. Outlets are shrinking. I worry the story continues to be driven by what is performing, by KPIs (key performance indicators). That\u2019s where a lot of the Trump tweet coverage comes from \u2013 it\u2019s low-hanging fruit.\n\nSusan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today: I make no apology for the amount of coverage we give President Trump. He\u2019s the president. If he says something that\u2019s incredibly provocative or does something that has far-reaching ramifications, we have an obligation to report it.\n\nRamos, Univision: When Trump announced his candidacy in 2015 and when he ejected me from a press conference, we told everyone, listen, this is someone who\u2019s making racist remarks, he\u2019s attacking the press, yet very few people pay attention. Today I believe it\u2019s a completely different story. Journalists are being much more aggressive than they were in 2016.\n\nSmith, BuzzFeed: This is a totally different moment to 2016 \u2013 it\u2019s an election that will be a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency. The challenge will be covering his presidency and not what he says about it.\n\nOlivia Nuzzi, Washington correspondent for New York Magazine: Trump is sort of blowing everything up. And the way he has done that has provided more opportunity for reporters to be creative. In the Trump White House, nothing works like it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nJust one Trump speech will have 60 false and misleading claims \u2026 It\u2019s incredibly depressing. Glenn Kessler, editor of The Fact Checker, Washington Post\n\nBaquet, The New York Times: When you cover a theatrical politician you must try not to get caught up in the theatre.

And that\u2019s in part what is feeding the sense of polarisation and people living in two entirely ecosystems in the US.\n\nLies, damn lies and fact checking\n\nSince Trump took office, the Washington Post has counted 13,435 of his false and misleading claims.

Photograph: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nGlenn Kessler, editor of The Fact Checker, Washington Post: The database of Trump\u2019s false claims is a very depressing duty. It just drags you down to have to go through it, like reading one of the president\u2019s rally speeches. Just one speech will have 60 false and misleading claims, most of which you\u2019ve already fact-checked and said were false. It\u2019s incredibly depressing.\n\nPage, USA Today: There is much more impressive fact-checking than there was in 2016. One of the things that we\u2019ve seen happen is not to let something that we know is inaccurate stand unchallenged.\n\nWe can talk about it and help voters identify what is true and what is not. Nicholas Johnston, editor in chief of Axios\n\nRamos, Univision: I\u2019ve covered Latin America for many decades and I think that has prepared me for what I\u2019m seeing right here in the US. To have someone leading the country who is an authoritarian, who is not telling the truth, who\u2019s constantly lying in a country that is completely divided.\n\nBruni, the New York Times: You can only say the same thing so many times before people become numb and deaf to it. If the public is not listening, I don\u2019t know how that becomes our fault.\n\nNicholas Johnston, editor in chief of Axios: What makes me somewhat optimistic is that four or six years ago we didn\u2019t even have the vocabulary to talk about deep fake, fake video and audio, misinformation, the manipulation of social media, the end of truth. Now we know that these are things, we can talk about it and help voters identify what is true and what is not.\n\nKessler, Washington Post: I\u2019ve covered just about every presidential administration since Reagan and this administration has the least fidelity to truth and honesty of any I\u2019ve encountered.\n\nAll of us in the media were just so convinced Trump couldn\u2019t win. Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times\n\nSullivan, The Washington Post: The Sunday TV talk shows will bring on people like Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s White House counsel, who is just an inveterate liar. By having her on, she is allowed to say things that aren\u2019t true and although she can be challenged it\u2019s still a very strong message having her on air. My feeling is, don\u2019t have her on, you know she\u2019s going to lie her way through every broadcast. That\u2019s not censorship. Censorship is government action that disallows things being said, but judgments made by editors and producers are not censorship.\n\nSwisher, Recode: If you\u2019re not scared when Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg says it\u2019s okay for politicians to lie, especially in the context of a system that is so viral compared to any other media, you should be afraid.\n\nPolling\n\nMost opinion polls in 2016 predicted that Hillary Clinton would win. On election day the New York Times gave Clinton an \u201c85% chance to win\u201d through its forecasting model. There\u2019s been a lot of soul-searching since then. Have we learned the lessons?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 2016 election night watch party at La Plaza de Cultura y Artes in Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nArnall, MSNBC: I am still hesitant on polling, and I think there\u2019s been a real reluctance by a lot of major organizations to really come to terms with the failures of that through the last cycle. I think that\u2019s a potential weak point that a lot of people should be pushing their organizations on. I\u2019m still like, \u2018What are we doing differently this time?\u2019.\n\nLarry Sabato, pollster and director of University of Virginia Center for Politics: All of us pollsters got to eat a large, bitter, humble pie after election night in 2016, which came as a tremendous shock. We\u2019d all expected Hillary Clinton to win by three points or so, giving her over 300 electoral college votes. When Trump won we were forced to relearn that polling is not the word of God or handed down on the Mount to Moses.\n\nBaquet, the New York Times: All of us in the media were just so convinced Trump couldn\u2019t win. But he was outside of the paint-by-numbers game we have developed.\n\nDiscussions about whether Elizabeth Warren is likeable enough reflects inherent sexism we haven\u2019t dealt with. Margaret Sullivan, media columnist for The Washington Post\n\nSabato, pollster: The polling industry has tried to correct itself after it was so badly caught off-guard. We used not to weight by educational level and it turned out that if we had done so we might have been more accurate in 2016. So now everybody is weighting by education. We also had our fingers burned over the electoral college. The polls got the popular vote more or less correct, with Clinton winning the popular vote by two percentage points, but we should have thought more about the profound electoral college impact that gave Trump his victory.\n\nPage, USA Today: You have to rely both on quantitative and qualitative interviews. Polling is really valuable, but it doesn\u2019t tell you everything. You want some quantitative data that enables you to say, \u201cHey, Pete Buttigieg is doing really well among older voters,\u201d which is one thing we\u2019ve just noticed in recent polling, then go out and talk to older voters.\n\nSabato, pollster: As for forecasting models, they need to be dropped entirely. Most readers didn\u2019t understand what probability really means. It just confuses people, and to do it again next year would be to plant a bomb that could explode in your face.\n\n\u2018Horserace coverage is dead\u2019\n\n2016 provoked soul searching about whether Clinton was held to different media standards than Trump, both in the extent and type of coverage. Is the same happening again within the traditional media obsession with the horserace?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Trump rally in Sunrise, Florida on 26 November 2019. Photograph: Jayme Gershen/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBruni, the New York Times: Here\u2019s one specific way I think we will be able to judge whether we\u2019ve done our jobs well at the end of the 2020 election: we will not have gone to the Democratic finalists in the primary stage or to the ultimate Democratic nominee, whoever that person is, every time Trump hurls an insult and accusation at them. We will not have made that the main news story of the day: \u201cCandidates traded volleys in a war of words.\u201d We do that all the time.\n\nSullivan, the Washington Post: I see sexism in the coverage of women candidates. It\u2019s improved since Hillary Clinton ran but it\u2019s still not great. The disappearance of Kamala Harris has some of that wrapped into it, and the constant discussions about whether Elizabeth Warren is likeable enough to be elected reflects inherent sexism that we haven\u2019t really dealt with.\n\nPage, USA Today: On the day that Donald Trump announced, my assumption was that he was not going to be nominated for president. And it took a while for me to realize what voters were saying, which was that he would be. So that is a lesson that I think we tried to apply this time, by looking at the Democratic field \u2026 It\u2019s not up to us. It\u2019s up to voters.\n\nMukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: One thing we\u2019re seeing with young people is that they are having trouble following the deep nuances between candidates. It\u2019s kind of boring to really point out some of these policy differences because they\u2019re not really that different.\n\nSmith, BuzzFeed: Horserace coverage is dead. Our audience actively hates it. We have to think about a way to replace it in a way that is compelling and that cares about the personalities and the policies while always keeping in mind that there are real things at stake. Now it\u2019s kids in cages. I mean, who cares that somebody fires his political consultants.\n\nHire people who actually live in the midwest. Sarah Kendzior, St Louis, Missouri-based journalist\n\nZanny Minton Beddoes, editor in chief of The Economist: We are beefing up our data department, which we\u2019ll combine with traditional shoe-leather reporting. We plan to put those together with the outsider perspective we bring, and the ability to stand back from the tick-tock of the horserace minute-by-minute, to give rigorous fair-minded analysis.\n\nSmith, BuzzFeed: For our audience nobody thinks that politics is a game or that it\u2019s fun or a sport. The kind of coverage that treats it as though it\u2019s entertainment is repellant to people. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to know who\u2019s going to win or that they don\u2019t care about polling, but just that everybody has a sense of what the stakes are. That\u2019s the brand for our coverage: the stakes 2020.\n\nFly-over country\n\nTrump\u2019s unexpected victory four years ago led to questions about whether media organisations, in their coastal bubbles, had failed to hear the frustration of voters in the heartlands. How is it playing for 2020?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Voters fill out ballots in Janesville, Wisconsin on 14 August 2018. Photograph: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBaquet, the New York Times: We have to get out in the country more. We have to talk to more people, which we\u2019ve started to do.\n\nSarah Kendzior, St Louis, Missouri-based journalist and author of The View from Flyover Country: Dispatches from the Forgotten America: National media is making the same mistakes as in 2016. The midwest has become the sort of stand-in region for what the national media think of as the \u201cforgotten voter\u201d. What a lot of these coastal outlets are doing is parachuting in here with the narrative pre-written trying to find people who fit their preconceptions of what people in the midwest are like. Honestly the best way they could fix this problem would be to hire people who actually live in these states.\n\nAl Cross, director of the University of Kentucky Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues: It\u2019s not just boots on the ground. You can\u2019t have a parachute mentality. You have to have some appreciation of rural sensibility. The best reporters know how to do that.\n\nSykes, The Bulwark: I\u2019m in Wisconsin and I do a lot of work on the coast as well. I\u2019ll be on an MSNBC show, and people on the panels start talking about Wisconsin voters as these strange throwback figures, \u201cnostalgic for a time when men were able to slap women around\u201d. And it was like, \u201cWait, no.\u201d First of all, understand that these are people who have their own values, their own communities, and every time you talk about them in this way, you deepen this red, blue divide, this thing. You need to not treat them as these \u2026 deplorable troglodytes.\n\nCaitlin Byrd, political reporter, Charleston Post and Courier: Growing up in the south, you see the same descriptors used to talk about places where I was from: Backwoods, dirt road, small town, quiet. The same tropes over and over. But this cycle is it seems that more national reporters in particular are realizing that the south is more complicated.\n\nNone of the presidential candidates have a very well-fleshed-out strategy for Gen Z. Samhita Mukhopadhyay, executive editor of Teen Vogue\n\nGitlin, Columbia University: There was a sense after 2016 that we weren\u2019t listening to enough people in diners in Ohio. That wasn\u2019t so much misguided as it was inflated. The average Trump voter has above-average income! News media went from not noticing people whose life chances are impacted by the rustification of the midwest to thinking that they are now the central story. It\u2019s an absurd overcompensation.\n\nKendzior: I meet a lot of people who have some regret about voting for Trump, who are reluctant at times to admit that regret on record. Some are embarrassed about having made this regrettable decision \u2026 The base is still there, they\u2019re very frenetic \u2026 But I do think that base is much smaller than the media portrays it.\n\nReaching young voters\n\nOnly 46% of 18-29 year olds voted in 2016. Was the failure of media to address young people\u2019s interests partly to blame, and if so how to fix it?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hillary Clinton takes a selfie during a 2016 rally in Des Moines, Iowa. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: The way the media talks about the youth vote is as social media Snapchat-obsessed young people, who don\u2019t care about politics and are not engaged because it\u2019s above their head and they are so selfish and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t vote. If I was Gen Z that kind of narrative would turn me off too. When you do have outlets that speak to their interests you notice that they do become engaged.\n\nSwisher, Recode: When I started my podcast, someone said to me, \u201cYou know, Kara, millenials like snackable content.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to write for people who want snacks. Everyone who\u2019s substantive wants substance.\u201d They said, \u201cMillenials are twitchy. They can\u2019t focus on anything long.\u201d And what\u2019s interesting about it is, they were dead wrong.\n\nMany news organisations have started calling Trump a racist \u2013 that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t happen in 2016. Jorge Ramos, Univision news anchor\n\nMukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: None of the presidential candidates have a very well-fleshed-out strategy for Gen Z. Nobody really knows how the 18-year-old who is in S Louis who works in a fast food place, we have no idea what they want. We don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to vote. At Teen Vogue we see it as an opportunity for a generation that has not had somebody actually speak to their needs: climate change, immigration, juvenile justice, student debt.\n\nRace in the race\n\nDiversity in media \u2013 both in terms of the internal makeup of news teams and the way those teams cover Trump\u2019s stoking of racial fears \u2013 will be a running theme in 2020.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An attendee at a rally for Kamala Harris in Oakland, California. Photograph: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nErrin Haines Whack, national writer on race and ethnicity, Associated Press: As we head into 2020, I am still on the campaign trail quite frequently the only black woman in a room. Sometimes the only black person. The reality is that two thirds of the people who cover political journalism are white men. Yet we have the most diverse field in the history of Democratic politics in the upcoming primary: a record number of women, a record number of people of color. Responding to that diversity in newsrooms seems to be a journalistic imperative.\n\nDwight Watkins, Salon editor and bestselling Author: I\u2019ve been seeing the same people \u2026 get out there and basically tell similar stories and make assumptions about whole groups of people. They talk about the black vote as if it\u2019s just one thing. So I think when you utilize the same players and the same people, they take their biases and they apply these biases to our whole group. And this is just not fair.\n\nRamos, Univision: Many news organisations have started calling Trump a racist \u2013 that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t happen in 2016. When Trump said in June 2015 that Mexican immigrants are criminals and rapists, that was a racist statement but many people were not comfortable calling him out on that. Since then he\u2019s made many other racist remarks and reporters and news media feel more comfortable now in calling Trump a racist.\n\nBaquet, the New York Times: People who think that Trump only won because 40% of America is racist are not looking closely at the numbers, and do not have a fully empathetic understanding of America. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t stoke racism and get votes from racists. But that\u2019s a very easy answer. I don\u2019t think that journalists should deal with easy answers.\n\nDelete your Twitter account and don\u2019t use that as your window on the world. Nicholas Johnston, editor in chief of Axios\n\nMukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: I felt a lot of the conversations after 2016 were \u201cOh no! we focused so much on getting all these women in the newsroom we alienated all these white men\u201d. After the election, editors felt they needed less diverse newsrooms because they were concerned they had gone \u201ctoo far left\u201d or had incorporated identity politics too much and were alientating this white base that was all riled up for Trump.\n\nRamos, Univision: The numbers of Latinos represented in the US \u2013 whether in newsrooms or in Congress \u2013 are abysmal. We don\u2019t have enough Latinos on the air or reporting. I do see changes. The first presidential debate among Democratic candidates was organised by NBC and Telemundo, and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart was one of the moderators. That alone meant that Spanish was spoken in that debate, immigration was addressed and Hispanic issues were talked about. I was one of the moderators in the second debate, and for the first time not only did we talk about Latino issues and immigration but I brought in Latin American issues.\n\nEscaping the Twitter bubble\n\nWhere will 2020 election news come from?

Okay, that\u2019s a joke \u2013 we are not going to un-invent the internet. But I do think it\u2019s important in newsrooms to talk about the impact that it has. We tell our reporters to call people on the telephone, get out of the house, go wander the halls of Congress, fly someplace and talk to people.\n\nMukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: If you looked at Twitter after the recent Democratic presidential debate, my entire timeline was filled with criticism of Pete Buttigieg. Meanwhile he\u2019s polling really well. That discrepancy reminds me of that we thought Trump couldn\u2019t win in 2016 because we all hated him and thought he was a joke. That to me indicates that we haven\u2019t learned anything.\n\nNuzzi, New York Magazine: I try to remind myself that the entire electorate is not represented in these couple hundred Twitter accounts.\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/windermere-children-arek-hersh-survivor-bbc-drama", "published": "2020-01-05T11:00:01", "title": "From Nazi camps to the Lake District: the story of the Windermere children", "text": "In 1945, hundreds of children liberated from concentration camps were flown into a tiny town in the Lake District to begin new lives. On the eve of a BBC dramatisation of their story, 91-year-old survivor Arek Hersh talks about the experience\n\nOn the morning of 14 August 1945 towards the end of the second world war, 16-year-old Arek Hersh and 300 other Jewish children boarded a squadron of 10 converted Stirling bombers and took off from Prague. They were organised in groups of 30 to each aeroplane, with 15 sitting on each side on the floor. Hersh remembers it vividly: \u201cThey cut us some bread,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought it was cake. They gave us each a piece and it was great.\u201d About eight hours later, they landed at RAF Crosby-on-Eden, near Carlisle.\n\nThe children were the first intake of a pioneering rehabilitation scheme, in which boys and girls from labour and concentration camps in eastern Europe were transported to the Lake District to find new families and start afresh. Their journey has been dramatised by the screenwriter Simon Block and the result is a timely and moving BBC film The Windermere Children, starring Thomas Kretschmann and Romola Garai, to be shown this month, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nAt 91, Hersh is spry with a mischievous sense of humour. For almost half a century, he spoke to no one about his Holocaust experience. Not to his three daughters, who are old enough now not only to have kids of their own but also grandchildren. Nor to Jean, his second wife, whom he married in the early 1970s. Eventually, around 1995, Hersh decided to write it all down. The words came excruciatingly slowly. \u201cTwo lines a day,\u201d he recalls, when we meet at his comfortable home just north of Leeds. \u201cBut I wrote it, and then after that I could speak, I could talk about it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I was very, very lucky\u2019: Arek Hersh, Holocaust survivor, photographed at his home near Leeds. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nBefore the war, Hersh \u2013 Herszlikowicz back then \u2013 lived with his parents, brother and three sisters in Sieradz, a garrison town in west Poland. His father was a bootmaker, much in demand for making officers\u2019 footwear. When the Nazis invaded, they came first for Hersh\u2019s father, but he escaped; they came back for his brother, but he also slipped away. That left 11-year-old Arek, who was packed off to a labour camp near Poznan to lay lines and sleepers for the Poznan-Warsaw railway, which would speed up the German attack on the Soviet Union. One of his responsibilities was to clean the room of the camp commandant, who every day would leave Hersh a hunk of bread on his desk. It wasn\u2019t much, but Hersh believes it saved his life. \u201cWe started with 2,500 men,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin 18 months, there were only 11 of us left alive. And I was one of them. Very, very lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuck\u201d is a word that comes up again and again in Hersh\u2019s account. When he was sent to Auschwitz in 1944, he told the SS officer that he was 17 and a locksmith. He wasn\u2019t either of those things; he just wanted to suggest that he might be useful to the Nazis. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I said, and they told me to go to the right side,\u201d says Hersh. \u201cAnd 180 children all went to the wrong side. And they were murdered.\u201d\n\nThe most gruelling experience for Hersh personally, however, came in the early months of 1945, when he was evacuated first on foot, in the bitter cold, to the Buchenwald camp in Germany and finally to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia on what he calls \u201cthe train of damnation\u201d. \u201cA whole month on open wagons without food,\u201d says Hersh, shaking his head. \u201cWe ate grass. I ate the leather on my left shoe to keep going. I didn\u2019t swallow but I chewed it.\u201d\n\nYour first instinct is to try to think your way into their heads. But you realise that\u2019s impossible Simon Block, screenwriter\n\nHersh was in Theresienstadt, expecting any moment to be killed, when the camp was liberated by the Russian army on 8 May, 1945. He was moved on to Prague and it was here he was selected for the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, which was set up by the British philanthropist Leonard Montefiore, a leading figure in the Anglo-Jewish Association. Montefiore persuaded the British government to accept 1,000 displaced children aged eight to 16; the Home Office agreed on condition that the funds were found by the Jewish community. In the end 650 boys and 80 girls came over.\n\nWhat kind of physical and mental shape must these children have been in? How do you begin to repair the damage done to individuals, who in many cases were the only surviving members of large families? How do you try to imagine what they might be thinking? These were the questions that faced the therapists and educators at Windermere who were to help them in August 1945. It was also a quandary for the team behind the new drama.\n\n\u201cYour first instinct is to try to think your way into their heads,\u201d says Simon Block. \u201cBut you realise that\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t imagine what Arek, who was in four different concentration and labour camps including Auschwitz, went through. And not just for a day, but for years. You can\u2019t recreate that trauma; all you can do is reflect how their behaviour may have manifested some of that while they were at Windermere.\u201d\n\nHersh turns up the electric fire a notch and Jean walks in with a tray of tea, biscuits and cake, and instructs me with brisk hospitality to tuck in, because her husband will probably forget. On the walls are photographs of Hersh with the Queen, Prince Charles and Liza Minnelli. \u201cOh yes, she dedicated a song to me one time,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter landing at Crosby-on-Eden, Hersh and the other children were driven to the Calgarth estate in the village of Troutbeck Bridge. A mile from Windermere, it was a wartime housing scheme that had been used for workers from the Short Sunderland aeroplane factory, which had relocated there to evade the bombing. Dormitory accommodation was provided as well as single rooms for older boys, like Hersh. \u201cEach one had a bed, a chest of drawers,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was everything you needed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Survivors today, with the actors who play them in The Windermere Children (left to right): Chaim \u2018Harry\u2019 Olmer, Kacper Swietek, Arek Hersh, Tomasz Studzinski, Pascal Fischer, Ben Helfgott, Marek Wroblewski, Sam Laskier, Kuba Sprenger, Ike Alterman. Photograph: Helen Sloan/BBC/Wall to Wall/ZDF\n\nThe Windermere programme is not as well known as the Kindertransport initiative, which moved nearly 10,000 mostly Jewish children from Nazi-occupied territories to Britain between 1938 and 1939. At that time, some British politicians, including former prime minister Lord Baldwin, argued that it was a humanitarian duty. \u201cI have to ask you to come to the aid of the victims, not of any catastrophe in the natural world, not of an earthquake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut of an explosion of man\u2019s inhumanity to man.\u201d\n\nBlock sees clear parallels with today\u2019s migrant crisis. \u201cWindermere is a story of refugees and child refugees,\u201d he says, \u201cand I thought it was very pertinent considering what was going on at the time [in Calais] when we started working on it.\u201d\n\nIn 1945, the immediate priorities for the children were to get clothing and find out about their families. The Red Cross supplied clothes, but they were odd shapes and sizes, so many children walked around in their underwear for a few days until donations of garments from local families started arriving.\n\n\u201cWe started to live as normally as we could,\u201d remembers Hersh. \u201cSome kids brought us bicycles and they said, \u2018Go on, have a ride!\u2019 We didn\u2019t understand what they were saying, but they gave us a bicycle. So we went on the main road, and we were cycling on the right-hand side, so they tooted the horn like mad, shouting from the cars. We didn\u2019t know what they were shouting at us. We couldn\u2019t speak one word of English! But we caught on quite quickly, and we went to the cinemas, sixpence per seat, and it was very nice and we made our own life and things were OK.\u201d\n\nNews of their families took time to trickle through. For some there was hope, even something close to a miracle. There is a powerful moment in The Windermere Children when one of the children is reunited with a long-lost brother, who he has been told has probably died. That really happened. \u201cOh, it would be incredibly manipulative to have made that up,\u201d says Block. \u201cNo, if you have that, you wouldn\u2019t need to make anything up.\u201d\n\nFor most though, including Hersh, there was only despair. He found out his mother had been gassed and thrown into a mass grave at the Chelmno extermination camp. Of his immediate family, only his older sister Mania had survived, having escaped to the Soviet Union. There is a scene in the drama where Hersh \u2013 all the children, are played by Polish actors \u2013 hears about the fate of his family and soon after breaks up with his girlfriend. \u201cI still had so much grief,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI had lost my whole family and I felt I couldn\u2019t worry about my girlfriend as well.\u201d\n\nAt the Calgarth estate, the children received no counselling. Instead, they were encouraged to swim in the lake, play football, and given basic English lessons. \u201cThe thing about therapy obviously is that it\u2019s only any use if somebody wants to engage with it,\u201d says Block. \u201cAlmost the main point was to bring them together in one place where they could be with other people who\u2019d been through what they\u2019d been through, talk about it among themselves if they wanted to.\u201d\n\nThat was certainly Hersh\u2019s experience. \u201cThere were three or four boys I had been with in Auschwitz and Buchenwald,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were always together. So I could talk to them, because they had a similar story to mine, but not to anybody else.\n\n\u201cWe just had to suffer,\u201d he goes on. \u201cTerrible. I had about 30 years of nightmares. Middle of the night, I used to get a nightmare and so on.\u201d It was only after he had completed his book, A Detail of History, in 1998, he says, that he finally began to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s left me now. After I wrote the book actually, it left me then.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A portrait of Arek Hersh taken when he was \u2018about 18\u2019 in Liverpool after the war. Photograph: \u00a9 Arek Hersh/The Observer\n\nThe Calgarth estate programme was designed to be a temporary scheme, running for four months, after which, the younger children would be placed in the care of foster families, and the older ones would live in hostels and prepare for work. Hersh moved first to Liverpool with his friends and then Manchester. He trained as an electrician, but eventually, living in Leeds after marrying Jean, he bought and let property, mainly to students. Somewhere along the line, in the 1950s, he shortened his name from Herszlikowicz, because he was fed up with having to spell it out.\n\nBlock, who also wrote the 2015 BBC drama The Eichmann Show about the trial of Adolf Eichmann, interviewed a dozen Windermere survivors and found that most of them were \u201cvery eager to get on with life\u201d. He continues, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t bury what happened to them completely because it would come back in their sleep, in their subconscious, but they wanted families and all the rest of that. It was when they retired and they had more time to reflect that it all came barrelling back to them.\u201d\n\nHersh is now involved in education, at schools and universities, and with the charity March of the Living, which each year organises a walk between the Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps. In 2009, he was awarded an MBE. \u201cWhen I first went back to Auschwitz, it was awful for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get through the gate. But after three attempts I got through and since then I\u2019ve been going there with children and young people to show them the place.\u201d\n\nThese visits are clearly still not easy \u2013 why does he put himself through it? \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want people to think that it just happened many moons ago, and people forgot about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI talk to everybody, so young people know that what actually happened to me can happen to anybody. That\u2019s the main reason I do it.\u201d\n\nBlock found that this idea of giving something back is a recurring theme. \u201cThe Windermere children are the most patriotic people I\u2019ve ever come across,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re so grateful for the chance they got to start their lives again in the UK, and they want to express that in many ways, by being successful here and paying taxes and raising their families here.\n\n\u201cHopefully viewers will think, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not impossible to bring people here and help them rather than be scared of those who might be fleeing from terrible experiences.\u2019 We can bring them in, help them and then that\u2019s repaid many times over.\u201d\n\nThe Windermere Children will be broadcast on BBC Two later this month.\n\nOn 27 January, Holocaust Memorial Day 2020 will mark 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.

This particular site in Beckton is next to the busy A1020 and just across the river from London City airport.\n\nThe mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz, was also at the event and said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing that we\u2019re working with charities like Trees for Cities, because it\u2019s bringing focus to the resident population here in Newham about the importance of nature, ecology and tree planting, but also its contribution in response to the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Elliott, Trees for Cities chief executive, plants a seedling with his children. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian/Observer\n\nRecent analysis from the British Heart Foundation has found the borough to be the most polluted in the UK, and its council last year declared a climate emergency. Yet while the environmental benefits are obvious, they don\u2019t reflect the joy many young people experience on getting involved in tree planting.\n\n\u201cWhen we work on big estates, for example, you get young people coming out and engaging with stuff that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to do. It\u2019s very powerful, actually,\u201d says Elliott.\n\nJackson Pereira from nearby East Ham is at the event with his family, including his young daughters, Amelia and Ava, and nieces, Harshini and Lassyhani. He says there aren\u2019t many woodland areas near their home for the kids to run around in, so he\u2019s keen to contribute to creating more green spaces for children in cities to enjoy and learn from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said to them, \u2018When you\u2019re Daddy\u2019s age, and you come back here, it will look totally different.\u2019 Amelia has already said she\u2019s going to mark her tree and she wants to climb it once it\u2019s high enough.\u201d\n\nThere are many children attending from local beavers and other scout groups, benefiting from an experience they can\u2019t get in a classroom. Harshini, aged seven, says: \u201cNow we know we shouldn\u2019t waste paper and we know how hard it is to grow a tree.\u201d\n\nThe family hopes the event will make a lasting impact on the youngsters, like it did for Yanis, who was 13 when he attended a Trees for Cities planting session in Seven Kings Park, in the neighbouring borough of Redbridge, last year. He enjoyed it so much he joined the Orchard Leaders club at his secondary school, through which he planted trees every Friday after school on a nearby field.\n\n\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t really want to go, I just wanted to sit at my computer, but as I went on I realised that it\u2019s a very important problem, and also it\u2019s actually very enjoyable,\u201d he says.\n\nHis mother, Bego\u00f1a Belmonte, said she was proud of her son: \u201cHe did it over the winter period, as well. Which is very commendable because of the cold and the wet.\u201d The next tree planting session in their area is scheduled for March. \u201cI really loved the experience of being involved with Trees for Cities, and I wish there were more local projects we could participate in.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jackson Pereira, centre, and members of his family. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian/Observer\n\nMost volunteers agree the best thing about these events is being able to turn serious concern over the climate crisis towards a productive end. Elliott says: \u201cI suppose the beauty of tree planting is it\u2019s a real practical thing and you can see, from the beginning to the end of the day, the difference you\u2019ve made. Hopefully those trees will be there for hundreds of years, helping to constantly improve the environment. We\u2019re offering something which is really tangible.\u201d\n\nFor Abbas Ali, a 24-year-old auditor who lives in Canary Wharf, it\u2019s a welcome opportunity to spend time out among nature, meeting other people. \u201cI think that\u2019s something everyone misses when they live in London \u2013 it\u2019s a breath of fresh air,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t participate in Extinction Rebellion because it\u2019s a bit intense. So this is something that I care about and it\u2019s also a really good way to spend your Saturday. I would probably just be watching TV otherwise.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future, Elliott says the main focus of Trees for Cities will be training and empowering the next generation of young people, whether individuals or community groups. \u201cWe want to give them the motivation, the ideas, the resources and knowhow to go out and start taking ownership of their local spaces, doing tree planting and greening projects themselves.\u201d\n\nVolunteer supervisor Glen is one of those young planters keen to do her bit to help save the planet. \u201cThere are so many different things that need to come together to tackle such a big problem,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice to feel like you are doing something towards helping.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Guardian and Observer\u2019s climate emergency appeal ends at midnight on 12 January"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/iran-us-diplomacy-possible-qassem-suleimani-killing-avoid-war", "published": "2020-01-05T20:03:32", "title": "Diplomacy over Iran is still possible \u2013 if only to avoid an all-out war", "text": "Tehran has vowed revenge for the killing of Qassem Suleimani but conflict is not yet certain\n\nDiplomacy over Iran is still possible \u2013 if only to avoid an all-out war\n\nThe threats emanating from Twitter feeds and podiums in Tehran and Washington might suggest the moment for diplomacy has long passed, and some form of war between the US and Iran following the assassination of Qassem Suleimani is now inevitable.\n\nThe only consideration that might hold the two sides back is the possible consequences. Tehran has tasted the unpredictability of Donald Trump and however much the desire for revenge beats in the hearts of Iranians, European leaders are pleading with Tehran\u2019s leadership, saying it has a responsibility to use its head and recognise any direct attack on US assets in the Middle East is likely to be met with a further escalation by Trump.\n\nA number of European diplomats privately say it is notable that among the chants of \u201cdeath to America\u201d, some Iranian military leaders have spoken more cautiously about a response, stressing it will occur at a time and on a target of Iran\u2019s choosing. For the past year, Tehran has conducted attacks on the US and its allies through plausible deniability, using proxies and militias. A full-frontal assault on Washington by the Revolutionary Guards would be suicidal. The US has about 60,000 troops in the region, including about 5,200 in Iraq.\n\nThose sums may give diplomats the narrowest window of opportunity to try to de-escalate the crisis. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, is heading to the US on a pre-arranged visit and will press the White House to think more strategically about its involvement in the Middle East. Many in the Pentagon will be privately urging the same.\n\nThe EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has also invited the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to Brussels, and it is possible Tehran will take up the offer. The EU has been rightly criticised in the past for being insufficiently active in the Middle East.\n\nThere are also lines of communication open to Tehran via Oman, Japan or through the Swiss embassy \u2013 the formal conduit for communications between Tehran and Washington.\n\nIran may also calculate that it has political as well as military avenues to pursue for long-term advantage.\n\nIt is already a posthumous victory of sorts for Suleimani that the Iraqi parliament has voted to support the expulsion of US troops. Many of Suleimani\u2019s years of political work in Iraq were spent trying to build up pro-Iranian forces, and Iran\u2019s politicians will press the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to quickly enforce parliament\u2019s will. It speaks volumes that he felt compelled to take part in the tributes paid to Suleimani in Baghdad against a backdrop of anti-American slogans.\n\nPlay Video 1:30 Massive crowds attend funeral processions as Suleimani's body is returned to Iran \u2013 video\n\nMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has claimed Iraqis responded to the assassination of Suleimani by dancing in the streets, but the assassination has weakened anti-Iranian forces in Baghdad, including the nationalist protesters in Tahrir Square opposed to Iran and the US using Iraq to fight out their geopolitical battles.\n\nRestraint by Tehran now might strengthen pro-Iranian factions in Iraq as fresh efforts are made to find a new prime minister. A more pro-Iranian mood may also sweep through other capitals in the Middle East as public opinion recoils at Trump\u2019s threats.\n\nIt was notable for instance that Qatari leaders rushed to Tehran to convey their support, even though tens of thousands of US troops are stationed in Qatar. Equally, both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the two Gulf states closest to the US, have issued very cautious remarks about the killing of Suleimani. Saudi Arabia stressed it had not been consulted about the drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nFull-throated support for the US would not only make these countries possible targets for Iran, but also inflame domestic opinion. Lines of communication, often indirect and faltering, have been opening between Iran and Saudi Arabia for months, and while it is too early to talk of a thaw, Tehran now has cards to play with Riyadh that it did not previously possess. There has rarely been a US president less capable of cultivating public opinion in the Middle East. The threat to destroy Iranian cultural sites will leave allies in the region queasy.\n\nIran will also work the court of legal and public opinion over the legality of the drone strike that killed Suleimani. Even Raab did not quite condone Trump\u2019s actions, saying instead that he understood them and condemning Suleimani\u2019s efforts to destabilise the region.\n\nBut Iran is not well suited to the moral high ground. The political mood will demand some form of retribution and response. The fifth and final step announced by Tehran away from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers includes ceasing to recognise any operational restrictions on its civilian nuclear programme. It also means an end to restrictions on centrifuges.\n\nSome will say Tehran\u2019s announcement marks the effective end of the nuclear deal, but by allowing continued independent inspections and not pushing the levels of uranium enrichment to 20%, the continuing European signatories to the agreement can still monitor Tehran\u2019s compliance. As such, it is possible to interpret Iran\u2019s position as wanting to engage with European nations and not put them in the same category as the US.\n\nBut a new gesture by France, Germany and the the UK to keep the deal alive may be required. Tehran has persistently claimed European efforts to increase trade with Iran have been limited.\n\nEmmanuel Macron failed in the autumn at the UN general assembly to bring about a reconciliation between Trump and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. The French president proposed a three-month pause in US sanctions and, in return, a renewed Iranian willingness to renegotiate the nuclear deal as part of a broader settlement.\n\nThe chances of reviving such a complex proposal in the current climate look extremely slim. Indeed, the only force moving in diplomacy\u2019s favour is that the alternative might be an all-out conflict."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2020/jan/05/starlings-ice-sculptures-and-a-18m-tuna-the-weekends-best-photos", "published": "2020-01-05T14:33:40", "title": "Starlings, ice sculptures and a \u00a31.4m tuna: the weekend's best photos", "text": "Pasto, Colombia A singer takes part in the city\u2019s Blacks and Whites carnival, which has its origins in a mix of Andean, Amazonian and Pacific cultural expressions\n\nPhotograph: Ra\u00fal Arboleda/AFP via Getty Images"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/05/big-picture-tom-hegens-alluring-abstract-salt-landscape-aerial-photograph", "published": "2020-01-05T05:30:52", "title": "The big picture: Tom Hegen\u2019s alluring abstract salt landscape", "text": "Ever since you could take a camera up in a hot-air balloon, there has been a fascination with photographing the Earth from the air.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questioned if President Donald Trump\u2019s reasons for the Qasem Soleimani assassination was to distract from impeachment.\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think that the question that we ought to focus on is why now? Why not a month ago, and why not a month from now? And the answer from the administration seems to be that they can\u2019t keep their story straight on this. They pointed in all different directions. And you know, the last time that we watched them do this was the summer over Ukraine. As soon as people started asking about the conversations between Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine and why aid had been held up to Ukraine, the administration did the same thing. They pointed in all directions of what was going on. And of course, what emerged then is that this is Donald Trump just trying to advance Donald Trump\u2019s own political agenda. Not the agenda of the United States of America. So what happens right now? Next week, the president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he is deeply upset about that. I think that people are reasonably asking why this moment? Why does he pick now to take this highly inflammatory, highly dangerous action that moves us closer to war? We have been at war for 20 years in the Middle East, and we need to stop the war this the Middle East and not expand it.\u201d\n\nTapper asked, \u201cAre you suggesting that President Trump pulled the trigger and had Qasem Soleimani killed as a distraction from impeachment?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cLook, I think that people are reasonably asking about the timing and why it is that the administration seems to have all kinds of different answers. In the first 48 hours after this attack, what did we hear? Well, we heard it was for an imminent attack, and then we heard, no, no, it is to prevent any future attack, and then we heard that it is from the vice president himself and no, it is related to 9/11, and then we heard from president reports of people in the intelligence community saying that the whole, that the threat was overblown. You know, when the administration doesn\u2019t seem to have a coherent answer for taking a step like this. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, a step that puts everyone at risk, and step that puts the military at risk and puts the diplomats in the region at risk. And we have already paid a huge price for this war. Thousands of American lives lost, and a cost that we have paid domestically and around the world. At the same time, look at what it has done in the Middle East, millions of people who have been killed, who have been injured, who have been displaced. So this is not a moment when the president should be escalating tensions and moving us to war. The job of the president is to keep us safe, and that means move back from the edge.\u201d\n\nTapper pressed, \u201cDo you believe that President Trump pulled the trigger on this operation as a way to distract from impeachment? Is that what you think?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think it is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration immediately after having taken this decision offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what is going on.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it is the right question to ask. We will get more information as we go forward but look at the timing on this. Look at what Donald Trump has said afterward and his administration. They have pointed in multiple directions. There is a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago and not a month from now, not a less aggressive and less dangerous response. He had a whole range of responses that were presented to him. He didn\u2019t pick one of the other ones. He picked the most aggressive and the one that moves us closer to war. So what does everybody talk about today? Are we going to war? Are we going to have another five years, tens, ten years of war in the Middle East, and dragged in once again. Are we bringing another generation of young people into war? That is every bit of the conversation right now. Donald Trump has taken an extraordinarily reckless step, and we have seen it before, he is using foreign policy and uses whatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/warren-questions-if-soleimani-strike-linked-to-impeachment-look-at-the-timing/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "U.S. Service Member, Two Contractors Killed in Kenya Jihadist Attack", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A jihadist attack on a military base in Kenya killed three people Sunday, including a US service member and two civilian defense contractors, the American military said.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of our teammates who lost their lives today,\u201d General Stephen Townsend, the head of US Africa Command (Africom), said after jihadists from Somalia\u2019s Al-Shabaab group stormed a base in the Lamu region.\n\nTwo other Department of Defense personnel were wounded in the attack on Camp Simba, Africom added in a statement which gave no details on the identity of those killed.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/01/05/u-s-service-member-two-defense-contractors-killed-in-kenya-jihadist-attack/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Golden Globes Host Ricky Gervais: Hollywood in No Position to Lecture About Anything.

In 2018, less than 3.8 million babies were born in the U.S. \u2014 a drop of two percent, or almost 64,000 births, since 2017.\n\nThe total fertility rate, which stands at 1,729.5 births per 1,000 women, remains below replacement level \u2014 the number of births needed to at least replace a generation of Americans.

These children, often referred to as \u201canchor babies,\u201d immediately obtain American citizenship and anchor their illegal or foreign parents in the country.\n\nIn addition, about 72,000 anchor babies are born to foreign tourists, foreign visa workers, and foreign students every year \u2014 all of whom obtain immediate American citizenship simply for being born within the parameters of the country.\n\nAltogether, about 372,000 anchor babies are estimated to have been born last year despite a commitment by Trump to sign an executive order ending the nation\u2019s \u201canchor baby policy\u201d that incentivizes pregnant migrant women to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in the hopes of securing American citizenship for their children.\n\nThis indicates that there were more anchor babies born in 2019 than births in each of the 50 states except California and Texas.

Jared Golden (D-ME) risks alienating both Republicans and Democrats with his decision to only back one article of impeachment against President Donald Trump.\n\nRep. Golden became the only Democrat to split his decision on whether to impeach President Trump by deciding to vote for one article of impeachment charging that Trump abused the office of the presidency while voting against the other article of impeachment charging the president with obstructing Congress.\n\nBy voting for only one article of impeachment, the New York Times contended that the Maine Democrat will appeal to Maine\u2019s independent voting bloc, even though it may alienate Republicans and Democrats who seek lawmakers who toe the party line.\n\n\u201cIt might be a lonely place for me to be in Washington,\u201d Rep. Golden told the Times. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a lonely place for me to be here in Maine, and in my district.\u201d\n\nRep. Golden ousted incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME) during the 2018 midterm elections by less than one percent, making Maine\u2019s second congressional districts one of the many potential congressional districts Republicans could retake during the 2020 congressional elections.\n\nHowever, in a more polarized country, many Maine politicians contend that Golden\u2019s strategy to appeal to Maine\u2019s independent voters may alienate both the larger voting populace.\n\nFormer Maine Republican senator William Cohen, who was one of the first Republicans to support impeachment of then-President Richard Nixon, said, \u201cThe split is much deeper than ever before, and the people who cross the lines are penalized.\u201d\n\nKiernan Majerus-Collins \u2014 the chairman of the Lewiston, Maine, Democrats \u2014 said, \u201cI have not seen a single conservative or Republican voter who said, \u2018I really appreciate that you only voted to impeach Trump on one count rather than two.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his claim to remain somewhat politically independent, Golden admitted, \u201cI vote with the Democratic Party like 88 percent of the time. That\u2019s, I think, a perfect way to step back and compare it to past Congresses and see how truly divided and partisan Congress has become \u2014 that I\u2019m now one of the standout members.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were automatically going to this cynical place of, \u2018This young freshman thinks he can get away with pleasing both sides,\u2019\u201d Golden added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand he\u2019s about to get run over by a Mack truck that\u2019s coming right down the middle of the road.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/01/05/new-york-times-jared-golden-risks-alienating-democrats-republicans-impeachment/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Mort Klein: New York\u2019s \u2018Bail Reform\u2019 Makes Jews Unsafe", "text": "New York\u2019s \u201cbail reform\u201d is giving \u201cget out of jail free\u201d cards to alleged hate crime perpetrators, allowing them to attack others.\n\nCase in point: the release, without bail, of Tiffany Harris \u2014 twice in three days \u2014 after Harris\u2019s initial arrest for an alleged unprovoked attack on a group of Jewish women in December. Her case exemplifies the flaws with New York\u2019s Bail Elimination Act (NY Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 510.10 et seq.), which went into effect on January 1st.\n\nHarris first made the news after she allegedly attacked three young Orthodox women in Crown Heights, Brooklyn on Friday morning, December 27. Harris reportedly confessed to the police officers who arrested her: \u201cYes, I slapped them. I cursed them out. I said \u2018F-U, Jews.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe day after her arrest, the Brooklyn Criminal Court released Harris without bail, reportedly under pressure to comply with the forthcoming New York Bail Elimination Act.\n\nOne day later \u2014 on Sunday, December 29 \u2014 Harris was again arrested \u2013 this time for allegedly attacking a woman who was walking with her 3-year-old son and baby daughter in Brooklyn. The victim was reportedly Jewish. Yet once again, the court released Harris the next day, without bail.\n\nAnd once again, within a day Harris allegedly assaulted a social worker during a court-mandated meeting \u2013 Harris\u2019 third alleged crime in just five days. She was finally kept in custody for psychiatric evaluation.\n\nNotably, Harris\u2019 alleged attacks occurred during a gruesome week in which Jews were attacked repeatedly in New York: between December 24 and January 1, there were 13 assaults on innocent Jews.\n\nWe cannot hope to stamp out the current plague of antisemitic attacks when attackers are immediately released back to the streets.\n\nThe flawed New York bail system was a risk to public safety even prior to the new Bail Elimination Act. The Vera Institute of Justice (a liberal group dedicated to eliminating cash bail) explained (emphasis added):\n\nNew York was, and remains, the only state in the country that precludes judges from taking into account any consider- ation of public safety when setting bail or imposing pretrial detention. Until the 1970s, all bail statutes only considered failure to appear. With the advent of \u201ctough on crime\u201d rhetoric and policies, several states began to amend their bail laws to in- clude a consideration of risk to public safety. In 1984, Congress passed the Federal Bail Reform Act, which introduced public safety in the federal bail system and survived a constitutional challenge in United States v. Salerno.7 Since then, 49 states, all except New York, have changed their bail laws to allow judges to consider both risk of failure to appear and public safety in pretrial decisions.\n\nNew York\u2019s Bail Elimination Act exacerbated the prior risks in New York. The Vera institute calls New York\u2019s new provisions \u201ctransformative\u201d because it reduces the traditional discretion of the courts.\n\nThese \u201ctransformative\u201d new provisions include:\n\n(1) Mandating that the police must simply issue an appearance ticket (a summons) to most people charged with misdemeanors and Class E felonies, some of which are violent felonies.\n\n(2) Mandating release for a wide swath of offenses, and requiring judges to jump through hoops to impose restrictions on defendants. New CPL [Criminal Procedure Law] \u00a7 500.10.1 provides that (emphasis added): \u201cIn all such cases [where a future court appearance may be required], except where another type of securing order is shown to be required by law, the court shall release the principal [arrested person] pending trial on the principal\u2019s own recognizance, unless it is demonstrated and the court makes an individualized determination that the principal poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution. If such a finding is made, the court must select the least restrictive alternative and condition or conditions that will reasonably assure the principal\u2019s return to court. The court shall explain its choice of release, release with conditions, bail or remand on the record or in writing.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s mandated release is unusually lenient. Every other state\u2019s bail reform law merely require courts to consider a \u201cpresumption\u201d of release for most offenses.\n\n(3) As noted above when a condition on release is imposed, the judge is required to impose the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions on release that will \u201creasonably assure\u201d the arrested person\u2019s return to court. Further, the use of electronic monitoring is extremely limited. (See CPL \u00a7 500.10.3-a)\n\nImposing the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions that \u201creasonably assure\u201d a return to court is far less protective of the public than the previous standard. New York law previously provided that \u201cthe court must consider the kind and degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure his [the defendant\u2019s] court attendance.\u201d (Prior CPL \u00a7 510.30.2(a).)\n\nIn all likelihood, fewer defendants will show up at their court hearings under the new standard, which does not impose conditions \u201cnecessary\u201d to secure court attendance.\n\n(4) Requiring judges to consider a person\u2019s \u201cability to post bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his or her ability to obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond.\u201d (CPL \u00a7 510.30.) When bail is imposed, judges are also required to set at least three or more forms of bail, one of which must be an unsecured or partially secured bond. An \u201cunsecured bond\u201d only requires payment if and when someone fails to show up for court, and offers far less incentive to return to court than paying bail prior to the court date does.\n\nThe previous version of CPL \u00a7 510.30 already required courts to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cemployment and financial resources.\u201d The law thus already addressed the \u201cbail system favors the rich\u201d argument.\n\nThe new \u201cability to pay without undue hardship\u201d requirement invites manipulation of the system.\n\n(5) When a defendant fails to appear for his court date, the new law now requires judges to give defendants a 48-hour grace period to voluntarily appear prior to issuing a bench warrant. (CPL \u00a7 510.50) This potentially leaves defendants who pose a risk to the public in the community even longer.\n\nWhat are the solutions?\n\nFirst, New York needs to reconsider its refusal to consider danger to the public when making bail determinations.\n\nProperly crafted laws can take danger to the community into account in bail and bail denial determinations. In United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld taking into account in bail determinations the arrestee\u2019s dangerousness, for specific serious offenses where Congress found that arrestees were likely to repeat the offense if released, where the arrestees were provided with due process protections, including probable cause, and a full-blown adversary hearing.\n\nSecond, at a minimum, New York should amend its Bail Elimination Act so that the courts are not required to give mandatory desk tickets and mandatory release to the perpetrators of hate crimes. New York\u2019s new \u201ccapture and release\u201d system fails to take the plague of antisemitic hate crimes seriously.\n\nThird, we need to return to a system that sets bail at an amount \u201cnecessary to secure\u201d defendants\u2019 return to court. The victims and potential future victims of antisemitic hate crimes deserve no less.\n\nIf the New York State legislature is sincere about stopping the antisemitic crime wave plague on New York\u2019s streets, the legislature must immediately fix this new flawed system.\n\nMorton A Klein is president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA.

U.S. District Court of Appeals that would allow for the effort by congressional Democratic.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCongressman, thanks for staying with us. Now, I want to talk about \u2014 and I\u2019d love to stay with Iran, but I don\u2019t have that much time.\n\nI want to talk to you about impeachment. So Pelosi impeaches the President, so to speak. I\u2019m not quite sure if she did or didn\u2019t because it\u2019s still in the House, and it hasn\u2019t been transferred to the Senate.\n\nSo they were in a rush these Democrats. We\u2019re going to get it done by the end of the year. We\u2019re going to get it done by Christmas. They get it done by Christmas, and they\u2019re slow to give it over to the Senate. What is going on? Do you know?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I think Nancy Pelosi thinks she has more power than she does. Once she names the managers, it will go to the Senate.\n\nBut an interesting thing happened just yesterday in the U.S. District Court of Appeals inside D.C. Pelosi\u2019s House Attorney, Douglas Letter made the argument before a judge that they could offer another Article of Impeachment.\n\nThis is the only thing the Democrats\u2019 agenda is to try to impeach this President. Al Green has said it. You\u2019ve heard it from so many other Democrats. It is their only goal of what they\u2019re continuing to try to do. Their case is so weak.\n\nI think part of the Speaker\u2019s problem is she doesn\u2019t want to show it over to the Senate, because bipartisan they\u2019ll vote against it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPIRRO: Wait, wait, OK \u2014 you\u2019ve got to stop there. She wants to add another Article to the two Articles of Impeachment that we don\u2019t even know if our Articles of Impeachment because they\u2019re just in limbo right now, without a vote? She wants to add another, that\u2019s like me \u2014\n\nMCCARTHY: That is an argument. That is what hurt \u2014\n\nPIRRO: Go ahead.\n\nMCCARTHY: \u2014 her attorney made that argument in a Court of Appeals in D.C. yesterday before a judge when the judge questioned why are they even asking for this? It dealt with the Mueller Report because impeachment is over.\n\nAnd he says, could there be another impeachment? He said, yes. Nancy Pelosi has signed off on that. We could go to a third Article of Impeachment. They have nothing else on their agenda.\n\nWhile this President is taking terrorists out and making America safer. They\u2019re trying to take the President out. They will not put America first by far.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPIRRO: This is outrageous. This is outrageous. OK, all right. Let\u2019s follow this through, OK? Because this is infuriating. And it\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of it. I don\u2019t think anybody said this so far.\n\nSo here you\u2019ve got this woman in a rush to get impeachment. They get it done by the end of the year. Now the thing is in limbo. She goes to a court that\u2019s like me indicting someone for petty larceny, and then saying, hey \u2014 after the grand jury voted \u2014 I\u2019m going to indict him for murder, too, judge, let\u2019s just throw that in there. What the heck? We don\u2019t need an indictment (ph) \u2014 we don\u2019t need to vote on it.\n\nBut the more important is the fact that right now, she says that she doesn\u2019t want to send it over until she is sure it\u2019s going to be fair in the Senate. I\u2019ll tell you what I would do. I would tell Mitch McConnell that he ought to automatically dismiss it. There\u2019s got to be a default. There\u2019s got to be \u2014 if you\u2019re entitled to a speedy trial, if you\u2019re entitled to be able to \u2014 if there\u2019s a statute of limitations, it\u2019s passed.\n\nThis thing, there should be a default judgment, overdone for non- prosecution. What is McConnell waiting for?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I think what McConnell is looking and seeing, and you\u2019ve (ph) talked to all the senators over there. Here, they\u2019re going back in session. We will be back in session next week. That is when Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, should name the managers and send it over.\n\nShe does not have a right to dictate what the Senate will do, just as the Senate didn\u2019t have a right to dictate to the House.\n\nIn the House, she did not allow the minority to offer any witnesses. She did not give this President any procedures that we had given to Clinton and to Nixon. She changed the whole dynamic of where to go. And she forced us through the thinnest, the weakest and the fastest impeachment in the history.\n\nShe said it had to be bipartisan. And the only bipartisan vote was against impeachment.\n\nShe knows this is weak. She is showing her hand that it is weak, and when it goes into Senate, it will fail.\n\nPIRRO: But this is crazy. Well, but why can\u2019t the Senate dismiss it out of hand right now? If Article 1 Section 2 says the House impeaches, Article 1 Section 3 says that the Senate does the actual trial. You know what? I make a motion to dismiss. I make a motion to dismiss for non-prosecution, for failure to have a speedy trial, denial of my rights, all of that don\u2019t even go along with this game. This is a charade. It\u2019s a shell game.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be upset with you. I am upset with Mitch McConnell.\n\nMCCARTHY: It shows very clearly that it\u2019s a shell game. If 51 senators \u2014\n\nPIRRO: Yes.\n\nMCCARTHY: I hear you completely. And I think America is upset.\n\nPIRRO: He is never coming on my show by the way now.\n\nMCCARTHY: And you should be upset with Mitch McConnell. You should be upset \u2014 you should be very upset with Nancy Pelosi. Listen to what Schumer is asking. Schumer is now asking for witnesses when they would not even allow the minority to have witnesses.\n\nThey want to have Bolton. The Democrats could pull whoever they wanted. They never subpoenaed Bolton. But now they know their case is so weak. This is outrageous to the whole American public.\n\nHere we are with so many other problems before us. We know this is going to fail in the Senate. If 51 senators got together based upon what Nancy Pelosi has done here, they could dismiss this. And I believe if \u2014\n\nPIRRO: Yes.\n\nMCCARTHY: \u2014 Nancy Pelosi does not move with the managers in the next week, then I think you\u2019ll see a movement within the Senate to do just that.\n\nPIRRO: Well, I hope so. It should be done. It should have been done on January 1st. But what she is doing is she is holding her finger to the wind, hoping that something will increase the chances of impeachment to get a few extra senators in the Senate so that she can win.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/mccarthy-pelosi-third-article-impeachment/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Republican Jeanne Ives: Sean Casten a 'Symbol' of the Radical Left", "text": "Former Illinois state representative and sixth congressional district Republican candidate Jeanne Ives told Breitbart News Saturday that Rep.

Our own DOD war manual discusses the protection of cultural property.\n\nSo, why is the president threatening Iran with war crimes?\n\nPOMPEO: Yes. We\u2019ll behave lawfully. We\u2019ll behave inside the system. We always have and we always will, George. You know that.\n\nThe president was getting to this point. In the past, previous administrations had allowed Shia militias to take shots at us, and in the past, we responded in theater, trying to challenge and attack everybody who was running around with AK-47 or a piece of indirect artillery.\n\nWe\u2019ve made a very different approach. We\u2019ve told the Iranian regime, enough. You can\u2019t get away with using proxy forces and think your homeland will be safe and secure.\n\nWe\u2019re going to respond against the actual decision-makers, the people who are causing this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran. We\u2019re going to take this seriously and we\u2019re going to defend the American people at every turn, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, just to be clear, when the president said he had 52 Iranian sites, including sites important to the Iranian culture, that wasn\u2019t accurate?\n\nPOMPEO: George, I\u2019ve seen what we are planning in terms of the target set. I\u2019m sure the Department of Defense is continuing to develop options. The American people should know that every target that we strike will be a lawful target, and it will be a target designed with a singular mission, of protecting and defending America.\n\nPresident Trump has been diligent about that. He doesn\u2019t want war. Talked about this repeatedly. He is a reluctant participant in this. But he will never shy away from protecting America.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/abcs-stephanopoulos-to-pompeo-why-is-the-president-threatening-iran-with-war-crimes/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "FNC\u2019s Chris Wallace Calls Soleimani Kill a \u2018Dramatic Escalation\u2019", "text": "On this weekend\u2019s broadcast of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d host Chris Wallace called the Trump administration killing Qasem Soleimani \u201ca dramatic escalation,\u201d in tensions with Iran.\n\nWallace said, \u201cDoes the decision to escalate dramatically and I think we would agree it was a dramatic escalation to take out Qasem Soleimani, does it make the U.S. more safe or less safe? And if Iran decides to keep its promise to retaliate dramatically, does the Trump administration have a strategy?\u201d\n\nFormer Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Michael Anton pushed back, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. You could interpret it as a justified retaliation for all kinds of things that Iran has been doing without much of a response. The main point I would want to make here is the Iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation. And when they finally do get pushed back, the next ten to back down and go into turtle mode for a little while, and that may yet happen again. We\u2019ve seen that happen in the past. They haven\u2019t faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the Iran deal all around the Middle East, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they I think got overconfident. To some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that Soleimani went right into Iraq and the airport completely confident that he owns the place and that nothing would happen to him. So I think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to move you make regime treat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.\u201d\n\nWallace then asked, \u201cPresident Trump very publicly and has reaffirmed that as recently as this fall with the situation in Syria, ran on getting the U.S. out of endless wars in the Middle East but as I discussed with Secretary Pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 u.s. troops into the region, so are we getting out, or are we getting deeper?\u201d\n\nFormer Chief of Staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Josh Holmes said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s inconsistent at all.

Darren Tynan.\n\n\u201cJada is (from) the second litter bred here in the United States,\u201d Tynan told Lehigh Valley Live in an email. \u201cShe was formally accepted in August 2016 as our first K9 officer. We went on to train for narcotics and patrol certifications for more than 10 months.\u201d\n\nLaver, Jada\u2019s owner, served in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 with the U.S. Army 10th Mountain Division\u2019s 57th Gun Truck Co, WRNJ reported.\n\n\u201cMy passion for K9 started during my deployment as I worked with and observed military explosive detection dogs,\u201d Laver said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I learned about the Malinois breed. I had no formal K9 training until\u2026I purchased Jada as a puppy. From that point on, I would work with K9 handlers and civilian K9 teams to learn and observe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe then attended and graduated from the Union County Sheriff\u2019s K9 Academy with the certification in narcotics and patrol, criminal apprehension, tracking, article searches, etc.,\u201d Laver continued.\n\nLou DiBella, the creator of the dog house, said it took him about 45 hours to build, paint, and decorate the customized dog house in the colors of the American flag.\n\nDiBella asked his friends on Facebook on December 16 to spread the word about his creation and his intent to donate it to a worthy cause.\n\nLavers\u2019s friend surprised him with the news that he would be receiving DiBella\u2019s custom-made dog house for Jada.\n\nWe would like to thank Lou DiBella for building this dog house and donating it to K9 Jada.

The League Against Cruel Sports, which as the name suggests is an animal rights charity, said that the former employee was sacked for gross misconduct and that his veganism had nothing to do with it.\n\nJudge Robin Postle is yet to rule on Casamitjana\u2019s dismissal, but said ethical veganism counts as a \u201creligion or belief\u201d protected under the Equality Act 2010, and that it was \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cworthy\u201d of respect in a democratic society, as defined by the criteria of the law.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief,\u201d Judge Postle said from the tribual court in Norwich, according to the BBC.\n\nUK Judge Rules Belief That \u2018Men Cannot Change Into Women\u2019 Is \u2018Not Worthy of Respect In a Democratic Society\u2019 https://t.co/GU41SeSHxo \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 19, 2019\n\nMr Casamitjana\u2019s lawyer Peter Daly said that the ruling will have a \u201cpotentially significant\u201d impact, saying that perceived hateful comments directed at ethical vegans \u201cmight be seen to be harassment in the same way a racist or sexist slur might be discriminatory action\u201d.\n\nBBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said that while the ruling has no binding legal precedent, it could open doors to other court challenges against other employers or educators, suggesting that climate change fanatics could attempt to have their philosophical beliefs protected from discrimination.\n\nJournalist Toby Young pointed out the hypocrisy of one British judge ruling that ethical veganism was a belief worthy of respect in modern Britain while another ruled that believing there are two, unchangeable genders is not.\n\nMr Young said: \u201cSo \u2018ethical veganism\u2019 is a \u2018philosophical belief\u2019 protected by the Equality Act, but believing in the biological reality of sex is not.

The League Against Cruel Sports, which as the name suggests is an animal rights charity, said that the former employee was sacked for gross misconduct and that his veganism had nothing to do with it.\n\nJudge Robin Postle is yet to rule on Casamitjana\u2019s dismissal, but said ethical veganism counts as a \u201creligion or belief\u201d protected under the Equality Act 2010, and that it was \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cworthy\u201d of respect in a democratic society, as defined by the criteria of the law.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief,\u201d Judge Postle said from the tribual court in Norwich, according to the BBC.\n\nUK Judge Rules Belief That \u2018Men Cannot Change Into Women\u2019 Is \u2018Not Worthy of Respect In a Democratic Society\u2019 https://t.co/GU41SeSHxo \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 19, 2019\n\nMr Casamitjana\u2019s lawyer Peter Daly said that the ruling will have a \u201cpotentially significant\u201d impact, saying that perceived hateful comments directed at ethical vegans \u201cmight be seen to be harassment in the same way a racist or sexist slur might be discriminatory action\u201d.\n\nBBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said that while the ruling has no binding legal precedent, it could open doors to other court challenges against other employers or educators, suggesting that climate change fanatics could attempt to have their philosophical beliefs protected from discrimination.\n\nJournalist Toby Young pointed out the hypocrisy of one British judge ruling that ethical veganism was a belief worthy of respect in modern Britain while another ruled that believing there are two, unchangeable genders is not.\n\nMr Young said: \u201cSo \u2018ethical veganism\u2019 is a \u2018philosophical belief\u2019 protected by the Equality Act, but believing in the biological reality of sex is not.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questioned if President Donald Trump\u2019s reasons for the Qasem Soleimani assassination was to distract from impeachment.\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think that the question that we ought to focus on is why now? Why not a month ago, and why not a month from now? And the answer from the administration seems to be that they can\u2019t keep their story straight on this. They pointed in all different directions. And you know, the last time that we watched them do this was the summer over Ukraine. As soon as people started asking about the conversations between Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine and why aid had been held up to Ukraine, the administration did the same thing. They pointed in all directions of what was going on. And of course, what emerged then is that this is Donald Trump just trying to advance Donald Trump\u2019s own political agenda. Not the agenda of the United States of America. So what happens right now? Next week, the president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he is deeply upset about that. I think that people are reasonably asking why this moment? Why does he pick now to take this highly inflammatory, highly dangerous action that moves us closer to war? We have been at war for 20 years in the Middle East, and we need to stop the war this the Middle East and not expand it.\u201d\n\nTapper asked, \u201cAre you suggesting that President Trump pulled the trigger and had Qasem Soleimani killed as a distraction from impeachment?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cLook, I think that people are reasonably asking about the timing and why it is that the administration seems to have all kinds of different answers. In the first 48 hours after this attack, what did we hear? Well, we heard it was for an imminent attack, and then we heard, no, no, it is to prevent any future attack, and then we heard that it is from the vice president himself and no, it is related to 9/11, and then we heard from president reports of people in the intelligence community saying that the whole, that the threat was overblown. You know, when the administration doesn\u2019t seem to have a coherent answer for taking a step like this. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, a step that puts everyone at risk, and step that puts the military at risk and puts the diplomats in the region at risk. And we have already paid a huge price for this war. Thousands of American lives lost, and a cost that we have paid domestically and around the world. At the same time, look at what it has done in the Middle East, millions of people who have been killed, who have been injured, who have been displaced. So this is not a moment when the president should be escalating tensions and moving us to war. The job of the president is to keep us safe, and that means move back from the edge.\u201d\n\nTapper pressed, \u201cDo you believe that President Trump pulled the trigger on this operation as a way to distract from impeachment? Is that what you think?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think it is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration immediately after having taken this decision offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what is going on.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it is the right question to ask. We will get more information as we go forward but look at the timing on this. Look at what Donald Trump has said afterward and his administration. They have pointed in multiple directions. There is a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago and not a month from now, not a less aggressive and less dangerous response. He had a whole range of responses that were presented to him. He didn\u2019t pick one of the other ones. He picked the most aggressive and the one that moves us closer to war. So what does everybody talk about today? Are we going to war? Are we going to have another five years, tens, ten years of war in the Middle East, and dragged in once again. Are we bringing another generation of young people into war? That is every bit of the conversation right now. Donald Trump has taken an extraordinarily reckless step, and we have seen it before, he is using foreign policy and uses whatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/warren-questions-if-soleimani-strike-linked-to-impeachment-look-at-the-timing/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Buttigieg: No One Believes Trump Thought Out the Consequences of Soleimani Strike", "text": "On Sunday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful South Bend, IN Mayor Pete Buttigieg said no one believes President Donald Trump thought through the consequences of killing Qasem Soleimani.\n\nButtigieg said, \u201cI would not hesitate to use force if it is necessary to protect American lives, and the question is was it necessary and better than the alternative.

United States military of terrorist attacks\u201d against \u201cBlack and Brown bodies,\u201d and referred to our nation\u2019s service members as plunderers of the \u201cnon white world.\u201d\n\nKaepernick made the statement on Saturday in a pair of tweets posted on Saturday, in an apparent response to the American attack that killed Iranian IRGC General Qasem Soleimani on Thursday.\n\nThere is nothing new about American terrorist attacks against Black and Brown people for the expansion of American imperialism. \u2014 Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) January 4,

We remember and honor the victims of Soleimani\u2019s many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Ocasio-Cortez urged her followers not to fall for the message of so-called \u201cwar advocates\u201d:\n\nWar advocates start off saying \u201cwe all want peace, but\u2026\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too late\u2026\u201d & frame a pro-peace agenda as na\u00efve to realpolitik.

The message to the Iranian people was clear: America is not against you, but against your oppressors. As if to help Trump, Iranian state TV reportedly stopped all programming to broadcast tributes to Soleimani. The Iranian people know: Trump cares more about them than their leaders do.\n\nPhillip Smyth, an expert at the Washington Institute on Iran-controlled Shia militias and the Middle East, recently called Soleimani\u2019s death a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to the Iranian regime.\n\n\u201cI would argue that this is probably the most major decapitation strike the United States has ever carried out. \u2026 This is a man who controlled a transnational foreign legion that was controlling governments in numerous different countries,\u201d Smyth said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible two-fer,\u201d he commented. \u201cThis is another one of those old hands.

He also recalled that US-Iraqi relations did not suffer despite the absence of foreign troops in the country in the period 2011-2014.\n\n\u201cDespite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,\u201d Abdul Mahdi told parliament in a speech.\n\nHe added that there are two options available regarding the withdrawal of US-led coalition troops. The first would see their immediate and complete withdrawal, the second would order foreign military personnel to leave gradually.\n\n\u201cAs Prime Minister and senior commander, I recommend the first option. Despite the external and internal difficulties that we may encounter, this option is fundamentally better for Iraq \u2026 It will help reorganise relations with the US and other nations, maintain cordial relations on the basis that territorial sovereignty is respected, and allows for no interference in internal affairs,\u201d Mahdi remarked.\n\nHezbollah Leader on US Troops in the Region\n\nEchoing the Prime Minister\u2019s words, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that the end of the US troop presence in the region, including military bases, navy ships and military personnel would be a fair punishment for Soleimani\u2019s killing.\n\nNasrallah specified that this measure should not include civilians in the country as the punishment should be directed at the institution that implemented the killing of Soleimani.\n\nSoleimani\u2019s Killing\n\nAbdul Mahdi also said that the United States informed Iraq about the plans to target the commander several minutes before the attack. He added that the Iraqi authorities gave no such permission.\n\nThe Prime Minister revealed that he was scheduled to meet with Soleimani the same morning the general was killed in an airstrike in Baghdad. According to Abdul Mahdi, the Iranian general was expected to deliver a response from Iran to \u2018a Saudi message\u2019.\n\nIn the early hours of Friday, Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of an Iraqi Shia militia group, were among those killed by a US drone attack near Baghdad International Airport. Soleimani and al-Muhandis were blamed by Washington for organising demonstrations at the US Embassy in Baghdad on 31 December.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said the recent strikes were a preemptive, defensive move to prevent war.

Despite this, Tesla is already putting price cuts into effect for the Model 3s that it is producing there.\n\nOn Thursday, the company cut the price of the Model 3 by a whopping 16%, from 355,800 yuan to 299,050 ($42,919), according to CNBC. The reduction is partly due to receiving Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles.

There are more goods to go around, and prices have fallen.\n\nThis raises the question, how does society become more productive? The two-step process is saving and investing in capital goods (the machines and tools that produce other goods).

His wage will rise if his industry upgrades the capital goods he uses and thereby makes him more productive.\n\nTextile workers who sew by hand get sewing machines, farm workers with scythes get combine harvesters, construction workers with shovels get bulldozers, etc. When this new capital allows workers to produce more for their employers (and society) than they could before, their value to their employers increases, and their wages increase.\n\nIn technical terms, new capital that is complementary to labor increases the productivity of, the demand for, and the price of labor.\n\nThis is the flip side of unemployment by automation. Sometimes capital is a substitute for labor, but it\u2019s often a complement. This is largely why workers in relatively capital-poor countries can earn multiples more when they move to countries rich with capital complementary to their labor, even holding their skills constant.\n\nThree: The Worker Accumulates Human Capital\n\nThe third route to higher wages comes from the worker himself and is the most obvious. If wages tend to equal productivity, workers can increase their wages by improving their skills to offer more to their employers\u2019 bottom lines, which also means contributing more to society\u2019s material provision.\n\nAlternatively, they could learn altogether new skills that are in higher demand and lower supply to secure new, higher-paying jobs.\n\nRemoving State Barriers\n\nUltimately, only sacrificing present consumption and investing in capital (physical or human) to increase productivity can move society forward against scarcity.

His wife, Cate Smith, said that this period was difficult for them. As newlyweds, she said their \"relationship hadn't really gelled yet.\"\n\nTimothy Hornick\n\nHornik was able to stay on active service for several years after his injury until another opportunity came to light \u2014to get his Masters in Social Work at the University of Kansas, while remaining on active duty.\n\nBoth Hornik and Smith credit this chapter of their lives for the positive outlook that Hornik has today.\n\nTim Hornick at the Purple Heart ceremony in 2005. Timothy Hornick\n\nSince he was completely blind in one eye \u2014 with limited vision in the other eye \u2014 Smith had to help her husband read his assignments. Through this, she says that she was lucky to get a similar education, which helped their relationship. She says that the communication classes were key \u2014 and helped them work through their issues.That's when they started working as a \u201cunit.\u201d\n\nHornik said that one of the strongest ways that they had to work together was when his first child, Abby, was born.\n\nTimothy Hornick\n\n\u201cIt was one of those steps forward that allowed me to really say, 'I need to change things.' I need to switch my life around and understand that we need to work together in order to make sure this newborn in this world has a life I would like her to live.\"\n\nFrom there, the couple realized that they just had to change the paradigm and find ways that work for them. For example, Smith had to teach Hornik how to change diapers. And they came up with a unique way for Hornik to know what was on his dinner plate. The result was a clock system, where different types of foods would always be at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 marks.\"Every family's different and we kinda found our little groove and we have a pretty good support network here\", Smith says.\n\nNow parents of two children, Abby, 9, and Elenor, 2, the couple says that parenting isn't much different than it is for others. They still go for walks in the evening, bike with the kids and play games together.\n\nTim and Abby walking on the beach together in Hawaii. Timothy Hornick\n\nTim and his service dog, Barney. Timothy Hornick\n\nStarting the new chapter in his life\n\nHornik medically retired from the military in 2011, which is when he began a new chapter of helping others like himself. He volunteers at several non-profits, including the Blind Veterans Association, and has his own small business, Blind Not Alone, where he consults with social workers and companies (like Aira) to help provide resources and guidance to others.\n\nAdapting and finding new ways to do things has been the common theme for Hornik the past 15 years.\n\nOne reason Hornik has been able to adapt to a variety of situations is because of his guide dog, Barney. He was encouraged to get a service animal after his mentor and close friend, Paul Mimms (who is also a blind veteran) recommended him to, because of how helpful his service animals have been. America's VetDogs matched Tim with Barney a few years ago and he's been able to get more independence.", "link": "https://www.today.com/series/veterans/blind-army-veteran-reinvents-himself-after-devastating-injury-t166852", "published": "2019-11-11T19:37:00+00:00"}, {"title": "Trump doubles down on threat to Iranian cultural sites, demands Iraq pay for U.S. base", "text": "Trump doubles down on threat to Iranian cultural sites, demands Iraq pay for U.S. base\n\nAsked about fears Iran might retaliate, the president told reporters: \"If it happens it happens.

Playing a depleted Eagles offense probably didn\u2019t hurt in terms of getting things rolling, but figuring out a way to keep Jadeveon Clowney, Jarran Reed and company going in Green Bay would be a welcome boost to whatever Wilson will have up his sleeve next Sunday.", "link": "https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/01/05/seahawks-advance-with-17-9-win-over-eagles/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Ricky Gervais doesn't waste any time offending at Golden Globes", "text": "Host Ricky Gervais at the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night in Beverly Hills, California.His opening monologue spared few in Hollywood.\n\nPaul Drinkwater / NBC via AP", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/awards/ricky-gervais-doesn-t-waste-any-time-offending-golden-globes-n1110836", "published": "2020-01-06T02:35:44+00:00"}, {"title": "Golden Globes red carpet 2020: See the best-dressed stars", "text": "The Golden Globes red carpet is gearing up with your favorite stars wearing the hottest fashions.

It was unclear exactly how the attack unfolded, but pictures of the aftermath indicated that al-Shabab was able to detonate explosives where U.S. military equipment such as helicopters and other aircraft would have been stationed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. military statement said reports indicated damage to six \"contractor-operated civilian aircraft.\"\n\nU.S. forces train Kenyan soldiers at a base attached to the airstrip known as Camp Simba, and they use the airstrip for aerial missions against al-Shabab in Somalia. The U.S. Africa Command had said in an earlier statement that the attack had been repelled with the cooperation of Kenyan forces. It was unclear whether there were any Kenyan casualties.\n\nKenyan Defence Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Njuguna said the bodies of five attackers were found.\n\nFor its part, al-Shabab said it had inflicted \u201csevere casualties\u201d on both American and Kenyan forces and confirmed that it had destroyed U.S. aircraft and vehicles.\n\nAD\n\nIn the U.S. statement, Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of Africom, said that the United States would, along with its African and international partners, pursue the perpetrators of the attack. He also said they remain committed to preventing al-Shabab from maintaining a haven to plan attacks.\n\nAD\n\nAl-Shabab, which is affiliated with al-Qaeda, has mounted a string of attacks in Kenya recently, including multiple ambushes on passenger buses traveling in the region close to the Somali border. Last Saturday, the group bombed a busy intersection in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 80 people. Almost a year ago, al-Shabab staged its most daring attack on Kenyan soil in half a decade when multiple gunmen stormed a luxury hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, causing a 20-hour siege in which at least 21 civilians were killed.\n\nAl-Shabab controls most of rural southern and central Somalia and regularly attacks Mogadishu. The group seeks to impose a strict version of Islamic law and to expel foreign troops from the country. In addition to about 500 U.S. personnel in Somalia, the African Union sponsors a coalition of about 20,000 troops, mostly from Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda.\n\nAD\n\nThe group gets most of its funding from an extensive protection racket that functions like a parallel taxation system throughout the country. It is paid tens of millions of dollars a year by farmers, business owners and others who are threatened with death if they don\u2019t pay.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. military has led a largely aerial campaign against al-Shabab for much of the past decade. In 2017, President Trump loosened the U.S. military\u2019s rules of engagement in Somalia, allowing for greater offensive use of force. Since then, the U.S. military has increased drone strikes and carried out a record 63 strikes in 2019, in which it claims to have killed hundreds of al-Shabab fighters.\n\nRael Ombuor in Nairobi contributed to this report."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/masked-assailants-attack-students-at-prestigious-indian-university/2020/01/06/81061e56-304c-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html", "published": "2020-01-06T07:50:00", "title": "Masked assailants attack students at prestigious Indian university in New Delhi", "text": "The incident comes at a moment of high political tension in India, where hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 including many students \u2014 have participated in protests against a controversial citizenship law passed last month. The law creates an expedited path to citizenship for non-Muslim migrants from three countries, a move that critics say is discriminatory and unconstitutional.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe violence at the university was not directly connected to the citizenship law but was rooted in a separate dispute roiling the campus over fees that also pitted student supporters of the government against its opponents.\n\nThe accounts of masked men roaming a well-known campus as students cowered in their dormitories and police officers posted at the main gate failed to intervene are inflaming concerns about how the Indian authorities treat those they consider adversaries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday night, several eyewitnesses said police officers stood by as a mob armed with sticks, iron rods and cricket bats entered the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, an influential bastion of left-leaning politics.\n\nThe mob yelled \u201cLong live Mother India!\u201d and attacked a meeting led by professors near a main crossroad on campus, hurling rocks at participants, witnesses said. The assailants then smashed through the glass gate at one dormitory, shouting \u201cWe will spare no one today!\u201d\n\nInside the dorm, Surya Prakash, a visually impaired doctoral candidate in Sanskrit, was sitting at his desk studying. Masked men broke into his ground-floor room and began to beat him with iron rods on his back and arms, he said. \u201cI pleaded with them that I am blind,\u201d recalled Prakash. \u201cOne hit me even harder. There is terror in our hearts.\u201d\n\nStudents said that the masked attackers included members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The ABVP denied the allegation and blamed the violence on \u201ccommunist goons.\u201d\n\nA senior Delhi police official, Devender Arya, told the television station NDTV that the police had responded promptly to calls for help from the university administration and that authorities had begun working to identify the perpetrators of the attack. Arya did not immediately respond to queries about eyewitness accounts of police inaction and allegations that police had also beaten students.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe incident sparked widespread criticism across India\u2019s political spectrum. India\u2019s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar \u2014 an alumnus of the university \u2014 wrote on Twitter that he condemned the violence \u201cunequivocally\u201d and said it \u201cwas completely against the culture and tradition of the university.\u201d\n\nMembers of the opposition Congress Party said the brazenness of the attack and the lack of an immediate police response indicated it had some kind of official sanction. \u201cIt is an act of impunity and can only happen with the support of the government,\u201d wrote P. Chidambaram, a senior Congress leader.\n\nAn official at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, a nearby hospital, said that 35 people were admitted with injuries from the incident and all were discharged by Monday.\n\nAD\n\nKumari Neelu, who is married to a professor at the university, said she had just stepped outside her home on campus when she saw the approaching mob. As she tried to film them, the men began to run toward her. She fled inside and locked the main door. The mob banged on her door with sticks and rang the bell nonstop. Her husband, Bikramaditya Choudhary, began calling the administration, security officers and the police. \u201cNobody responded,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the media hadn\u2019t arrived, we may have been butchered.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEyewitnesses also alleged that the police not only failed to stop the violence but also beat up students. Vipul Vivek, a masters student in philosophy, watched from behind shrubbery as the violence unfolded. After the mob left, he said, about 30 policemen arrived and beat the students holed up inside the dormitory earlier attacked by the mob. He ran toward a forested area and hid for 45 minutes. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight back against the police,\u201d he said.\n\nTania Dutta contributed reporting.\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/ghosns-mounting-despair-at-japanese-justice-may-have-convinced-him-to-flee/2020/01/05/7dfe92fe-2fa9-11ea-9313-6cba89b1b9fb_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T12:44:00", "title": "Ghosn\u2019s mounting despair at Japanese justice may have persuaded him to flee", "text": "The lawyer\u2019s impassioned defense of Ghosn and scathing attack on Japan\u2019s legal system has divided opinion here, even as the country\u2019s justice minister broke a week of silence to defend the treatment of the flamboyant business executive.\n\nAD\n\nJustice Minister Masako Mori called Ghosn\u2019s departure \u201cpresumably illegal,\u201d unjustifiable and \u201cextremely regrettable,\u201d adding there was no record of him leaving the country.\n\nAD\n\nIn her first statement after a week-long New Year\u2019s holiday here, she promised a thorough investigation and directed the Immigration Services Agency to tighten immigration procedures at departure.\n\nGhosn has said he was fleeing political persecution and a rigged justice system.\n\nTakano described how Ghosn would ask his lawyers the same question again and again as the months went by: Could he expect a fair trial in Japan? Their answer was always no \u2014 no criminal defendant in Japan can expect a fair trial. Still, they argued, the evidence against him was weak, and there was still a good chance they would establish his innocence.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors enjoy considerable powers in Japan, and once they decide to accept a case, conviction rates are around 99 percent. But more than any other lawyers in this country, Ghosn\u2019s defense team had a track record of getting people off the hook.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPlease trust us,\u201d Takano would tell Ghosn.\n\n\u201cApparently, his doubts and concerns began to grow,\u201d Takano said, alleging prosecutors were slow to respond to requests for the disclosure of evidence, imposed minute restrictions on how evidence would be disclosed and even eliminated some of the evidence, all the while leaking \u201cas much as they liked\u201d to the Japanese media.\n\nIn his regular meetings with his lawyers, Ghosn\u2019s frustration showed in his face as he asked questions, Takano said. But over time the questions became fewer, as anger gave way to despair.\n\nGhosn was accused of four charges of financial misconduct while running Nissan, including underreporting his income and using company money for his own benefit. But he says he was the victim of a conspiracy among prosecutors, officials and Nissan to block his plans to deepen the company\u2019s merger with its French partner, Renault.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven Renault, initially supportive, said its internal investigations had found evidence of unethical practices. Nevertheless, Japanese business executives accused of far more serious crimes have been let off or given little more than a slap on the wrist, and many foreign executives here see Ghosn\u2019s treatment as an example of double standards.\n\nBut stresses on his family life may also have played a role in his decision to flee.\n\nUnder the terms of his bail, Ghosn was forbidden by the court from meeting his wife Carole, or even speaking to her for seven months, on the grounds they might conspire to tamper with evidence.\n\n\u201cThis is a criminal punishment,\u201d Ghosn complained to his lawyers. \u201cWhen am I ever going to be able to lead a normal family life?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Ghosn was allowed a one-hour video call with Carole, in a lawyer\u2019s office, the first in a month. They talked about their children, relatives and friends, their lives and their memories, Takano said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was no shortage of things to talk about,\u201d Takano said. \u201cJust when the time had come for them to stop after an hour, he spoke to the display: \u2018My relationship with you cannot be replaced by children and friends. You are my indispensable presence. I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said he was deeply moved.\n\n\u201cI have never felt such strong despair over Japan\u2019s legal system as I did at that time. I felt something nearly close to a sense of wanting to kill. I said to him \u2018Carlos, I am very sorry. Truly, the Japanese system is shameful. I will do our utmost to improve this situation as soon as possible,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nGhosn didn\u2019t respond.\n\nOn Dec. 25, just a day after his video call, Ghosn learned that his trial, initially expected to begin in April, could be delayed further, possibly into 2021, lawyers and friends say. That news played a part in his decision to flee, his friend Ricardo Karam said, a suggestion supported by another of Ghosn\u2019s defense lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wonder if he was strongly shocked in those two days,\u201d he told the Asahi newspaper.\n\nFour days later, at noon on Dec. 29, Ghosn strolled out of his home, alone, never to return, Japan\u2019s NHK reported.\n\nAlthough surveillance cameras had been installed outside the property, the system was only designed to prevent him from holding unauthorized meetings and not to keep him under house arrest, and footage was only handed over to the court once a month, Takano says.\n\nAD\n\nConcerned that Ghosn could tamper with evidence, Nissan had hired a private security firm to track him when he left his home, Reuters and Japan\u2019s Sankei newspaper reported.\n\nBut on Dec. 27, Ghosn\u2019s lawyers filed a criminal complaint to Tokyo police about the surveillance, and it was withdrawn, Hironaka told the Asahi newspaper.\n\nGhosn bypassed immigration at Osaka\u2019s Kansai airport by hiding in a large black case typically used to carry audio gear, according to the Wall Street Journal, while his name was not included on the plane\u2019s passenger manifest.\n\nOn Sunday, the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office said Ghosn\u2019s escape constituted a crime. It also defended the country\u2019s legal system, arguing that although conviction rates are high, defendants are given a proper chance to present their case and courts reach judgments strictly on the basis of the evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGhosn was initially detained for more than 100 days, released on bail and then rearrested in April shortly after he announced plans to speak to the press. He was finally released on bail again for a further amount of nearly $5 million, after convincing the court he was not a flight risk.\n\nTakano said he learned of Ghosn\u2019s escape only through news reports.\n\n\u201cInitially, I felt a strong anger, a sense of having been betrayed. Yet, looking back how he has been treated by this country\u2019s legal system, my anger went in a different direction,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed I was betrayed. But it is not Carlos Ghosn who betrayed me.\u201d\n\nBut Takahiro Saito, deputy chief of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, defended the decision to detain Ghosn for so long, and oppose bail, arguing he had \u201csignificant influence\u201d inside Japan and around the world, and there had been a realistic danger he would destroy evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe defendant Ghosn had abundant financial power and multiple foreign bases. It was easy for him to flee,\u201d Saito said in a statement."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/getting-us-troops-out-of-iraq-might-not-be-that-hard-say-experts/2020/01/06/9f64060c-3069-11ea-898f-eb846b7e9feb_story.html", "published": "2020-01-06T10:29:23", "title": "Getting U.S. troops out of Iraq might not be that hard, say experts", "text": "Instead, the current military presence is based on an arrangement dating from 2014 that\u2019s less formal, and ultimately, based on the consent of an executive which yesterday told the troops to get out.\n\nSo, with the stroke of a pen, the 5,000-strong force could technically be asked to leave.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe current U.S. military presence is based of an exchange of letters at the executive level,\u201d said Ramzy Mardini, an Iraq scholar at the US Institute of Peace who previously served in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.\n\nAD\n\nThe terms outlined in those letters have not been made public.\n\n\u201cWe have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that\u2019s there.

U.S. commanders say that the mission remains crucial to preventing the group\u2019s resurgence. The coalition said Sunday that it had been forced to suspend training activities and was focusing instead on simply keeping its personnel safe.\n\nAD\n\nAddressing Iraq\u2019s wood-paneled parliament on Sunday, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi urged lawmakers to take \u201curgent measures\u201d to force the withdrawal of foreign troops. Shortly after, the chamber passed a nonbinding resolution to that effect, and Abdul Mahdi\u2019s office said that legal experts were drawing up a timetable for the pullout.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt this moment in time [the] government has not yet decided to remove foreign troops but it is probable soon as things stand,\u201d Sajad Jiyad, managing director of the Baghdad-based Bayan Center think tank, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt is plausible that such action from the Iraqi side will build in a lengthy period but not beyond 2020. The other side may decide to withdraw rather than be pushed out,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nWhile parliamentary approval seems not to be needed, at least technically speaking, their vote Sunday provides political cover for a prime minister who has been operating in a caretaker capacity since mass protests forced his resignation back in November.\n\n\u201cThere is no law required to kick the U.S. military out because a law did not establish their presence,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cBaghdad has demonstrated its signal to Washington that the presence of the U.S. military is no longer wanted in Iraq.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, led prayers in perfect Arabic, choking on his words as he stood by coffins covered in the Iranian flag \u2014 save one in the black, red, white and green of the Iraqi flag, where Muhandis likely lay.\n\nAD\n\nYemen\u2019s city of Saada, held by the Iran-allied Houthis, also exploded with millions of mourners filling the streets and protesting the strike that killed the Iranian and Iraqi symbols.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nTrump meanwhile threatened Saturday on Twitter to strike \u201c52 Iranian sites . . . some at a very high level & important to Iran and the Iranian culture\u201d should Tehran retaliate against Americans or U.S. interests in the region. Iran has 24 locations on the U.N. list of cultural world heritage sites.\n\n\n\nIf Trump were to carry out his threats, Dehghan said, \u201cno American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe.\u201d\n\nTrump later tweeted: \u201cThese Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSuch legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Iraqi military said late Sunday that six rockets had landed in Baghdad, including three inside the Green Zone, a fortified neighborhood housing many foreigners and the U.S. Embassy.\n\nA U.S. diplomat said rockets apparently hit a vehicle lot in the embassy compound.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement, echoed Dehghan\u2019s statement, declaring Sunday that as retribution for Soleimani\u2019s death, U.S. troops in the Middle East, and not U.S. civilians, should be targeted.\n\n\u201cIt is the U.S. military that killed Haj Qasem, and they must pay the price,\u201d Nasrallah said, referring to Soleimani. \u201cTouching any civilian anywhere in the world will only serve Trump\u2019s policy.\u201d\n\nU.S. allies widely share concerns about the consequences of Soleimani\u2019s death. NATO will convene an emergency meeting of its ambassadors Monday to discuss the situation in Iraq. NATO suspended its training programs in the country, and several member nations have scrambled to protect their troops and citizens there.\n\nAD\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Embassy released a security alert Sunday advising Americans of \u201cthe heightened risk of missile and drone attacks\u201d against both civilian and military targets.\n\nThe United States blamed Iran for a drone and cruise missile attack on Saudi state oil facilities in September, a strike that knocked half of the nation\u2019s oil production offline.\n\nWhile Saudi officials have long urged the United States to take stronger action against what they say is Iran\u2019s unchecked expansionism in the region, they have also expressed discomfort at the rising tensions between Washington and Tehran.\n\nAbdul Mahdi suggested Sunday that Iran and the Saudis had been engaged in dialogue to tamp down their feud, with Iraq playing the role of mediator. Abdul Mahdi said he had been expecting to meet with Soleimani on the day he was killed. \u201cHe came to deliver me a message from Iran, responding to the message we delivered from Saudi Arabia to Iran,\u201d the prime minister said, without providing details.\n\nAD\n\nO n Sunday, Soleimani\u2019s body was flown in a flag-draped coffin to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, following a funeral procession in Baghdad and Iraq\u2019s twin Shiite shrine cities, Karbala and Najaf. It was later carried to the northeastern city of Mashhad, home to the shrine of Imam Reza, a revered figure in Shiite Islam. Iran is ruled by a Shiite theocracy.\n\nFootage broadcast on Iranian state television showed tens of thousands of black-clad mourners waving flags and chanting religious slogans. Iran\u2019s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency described the scene as \u201cglorious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll schools and businesses are closed today \u2014 he was popular here and even more popular now,\u201d said Farnaz, 33, a computer engineer and resident of Ahvaz, referring to Soleimani.

Iranian authorities said that they would no longer abide by restrictions on uranium enrichment, but would return to their previous commitments should the United States withdraw the sanctions whose imposition were also a violation of the pact. The announcement had been expected before Soleimani\u2019s assassination but took on a darker cast as tensions mounted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Iraq, too, the backlash was swift. The country\u2019s parliament voted on Sunday to ask for the removal of U.S. troops on Iraqi soil. The resolution was nonbinding and \u201cdid not immediately imperil the U.S. presence in Iraq,\u201d wrote The Post\u2019s Erin Cunningham, \u201cbut it highlights the head winds the Trump administration faces after the strike, which was seen in Iraq as a violation of sovereignty and as a dangerous escalation by governments across the Middle East.\u201d\n\nFor President Trump and some of the Washington foreign policy establishment, though, it still may be worth it. In Trump\u2019s words, Soleimani was \u201cthe number one terrorist in the world,\u201d the mastermind behind a generation of asymmetric warfare in the region, as well as various plots against America. In briefings with reporters, U.S. officials justified the targeted killing of Soleimani as an act of \u201cdeterrence\u201d based on intelligence that the senior leader was planning a number of \u201cimminent\u201d possible attacks on U.S. interests. But other officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to my colleagues and other outlets, suggested that the evidence of Soleimani\u2019s direct involvement was \u201crazor thin\u201d and that Trump had chosen the most extreme path of retaliation after pro-Iran militiamen ransacked sections of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq last week.\n\nSoleimani was the head of the Quds Force, a wing of Iran\u2019s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that steers the regime\u2019s proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. These factions have been locked in months of shadow conflict with the United States and its allies in the wake of Trump\u2019s reimposition of sweeping sanctions on Iran after quitting the Obama-era nuclear deal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn one hand, the Trump administration believes its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran is working and that killing Soleimani adds to the regime\u2019s internal strains. But Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region \u2014 a key reason cited by Trump for reneging on the nonproliferation pact \u2014 have only spiked in recent months, including alleged attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq, shipping in the Persian Gulf and a major Saudi oil facility.\n\n....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.

But the path ahead remains deeply treacherous. \u201cMy sense is that we will see an escalation in Iraq,\u201d said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, to my colleague Liz Sly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Iranians really want a war with the U.S. I don\u2019t think they are interested in an all-out regional conflict. The problem is that all it takes is one small error and the whole region would be engulfed.\"\n\nAmid the crisis, the United States ordered American citizens to leave Iraq and suspended its military cooperation and training programs with Iraqi security forces. The latter action risks undermining the ongoing effort to defeat the extremist Islamic State. And the Trump administration has hardly rallied a united front to its cause, with Pompeo bemoaning how European allies \u2014 who are trying to keep afloat the gutted husk of the nuclear deal \u2014 were \u201cnot helpful\u201d enough.\n\n\u201cFor European capitals,\u201d wrote Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cthis means their worst predictions \u2014 they warned the Trump administration that withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal would trigger a chain of escalation with Iran \u2014 are becoming reality.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/killing-of-soleimani-follows-long-push-from-pompeo-for-aggressive-action-against-iran-but-airstrike-brings-serious-risks/2020/01/05/092a8e00-2f7d-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T12:00:00", "title": "Killing of Soleimani follows long push from Pompeo for aggressive action against Iran, but airstrike brings serious risks", "text": "The secretary also spoke to President Trump multiple times every day last week, culminating in Trump\u2019s decision to approve the killing of Iran\u2019s top military commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, at the urging of Pompeo and Vice President Pence, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo had lost a similar high-stakes deliberation last summer when Trump declined to retaliate militarily against Iran after it downed a U.S. surveillance drone, an outcome that left Pompeo \u201cmorose,\u201d according to one U.S. official. But recent changes to Trump\u2019s national security team and the whims of a president anxious about being viewed as hesitant in the face of Iranian aggression created an opening for Pompeo to press for the kind of action he had been advocating.\n\nThe greenlighting of the airstrike near Baghdad airport represents a bureaucratic victory for Pompeo, but it also carries multiple serious risks: another protracted regional war in the Middle East; retaliatory assassinations of U.S. personnel stationed around the world; an interruption in the battle against the Islamic State; the closure of diplomatic pathways to containing Iran\u2019s nuclear program; and a major backlash in Iraq, whose parliament voted on Sunday to expel all U.S. troops from the country.\n\nFor Pompeo, whose political ambitions are a source of constant speculation, the death of U.S. diplomats would be particularly damaging given his unyielding criticisms of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton following the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and other American personnel in Benghazi in 2012.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut none of those considerations stopped Pompeo from pushing for the targeted strike, U.S. officials said, underscoring a fixation on Iran that spans 10 years of government service from Congress to the CIA to the State Department.\n\n\u201cWe took a bad guy off the battlefield. We made the right decision,\u201d Pompeo told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the effort that President Trump undertook.\u201d\n\nPompeo first spoke with Trump about killing Soleimani months ago, said a senior U.S. official, but neither the president nor Pentagon officials were willing to countenance such an operation.\n\nFor more than a year, defense officials warned that the administration\u2019s campaign of economic sanctions against Iran had increased tensions with Tehran, requiring a bigger and bigger share of military resources in the Middle East when many at the Pentagon wanted to redeploy their firepower to East Asia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, too, sought to draw down from the Middle East as he promised from the opening days of his presidential campaign. But that mind-set shifted on Dec. 27 when 30 rockets hit a joint U.S.-Iraqi base outside Kirkuk, killing an American civilian contractor and injuring service members.\n\nOn Dec. 29, Pompeo, Esper and Milley traveled to the president\u2019s private club in Florida, where the two defense officials presented possible responses to Iranian aggression, including the option of killing Soleimani, senior U.S. officials said.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to target Soleimani came as a surprise and a shock to some officials briefed on his decision, given the Pentagon\u2019s long-standing concerns about escalation and the president\u2019s aversion to using military force against Iran.\n\nAD\n\nOne significant factor was the \u201clockstep\u201d coordination for the operation between Pompeo and Esper, both graduates in the same class at the U.S. Military Academy, who deliberated ahead of the briefing with Trump, senior U.S. officials said. Pence also endorsed the decision, but he did not attend the meeting in Florida.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTaking out Soleimani would not have happened under [former secretary of defense Jim] Mattis,\u201d said a senior administration official who argued that the Mattis Pentagon was risk-averse. \u201cMattis was opposed to all of this. It\u2019s not a hit on Mattis, it\u2019s just his predisposition. Milley and Esper are different. Now you\u2019ve got a cohesive national security team and you\u2019ve got a secretary of state and defense secretary who\u2019ve known each other their whole adult lives.\u201d\n\nMattis declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nIn the days since the strike, Pompeo has become the voice of the administration on the matter, speaking to allies and making the public case for the operation. Trump chose Pompeo to appear on all of the Sunday news shows because he \u201csticks to the line\u201d and \u201cnever gives an inch,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nAD\n\nBut critics inside and outside the administration have questioned Pompeo\u2019s justification for the strike based on his claims that \u201cdozens if not hundreds\u201d of American lives were at risk.\n\nLawmakers left classified briefings with U.S. intelligence officials on Friday saying they heard nothing to suggest that the threat posed by the proxy forces guided by Soleimani had changed substantially in recent months.\n\nAD\n\nWhen repeatedly pressed on Sunday about the imminent nature of the threats, whether it was days or weeks away, or whether they had been foiled by the U.S. airstrike, Pompeo dismissed the questions.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an American in the region, days and weeks \u2014 this is not something that\u2019s relevant,\u201d Pompeo told CNN.\n\nSome defense officials said Pompeo\u2019s claims of an imminent and direct threat were overstated, and they would prefer that he make the case based on the killing of the American contractor and previous Iranian provocations.\n\nAD\n\nCritics have also questioned how an imminent attack would be foiled by killing Soleimani, who would not have carried out the strike himself.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the attack was going to take place when Soleimani was alive, it is difficult to comprehend why it wouldn\u2019t take place now that he is dead,\u201d said Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former Obama administration official.\n\nFollowing the strike, Pompeo has held back-to-back phone calls with his counterparts around the globe but has received a chilly reception from European allies, many of whom fear that the attack puts their embassies in Iran and Iraq in jeopardy and has now eliminated the chance to keep a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cWe have woken up to a more dangerous world,\u201d said France\u2019s Europe minister, Amelie de Montchalin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo European diplomats familiar with the calls said Pompeo expected European leaders to champion the U.S. strike publicly even though they were never consulted on the decision.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has not helped the Iran situation, and now they want everyone to cheerlead this,\u201d one diplomat said.\n\n\u201cOur position over the past few years has been about defending the JCPOA,\u201d said the diplomat, referring to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\nOn Sunday, Iran announced that it was suspending all limits of the nuclear deal, including on uranium enrichment, research and development, and enlarging its stockpile of nuclear fuel. Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China, were original signatories of that deal with the United States and Iran, and all opposed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the pact.\n\n\u201cNo one trusts what Trump will do next, so it\u2019s hard to get behind this,\u201d said the European diplomat.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo has slapped back at U.S. allies, saying \u201cthe Brits, the French, the Germans all need to understand that what we did \u2014 what the Americans did \u2014 saved lives in Europe as well,\u201d he told Fox News.\n\nIsrael has stood out in emphatically cheering the Soleimani operation, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praising Trump for \u201cacting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense,\u201d he said.\n\nSince his time as CIA director, Pompeo has forged a friendship with Yossi Cohen, the director of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, said a person familiar with their meetings. The men have spoken about the threat posed by Iran to both Israel and the United States. In a prescient interview in October, Cohen said Soleimani \u201cknows perfectly well that his elimination is not impossible.\u201d\n\nThough Democrats have greeted the strike with skepticism, Republican leaders, who have long viewed Pompeo as a reassuring voice in the administration, uniformly praised the decision as the eradication of a terrorist who directed the killing of U.S. soldiers in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\n\u201cSoleimani made it his life\u2019s work to take the Iranian revolutionary call for death to America and death to Israel and turn them into action,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said.\n\nA critical moment for Pompeo is nearing as he faces growing questions about a potential Senate run, though some GOP insiders say that decision seems to have stalled. Pompeo has kept in touch with Ward Baker, a political consultant who would probably lead the operation, and others in McConnell\u2019s orbit, about a bid. But Pompeo hasn\u2019t committed one way or the other, people familiar with the conversations said.\n\nSome people close to the secretary say he has mixed feelings about becoming a relatively junior senator from Kansas after leading the State Department and CIA, but there is little doubt in Pompeo\u2019s home state that he could win.\n\nAt every step of his government career, Pompeo has tried to stake out a maximalist position on Iran that has made him popular among two critical pro-Israel constituencies in Republican politics: conservative Jewish donors and Christian evangelicals.\n\nAfter Trump tapped Pompeo to lead the CIA, Pompeo quickly set up an Iran Mission Center at the agency to focus intelligence-gathering efforts and operations, elevating Iran\u2019s importance as an intelligence target.\n\nAt the State Department, he is a voracious consumer of diplomatic notes and reporting on Iran, and he places the country far above other geopolitical and economic hot spots in the world."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/hezbollah-says-retribution-for-soleimanis-death-must-target-us-military-not-civilians/2020/01/05/50869828-2e62-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T07:09:00", "title": "Hezbollah says retribution for Soleimani\u2019s death must target U.S. military, not civilians", "text": "The killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani: What you need to read\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know to understand what this moment means in U.S.-Iran relations.\n\nWhat happened: President Trump ordered a drone strike near the Baghdad airport, killing Maj.

The militia supporters were protesting the killing of 25 fighters in U.S. airstrikes. The strikes were carried out in response to the death of a U.S. contractor in a rocket attack against a military base in Kirkuk that the United States blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWhat happens next: Soleimani\u2019s killing could be a catalyst for greater violence, experts warned.

It\u2019s worth noting \u2014 especially because, in a legal context, it may not mean exactly what the average person thinks it does.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAn imminent threat is what you would need to justify taking an action in self-defense,\u201d said Oona Hathaway, a professor of international law at Yale University and a former national security lawyer in the Defense Department\u2019s Office of General Counsel.\n\nAD\n\nThe word has been repeatedly used by Trump and other members of his administration to describe alleged plots against U.S. personnel in the Middle East that they say Soleimani was facilitating and that the strike on him may have prevented.\n\nTrump has spoken of \u201cimminent and sinister attacks,\u201d but the administration has provided little detail about the alleged plots or why the threat was deemed imminent. \u201cWe know it was imminent,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during an interview with CNN on Friday, without offering any specifics.\n\nAD\n\nHathaway noted that the word was not used in the initial Pentagon statement announcing the strike against Soleimani. \u201cIt makes me wonder whether the lawyers realized that they had a problem on their hands,\u201d she said.\n\nAs leader of the elite Quds Force, a branch of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Soleimani had certainly played a role in significant plots against U.S. personnel in the past. There is little reason to believe that he was not involved in similar plots shortly before his death.\n\nAD\n\nIt is unclear, however, what specific evidence tied him to a new plot or how this evidence showed that neutralizing him would have foiled such a plot.\n\nAD\n\nBut the administration\u2019s frequent use of \u201cimminent\u201d is probably not a coincidence. Both domestic and international law, in theory, place limits on a U.S. president\u2019s ability to unilaterally engage in a military conflict with a foreign power: The 1973 War Powers Resolution, for example, states that a U.S. president requires congressional authorization to go to war.\n\nSome analysts said the Trump administration appears unsure how to legally present its case for the killing of Soleimani.\n\nNational security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has told reporters that the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution allowed the killing of Soleimani, an argument that is almost certain to be disputed by lawyers and members of Congress because of the starkly different context of the Friday strike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut by repeatedly describing an Iranian plot against U.S. personnel as \u201cimminent,\u201d the administration is making a potentially more persuasive argument: Its move against Soleimani was an act of self-defense, not aggression.\n\nIn both domestic and international law, that is an important distinction, and the idea of an imminent threat adds weight to it. \u201cImminence is relevant legally mainly as a way of constructing an argument of anticipatory self-defense,\u201d said David Bosco, a professor at Indiana University\u2019s Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution names the president as the commander in chief of the United States; it is generally accepted that this grants him or her the unilateral power to \u201crepel sudden attack.\u201d The Charter of the United Nations says there is an \u201cinherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe right to self-defense is widely understood to extend beyond attacks that have already occurred. \u201cIt is well-established that countries can respond preemptively if there is an imminent attack that gives little other option,\u201d Bosco said.\n\nHowever, it may not mean that the United States had evidence of a specific upcoming plot. The U.S. government generally takes a broad view of what imminent may mean. Though the Trump administration has been accused of taking a lax view of legal requirements, this broad definition predates it.\n\nIn an April 2016 speech that sought to explain the legal justification for the U.S. involvement in war against the Islamic State militant group, State Department legal adviser Brian Egan argued that there didn\u2019t even need to be specific information about a threat for it to be considered imminent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe absence of specific evidence of where an attack will take place or of the precise nature of an attack does not preclude a conclusion that an armed attack is imminent for purposes of the exercise of the right of self-defense,\u201d Egan said.\n\nA November 2012 speech by Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general in the Obama administration, justified the killing of members of al-Qaeda by suggesting that the group\u2019s past violence showed it could pose a continued threat.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not require the president to delay action until some theoretical end stage of planning \u2014 when the precise time, place and manner of an attack become clear,\u201d Holder said.\n\nAD\n\nIn this instance, Soleimani\u2019s history of helping facilitate attacks on U.S. troops may have been enough to legally justify his killing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question from a legal perspective of what he may have been planning next,\u201d said Bobby Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, first and foremost, of what he has done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nControversially, this broad definition is arguably not what most people would think of when they hear the words \u201cimminent attack.\u201d However, domestic national security law is often defined by executive branch lawyers and only rarely challenged in courts, and international law has limited recourse for a powerful nation like the United States.\n\n\u201cPeople want the law to do a lot of work here that perhaps strategy and policy need to do,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a lawyer with the National Security Council during the Obama administration who is now a law professor at Georgetown. He said he doubted the strike could face serious legal challenge.\n\nAD\n\nHathaway argued, however, that Trump\u2019s strike was probably unconstitutional. That the administration did not notify the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bipartisan U.S. senators, as well as Trump\u2019s continued threats to Iran in the wake of the military operation, would diminish the argument that the strike on Soleimani was carried out in self-defense.\n\nBut she also said it was unlikely that courts would step in. \u201cCongress really is the only bulwark against the president who wants to unilaterally use force,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it was lawful if it was a terrible idea,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake to equate legality with wisdom.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/climate-change-is-playing-havoc-with-mexicos-monarch-butterfly-migration/2019/12/23/e60c1e0e-21ab-11ea-b034-de7dc2b5199b_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T11:00:00", "title": "Climate change is playing havoc with Mexico\u2019s monarch butterfly migration", "text": "No one knows when millions of monarch butterflies began crisscrossing North America, spending their winters clustered on the same hillsides in Central Mexico, a blaze of orange wings in the green forest.\n\nBut over the centuries, they were mythologized by generations of humans. Locals believed they carried the souls of their ancestors. Scientists saw the migration as the proof of insect evolution \u2014 a brittle organism that could fly 6,000 miles a year to avoid severe weather.\n\nThe butterflies are among the world\u2019s experts in climate adaptation. They spend their summers in the northern United States and Canada; they breed in the southern United States during the fall and spring; and most spend their winters here in Central Mexico, in a few giant clusters.\n\nTheir life cycles are driven by a search for optimal conditions: temperatures ideally between 55 and the low 70s when they migrate, some rain during their winters and plenty of milkweed when they mate. The criteria are narrow \u2014 and dependent on relatively consistent weather patterns.\n\nThat consistency no longer exists.\n\nNow summer temperatures in the Midwest are soaring. The milkweed in Texas is drying up. Winter storms, once rare, are snaking through central Mexico regularly as air warms over the Pacific Ocean and blows across the region.\n\n\u201cThe question we\u2019re asking is \u2018Can one of the world\u2019s most adaptive insects adapt to climate change?\u2019\u201d asked Karen Oberhauser, who studies the species at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cWe are changing the conditions and just waiting to see.\u201d\n\n[The smelly seaweed that turned Mexico\u2019s beaches into a rancid mess]\n\nBetween 1990 and 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says, a billion butterflies vanished.\n\nBecause over 95 percent of the population migrates en masse to a few patches of Mexican forest, each smaller than half a football field, a single storm or heat stroke could effectively kill off the population. (A smaller percentage of the butterflies winter in Southern California or Florida, where they face their own challenges.)\n\nThat nearly happened in 2002, when a winter storm killed about 75 percent of monarchs. And again in 2012, when a heat wave in the Midwest killed tens of thousands.\n\n\u201cAt every stage in their migration, they are threatened by climate change,\u201d said Eduardo Rend\u00f3n, the monarch butterfly coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund in Mexico.\n\n\n\nEach time, they rebounded \u2014 but barely. Last year, the population grew when a cold front in North Texas forced butterflies to stay in South Texas for longer than usual, increasing the length of their breeding season.\n\nBut this year brought another scare, as temperatures in Oklahoma and Kansas soared as monarchs passed through. It was the second hottest September in 125 years in those states. The impact on the population has not yet been calculated.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking 20, 30, 40 years out, we\u2019re not going to be talking about monarchs any more,\u201d said Chip Taylor, the founder of Monarch Watch and a professor at the University of Kansas.\n\n[Alberta, Canada: Rat-free for 70 years!]\n\n\n\nEvery year, millions of monarch butterflies migrate to the same remote stretch of forest in central Mexico, an event scientists have long considered a great wonder of the insect world. Now the migration \u2014 and the species itself \u2014 is under threat from climate change. (Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\nOne way to chronicle the toll of climate change is simply to list, one by one, the species that it eliminates. By one measure, that list started this year.\n\nIn February, the government of Australia recognized the first mammal to go extinct due to climate change: the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lived on an island in the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nBut the melomys, with its glassy eyes and tiny rat-like mouth, was \u2014 to the human imagination, at least \u2014 as far from the majestic monarch as a species can get. Sympathy for animals is not democratic. There\u2019s nothing logical about our love for the monarch, nothing that makes its possible extinction any more tragic than that of the melomys.\n\nBut!\n\nTo see the monarch migration arrive in central Mexico is to be transported into a waking dream. Tree branches droop under the weight of thousands of butterflies. Each morning, when the sun hits, they scatter in a glittering cloud of orange wings. In parts of the forest, looking up from the ground, visitors see more butterflies than sky, the only sound the quiet flapping of wings against the ground and leaves.\n\n\u201cThe monarch's overwintering colonies in Mexico rank as one of the great biological wonders of the world,\u201d wrote Lincoln Brower, the world\u2019s preeminent expert on the species, who died last year.\n\n[Two percent of the world\u2019s North Atlantic right whales have died in the last two months]\n\n\n\nTwo girls visiting the butterfly reserve in Rosario wear monarch wings.

The monarch is among them. American scientists spent more than a century trying to find the population in Mexico. A National Geographic headline celebrated their discovery by the Canadian zoologist Fred Urquhart in August 1976: \u201cDiscovered: The Monarch\u2019s Mexican Haven.\u201d\n\nYet the people of Rosario had seen the butterflies land here for centuries. It was their own private spectacle, remote enough that no Americans had located it. Pre-Hispanic pottery has been found emblazoned with images of butterflies. Across the region, soccer teams, schools and businesses are named after the monarchs.\n\n\u201cOur grandparents told us, \u2018Take care of them. They\u2019re angels,\u2019\u201d said Homero Gomez Gonz\u00e1lez, the former commissioner of Rosario.\n\nHe remembers the mid-1970s, when the American scientists started to arrive. And then, soon after, the American tourists.\n\n\u201cWe came to believe that the tourism could be good for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t understand about why they end up there,\u201d Oberhauser said.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and other local leaders tried to restore the forest that had been badly damaged by illegal logging, which in turn displaced clusters of butterflies.\n\nThat restoration has largely been successful. But now climate change poses a greater threat.\n\nSome humans are making small efforts to help the monarchs prepare climate change. Here in Rosario, the World Wildlife Fund is planting drought-resistant oyamel trees, which should be able to provide shelter to the monarchs even as temperatures rise. But experts say the effort isn\u2019t likely to change much.\n\n\u201cThe migration will disappear unless we solve climate change,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n[This Brazilian island wants to show the way to a green future.

Gen. Qasem Soleimani. (Chris Seward/AP)\n\nIran has promised severe revenge for the United States\u2019 killing of Qasem Soleimani, the country\u2019s powerful military commander. Across the Middle East, these threats of confrontation have put on high alert the bases, ports and other installations where U.S. troops are based or pass through.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon announced that it was sending an additional 3,500 troops to the region, while troops in Italy were put on standby, according to defense officials. The troop escalation came just days after President Trump ordered an additional 750 U.S. soldiers to the Middle East and 3,000 more to be on alert for future deployment, after pro-Iranian forces stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad as part of a worsening cycle of violence.\n\nTrump plunges toward the kind of Middle Eastern conflict he pledged to avoid\n\nThe United States has tens of thousands of military personnel at bases and aboard ships across the Middle East, as well as arrangements with various countries to move soldiers and military equipment through airstrips and ports. Here\u2019s a look at some of these places, which could now be targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq: Estimated 6,000 troops\n\nU.S. officials won\u2019t say exactly how many troops there are in Iraq or where they are based. There are an estimated 6,000 troops stationed across the country, including in the Green Zone, Baghdad\u2019s walled-off diplomatic area, and at al-Asad Air Base, where Vice President Pence visited U.S. troops in November.\n\nTensions are extremely high in Iraq, which is stuck in the middle of the U.S.-Iranian faceoff. That\u2019s put a spotlight on U.S. citizens and installations there: On Friday, the State Department ordered all American citizens to leave the country.\n\nThen, on Saturday, rockets were fired at the Green Zone and Balad air base, both of which have U.S. troops stationed there. No one was hurt, and such attacks aren\u2019t uncommon. Still, it\u2019s left people bracing for more \u2014 and worse.\n\nSyria: Estimated 800 troops\n\nU.S. officials are also tight-lipped about how many U.S. troops are in Syria and where. As many as 800 remain in the country after the Trump administration abruptly withdrew soldiers in October. At that time, the number was around 2,000. The U.S. garrison at Tanf, by the Syrian-Jordanian border, is now one potential flash point, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group has warned, because Iranian and Iranian-backed forces are deployed nearby.\n\nAfghanistan: Estimated 14,000 troops\n\nAfghanistan, where around 14,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed and which is in southern Asia, could become another \u201carena for U.S.-Iranian contestation,\u201d the ICG has warned. In November, Trump made a surprise visit to troops stationed at Afghanistan\u2019s Bagram air base.\n\nKuwait: About 13,000 troops\n\nThe United States has about 13,000 military personnel spread among several bases in Kuwait, according to the Congressional Research Service. The two countries have had a Defense Cooperation Agreement since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.\n\nJordan: About 3,000 troops\n\nJordan \u2014 bordering Iraq, Syria, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, as well as Saudi Arabia \u2014 is a strategically located U.S. ally. Its Muwaffaq Salti Air Base was an important launching point in the battle against the Islamic State, and there are plans to upgrade the complex. In November 2016, three U.S. soldiers were killed by a Jordanian air force sergeant in a rare shooting at King Faisal Air Base.\n\nSaudi Arabia: Estimated 3,000 troops\n\nIn October, the United States announced that it was sending additional troops to Saudi Arabia as tensions with Iran continued to build. Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been regional rivals: The two are involved in a proxy war in Yemen. Washington has accused Iran of attacking oil and gas facilities in Saudi Arabia, which Iran has denied.\n\nBahrain: More than 7,000 troops\n\nBahrain hosts a U.S. Navy base, where several thousand personnel are stationed or pass through. The island nation is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and has supported Trump\u2019s aggressive stance toward Iran. Bahrain also suppressed a Shiite uprising in 2011, putting it further at odds with Iran\u2019s government.\n\nAboard a U.S. patrol ship in the Persian Gulf, where tensions are spiking\n\nOman: About 600 hundred troops\n\nOman hosts only a few hundred troops. In March, it signed a deal allowing U.S. planes and warships to use some Omani airstrips and ports.\n\nMost important, Oman is along the Arabian Peninsula near the Strait of Hormuz, the world\u2019s most important oil choke point. It\u2019s also where the United States and Iran for months have been engaged in oil tanker standoffs: Since withdrawing from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal almost two years ago, the United States has increased pressure on Iran, including canceling waivers for countries to buy Iranian oil. Iran has in turn threatened to close access to the strait, which would severely constrain access to oil. Washington has also accused Iran of sabotaging oil tankers in the waterway, which Iran has denied.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: Up to 5,000 troops\n\nThe UAE is another country near the Strait of Hormuz that\u2019s been part of the tanker confrontations. It has hosted as many as 5,000 troops in recent years and is traditionally allied with Saudi Arabia and the United States. But rising tensions in the region have put the UAE on edge, and it has taken a somewhat more conciliatory approach to Iran in recent months.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s ambitions backfire as it finds itself on the front line of U.S.-Iranian tensions\n\nQatar: As many as 13,000 troops\n\nQatar is home to al-Udeid, the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. In 2018, Qatar announced a $1.8 billion plan to upgrade the base. The move came as Qatar was battling a blockade by rivals Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAs Trump tries to end \u2018endless wars,\u2019 America\u2019s biggest Mideast base is getting bigger\n\nTurkey: Estimated 2,500 troops\n\nTurkey hosts U.S. troops at Incirlik Air Base, as well as other sites where NATO forces are deployed.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administrations-maximum-pressure-campaign-against-iran-enters-a-new-military-phase/2020/01/04/fe237c5a-2f32-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html", "published": "2020-01-04T13:18:00", "title": "Trump\u2019s turn to military against Iran shows limits of economic \u2018maximum pressure\u2019", "text": "Neither is likely any time soon.\n\nThe sanctions have put the Iranian regime on the ropes economically, but they have not forced the Iranians to change their behavior or negotiate the deal.

The strike against Soleimani, after six months of patience, is one such example.\u201d\n\nWashington and Tehran have been at loggerheads since the 1979 revolution and the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. But previous administrations have avoided direct confrontations and usually taken a more subtle approach. In his 2009 inauguration speech, for example, President Barack Obama promised to \u201cextend a hand\u201d if countries like Iran were willing to \u201cunclench their fists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump came to office determined to undo what he called the \u201cterrible\u201d 2015 nuclear deal the Obama administration negotiated with Iran and six other major powers.\n\nThe term \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d became common foreign policy lingo when former secretary of state Rex Tillerson started using it to describe sanctions against North Korea. The administration also has applied it to the Maduro government in Venezuela. So far, it has not made any government surrender or significantly shift its positions.\n\nBut Iran has been the target of the most maximum-pressure tactics. In one of his first speeches after taking office in 2018, Pompeo threatened Iran with the \u201ctoughest sanctions in history\u201d if it did not meet 12 demands, which included respecting human rights, withdrawing support for \u201cterrorist groups\u201d in neighboring countries and abandoning its missile development.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor a while, Iran continued to meet its commitments under the nuclear deal, even after Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018. But its tactics changed after the United States began imposing more economic punishments.\n\nThe sanctions have been brutal on Iran\u2019s economy, leading to mass protests around the country against fuel price increases. Iran\u2019s leaders have instituted a harsh crackdown, killing at least hundreds of protesters and jailing thousands, human rights groups say. But the punishing sanctions have done did little to alter Iran\u2019s actions or curb its destabilizing influence in the region.\n\nCritics of maximum-pressure sanctions say the policy has backfired.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIran isn\u2019t in a corner; we\u2019re in a corner,\u201d said Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council. \u201cTrump has no good options. What more can the U.S. do now? We\u2019ve sanctioned everything and everybody. What\u2019s left?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIran has fought back against sanctions militarily, first by attacking oil tankers, shooting down a U.S. drone and striking oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, one of its main rivals. When the administration did not respond militarily, Iran became more aggressive.\n\n\u201cIran started to ratchet up more conventional military actions to show it could not be pushed around,\u201d said John Glaser, the Cato Institute\u2019s director of Foreign Policy Studies.\n\nAD\n\nGlaser said the maximum-pressure campaign has worsened the already adversarial relationship between Washington and Tehran.\n\n\u201cTrump came into office with Iran denuclearized and with an open channel of communication in place for the first time in 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there\u2019s no diplomatic channel. They\u2019ve been imposing sanctions without signaling what Iran could do to get them lifted. Pompeo\u2019s demands were a way of saying they will never get lifted, unless they get rid of their entire foreign policy and reform their entire system. Iran saw itself with little option.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince early October, the administration has counted 10 attacks in the Baghdad area alone from militias allied with Iran. A turning point came on Dec. 27, when an American contractor was killed in a rocket attack in northern Iraq. The administration had signaled for months that it would hold Tehran responsible for the acts of militias and responded two days later with airstrikes against five of the group\u2019s facilities Iraq and Syria.\n\nAD\n\nThe conflict escalated when pro-Iran protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on New Year\u2019s Eve, prompting the strike that killed Soleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.\n\nU.S. officials show no signs of backing down from the strategy of maximum pressure and view it as a success. They say the economic devastation has put Iran\u2019s ruling clerics on their heels, ensnaring them in the worst economic and political crisis in their four decades of power as Iranians grow more fed up with the diversion of money to foreign adventures.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaximum pressure has been a successful strategy,\u201d said Fred Fleitz, who worked in the White House as chief of staff to former national security adviser John Bolton and now is president of the Center for Security Policy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put enormous pressure on the Iranian economy. The protests and attacks shows the regime\u2019s desperation. The president is giving Iran a choice. It can start negotiating, or maximum pressure will continue.\u201d\n\nBut Slavin said the Iranian government crackdown has left the opposition leaderless and turned Soleimani into a martyr.\n\nIran\u2019s leaders are \u201cprobably going to play it for everything it\u2019s worth,\u201d she said. \u201cThis regime will survive Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/at-baghdad-funeral-procession-for-qasim-soleimani-calls-for-retaliation-against-the-united-states/2020/01/04/aa02fb10-2e64-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-04T12:12:00", "title": "Trump threatens reprisals against Iran should U.S. assets or Americans come under attack", "text": "Iran immediately vowed to seek revenge for the killing of Soleimani, as the Trump administration announced that it was sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Iranian commander quoted by the Tasnim News Agency on Saturday suggested that dozens of U.S. facilities and military assets in the Middle East were at risk, along with Israel, a key U.S. ally.\n\n\u201cThirty-five vital American positions in the region are within the reach of the Islamic Republic, and Tel Aviv,\u201d the commander, Brig.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin about the potential threat for terrorism in the United States amid the surging tensions, while repeating assurances given earlier this week that U.S. officials do not know of any specific, credible threat to the United States.\n\nThe focal point of the anxiety was Baghdad, where thousands of people joined a funeral procession for Soleimani and Muhandis on Saturday as helicopters shadowed the crowds. \"Death to America, death to Israel,\" people chanted. \"We will take our revenge!\"\n\nThe procession, which began in Baghdad and moved on to the Iraqi Shiite shrine cities of Najaf and Karbala, offered a vivid display of how both Iran and the United States are deeply entwined in Iraq. The crowds bellowed anti-American cries and vowed to fight to avenge one of Iran\u2019s heroes as U.S.-allied Iraqi security forces watched over the chanting throngs. Soleimani\u2019s burial is scheduled for Tuesday in Kerman, his hometown in southeastern Iran.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater Saturday, rockets were fired toward Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone, site of the U.S. Embassy, and at an air base hosting U.S. troops north of Baghdad, but they caused no casualties, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials, who did not say who fired the rockets.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House delivered a formal notification of the drone strike that killed Soleimani to Congress, as is required under the War Powers Act. The report is completely classified, according to a senior Democratic aide, but probably details the administration\u2019s justification for the strike, as well as the constitutional and legislative rationale used to send troops.\n\nIt was unclear whether the administration would issue a nonclassified version that could be publicized.\n\nAD\n\nNATO, which has several hundred personnel in Iraq, said Saturday that it has temporarily suspended its training of Iraqi forces to counter the Islamic State, according to Dylan White, a NATO spokesman. \u201cThe safety of our personnel in Iraq is paramount.

Gen. Ali Fadavi told Iranian State TV that although Soleimani was the senior commander of Iran\u2019s most powerful branch of the prestigious Revolutionary Guard, it might not be Iran that strikes back.\n\n\u201cThe great front of the resistance is geographically ready to carry out this harsh revenge,\u201d he said, a reference to the wider network of Iranian proxy forces, such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, known in Iranian circles as the \u201cAxis of Resistance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat Iran has plenty of options is not in doubt. In his role as the commander of the Quds Force \u2014 the wing of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 charged with exporting Iran\u2019s revolutionary ideology \u2014 Soleimani built a network of loyalist militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen that can be called upon to shield Tehran from direct implication in attacks on U.S. or allied targets.\n\nAD\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a major attack on Saudi oil facilities in September, even though the U.S. government asserted the missile strikes were launched from Iran. In Iraq, U.S. military officials charge that the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia has been carrying out a string of rocket attacks against Iraqi military bases where U.S. troops are located, one of which killed a U.S. contractor late last month, triggering the unexpected escalation that culminated in Soleimani\u2019s killing.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump warned Iran that any strikes against \u201cAmericans or American assets\u201d will bring U.S. retaliation against 52 unspecified Iranian targets \u2014 \u201crepresenting the 52 American hostages\u201d held at the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran after Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.

They include renewed attacks on Persian Gulf shipping, strikes against U.S. or allied military bases around the region, bombs at American embassies and attempts to assassinate or abduct American officials and citizens.\n\nBut it remains unclear what Iran can do that surpasses the attacks it has already carried out without provoking a bigger escalation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince May, Iran has been harassing ships and firing rockets at American troops in Iraq as part of a strategy overseen by Soleimani to punish the United States for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and imposing the harsh economic sanctions that have devastated Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nMultiple tweets by Trump deriding \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East, his abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria, and his last-minute retreat from a threat to retaliate for the downing of an American drone had all fueled confidence in Tehran that Iran could play on Trump\u2019s aversion to war by needling him with relatively small-scale attacks and perhaps weaken his resolve.\n\nBut what more can Iran do that \u201cit has not already done?\u201d Rasha al-Aqeedi, who edits the Iraqi newsletter Irfaa Sawtak, said in a tweet. \u201cKidnap foreigners?

Send out militias to crackdown on adversaries?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIran is facing constraints on its room to maneuver in many of those places, said Hanin Ghaddar, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. So extensive is the reach of its influence that its allies have become integral components of the governments in Iraq and Lebanon, making Iran a target of widespread anti-government protests in recent months.\n\nMilitias backed by Soleimani have played a big part in crackdowns against the protesters in both countries, and there were videos showing celebrations by some Iraqi activists at the news of his death.\n\n\u201cIran cannot go to war in the region. In Iraq their options are becoming very limited for them because any escalation in Iraq exposes them to more attacks by the U.S.,\u201d Ghaddar said. \u201cIn Lebanon it\u2019s going to be difficult because of the financial crisis. They cannot fund a war in Lebanon or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most likely arena for an escalation is in Iraq, where the spiral of confrontation began and where Soleimani was killed, analysts say. Rockets fired Saturday into the Green Zone in Baghdad and at Balad Air Base, where U.S. troops are present, suggested Iran intends to keep up the pressure on Iraq.\n\nThe killing of Soleimani on Iraqi soil and the airstrikes last Sunday that killed 25 members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia have fueled calls for the expulsion of U.S. troops from Iraq. On Saturday, the Iraqi army said it would impose new restrictions on the 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq to help with the fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\"My sense is that we will see an escalation in Iraq,\" said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. \"But I don't think the Iranians really want a war with the U.S. I don't think they are interested in an all-out regional conflict.\"\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/03/does-president-have-consult-congress-reporters-answer-readers-questions-about-us-strike-that-killed-soleimani/", "published": "2020-01-04T08:52:57", "title": "\u2018Does the president have to consult Congress?\u2019: Reporters answer readers\u2019 questions about U.S. strike that killed Soleimani", "text": "WHO WAS SOLEIMANI?\n\nQ. What was Qasem Soleimani\u2019s impact on the fight against ISIS?\n\n\u2014 Ahmad J.\n\nA. Major. He directed Iran\u2019s irregular military efforts against the Islamic State, making him for a time an uneasy partner with U.S.-led efforts. There was never any formal alliance, of course, but the Quds Force and U.S. forces were seeking the same goal \u2014 pushing the Islamic State out of territory it had captured in Iraq and Syria. Iran has also protected Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while U.S. policy is that Assad is an illegitimate leader. \u2014 Anne Gearan\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ. Who are the members of the Quds Force? Are they local fighters or Iranian mercenaries?\n\n\u2014 Charles A.\n\nA. The Quds Force is an elite unit of fighters and operatives within the already elite Revolutionary Guard Corps. It\u2019s estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 members are tasked with carrying out missions abroad and other intelligence-gathering missions. They also support Iran\u2019s proxy militias abroad, such as Hezbollah in Iran and Shiite militias in Iran, among others. The Quds Force is made up of Iranians mainly chosen because of their skills and allegiance to the Islamic revolution. \u2014 Miriam Berger\n\nQ. Who will replace Soleimani, and what is that person\u2019s background?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 A. Hose\n\nA. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has already appointed Soleimani\u2019s deputy, Gen. Ismail Qaani, as the slain commander\u2019s replacement and vowed that the Quds Force will carry on as before. Like Soleimani, Qaani is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war of 1980 to 1988. From there, he rose in the ranks to become the deputy commander of the Quds Force. In another similarity with Soleimani, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Qaani in 2012 for his support of Iran\u2019s allies in the region. Unlike Soleimani, Qaani does not have a cultlike aura surrounding him. \u2014 M.B.\n\nAD\n\nHOW DID THE ATTACK PLAY OUT?\n\nQ. Why was Soleimani in Baghdad? Does the Iraqi government regularly countenance the presence of destabilizing elements in the country, traveling back and forth without restriction? Was he traveling as a diplomatic representative of the Iranian regime?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Dan G.\n\nA. Soleimani had flown into Baghdad for meetings, but we do not know for certain exactly what he was there to discuss. U.S. officials have claimed he was planning attacks against American troops and diplomats in Iraq. Soleimani was killed along with an Iraqi and pro-Iranian Shiite militia leader, known by the nickname Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who founded the group Kataib Hezbollah that the United States hit with airstrikes last weekend in Iraq \u2014 and whose supporters then stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq on Tuesday. It was not uncommon for Soleimani to travel to Iraq \u2014 it was basically part of his job as the commander of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, which oversees military operations abroad for the Revolutionary Guard. As part of this work, Soleimani reported directly to Khamenei and was tasked with developing and managing Iran\u2019s proxy militias and political relationships abroad. The Iraqi government, set up in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, is by design sectarian: Over the years, Soleimani has cultivated close relationships with many Shiite politicians, along with militias, in Iraq as part of Iran\u2019s regional strategy. \u2014 M.B.\n\nAD\n\nQ. What ordnance was used to carry out the attack? Was it a smart bomb launched from an aircraft? A cruise missile?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Marc B.\n\nA. A U.S. official has said the attack was carried out from an unpiloted aircraft, or drone. That would mean that one or more shorter-range missiles were fired from the air, but we do not yet know the type of missiles or how far away the drone was at the time. Presumably the drone was in Iraqi airspace. \u2014 A.G.\n\nWHY DID TRUMP APPROVE THE ATTACK? WAS IT LEGAL?\n\nQ. Was the strike necessary or was Trump trying to detract from his impeachment woes?\n\n\u2014 W. Harvey\n\nA. We can\u2019t fully assess whether the strike was necessary right now, because we don\u2019t know a great deal about the intelligence that the administration says it assessed before carrying out the strike. The administration said it was necessary because of the imminent threat of new violence directed by Soleimani. Trump may be seeking ways to distract from impeachment, but the question of whether he was justified in choosing this exact moment to kill Soleimani is murky. The attack that killed a U.S. contractor a week ago was the first event in this sequence that led to the U.S. attack early Friday, and the White House points to it in blaming Iran for starting the fight. \u2014 A.G.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ. Does the president have to consult Congress before acting against an individual or country that poses an imminent danger (i.e. actually attacking U.S. citizens), or is consultation with Congress just good management and leadership? What does the law say in these cases?\n\n\u2014 D.F.\n\nA. No, the president is not legally bound to consult with Congress when an act of national defense is deemed an emergency. Congress is given the constitutional power to declare war, but no U.S. wars have been congressionally \u201cdeclared\u201d for decades. Instead, the president is given leeway to conduct warlike actions that everyone calls a war but that Congress doesn\u2019t have to endorse with a vote. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), among others, has railed against this for years, essentially calling it a usurpation of power by the White House and an act of cowardice on the part of Congress. Past presidents have almost always found it prudent to consult with or inform at least a small group of national security leaders in Congress. \u2014 A.G.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ. Is there a consensus among military scholars that Iran can legitimately argue the Soleimani assassination is an \u201cact of war?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tim M.\n\nA. There is not consensus, but many scholars voicing opinions today about the law of warfare do categorize this an act of war. The White House says this was preventive, which is a defense against the charge that the killing violated international law. On its face, the act was a hostile one and thus potentially warlike: A foreign government figure was targeted off the battlefield. The Trump administration will probably argue that Soleimani was indeed \u201con the battlefield,\u201d because he was arriving in Iraq from Syria and, they claim, planning new attacks in U.S. interests. \u2014 A.G.\n\nAD\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nQ. How would the military capabilities of Iran now compare with those of Iraq, pre-invasion? In recent history, are there any examples of the United States taking similar actions against an agent of a country that has a military with similar capabilities to those of Iran?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Ryan S.\n\nA. Iran has the second-best military in the Middle East. The best is Israel\u2019s, and not by coincidence. Iran is wealthy despite U.S. sanctions and has an effective, multilayered military system with regular and irregular forces, plus proxy militias in several countries or territories. Iran\u2019s military is generally considered to be much better than it was before the eight-year Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and more modern and disciplined than Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi forces in 2003. Trump has said Iran should not try to start a war, because it would lose quickly, but there is little doubt that Iran could do a great deal of damage to U.S. forces or allies. As to U.S. examples, I can\u2019t think of any. The United States has carried out targeted killings of individual terrorist leaders, but those were not government officials. It\u2019s worth noting that the United States did engineer the overthrow of Iran\u2019s elected prime minister in 1953, though it didn\u2019t kill him. \u2014 A.G."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-war-weary-baghdad-fears-that-us-and-iran-showdowns-could-leave-iraq-caught-in-the-middle/2020/01/04/6378f87a-2f09-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-04T08:42:00", "title": "In Baghdad, fears that U.S.-Iran showdowns could leave Iraq caught in middle", "text": "The attack has shaken Iraq, sharpening long-standing fears that the country\u2019s soil will become home, again, for a bloody shadow war between Washington and Tehran.

The strikes were carried out in response to the death of a U.S. contractor in a rocket attack against a military base in Kirkuk that the United States blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWhat happens next: Soleimani\u2019s killing could be a catalyst for greater violence, experts warned. Iran vowed \u201csevere revenge\u201d in response, while U.S. outposts braced for retaliatory attacks and oil prices rose. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq warned U.S. citizens to leave \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nWant to understand world news better?

(Australian Maritime Safety Authority/Reuters)\n\nAs southeast Australia burned Saturday, the word carried on the wind was \"unprecedented.\" The continent has seen massive wildfire outbreaks before, but this one has been different. There are so many fires in so many places \u2014 about 200 at last count \u2014 and many are in novel terrain, including rainforests and the suburbs of Sydney.\n\nThe flames have taken the lives of a dozen people in the past week, killed untold numbers of koalas and other animals, destroyed more than a thousand structures, forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate, choked cities with smoke and rendered the famed Sydney Opera House nearly invisible on the city\u2019s harbor. The smoke has reached the lower stratosphere and crossed 9,000 miles of ocean to pollute the skies of South America.\n\nSaturday was one of the worst days yet in a stretch of dangerous fire weather \u2014 blazing heat, parched brush and winds that topped 60 miles per hour. It was the hottest day on record in metropolitan Sydney, with the town of Penrith hitting 120 degrees, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The national capital, Canberra, set a record high with a temperature of 110 degrees.\n\nThe national government on Saturday began calling up 3,000 army reservists to conduct evacuations and help people in remote areas affected by the wildfire emergency. But the chief firefighter in New South Wales, Shane Fitzsimmons, complained Sunday that he didn\u2019t know about the deployment until he saw the news on TV. He said he called the prime minister\u2019s office for details.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that on one of our worst days this season, to hear that announcement, then have to try to work through on top of everything else what it means and how it is going to operate,\u201d he said in a television interview.\n\nRoads have closed, and many residents and summer vacationers have been trapped in coastal towns and told to flee the flames by boat if there is no other option. More than 1,000 people and 113 dogs reached Melbourne on Saturday on two navy ships, the Sycamore and the Choules, which evacuated them from seaside towns ringed by fires.\n\nIn southern New South Wales state, people in a 70-mile coastal stretch were warned it was too late to leave the area and told to seek shelter, as an out-of-control blaze that had consumed more than 1,000 square miles of forest and farmland \u2014 more than 40 times the size of Manhattan \u2014 burned toward the Pacific Ocean and threatened to cut off escape routes. This season\u2019s fires have burned through an area at least the size of West Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Sanctuary Point, a normally bustling vacation town, 13 of the 18 shops on the main street were closed Saturday. Shopkeepers said the staff and owners had either left town or were preparing to defend their houses. Those who remained waited anxiously for a southerly change that could whip up the fire, and they kept watch for embers, which fire officials have said can ignite trees, leaves and grass up to seven miles ahead of a fire front.\n\nAround midday, Helen Bowerman was pouring water into the guttering on her concrete-block and metal-roof house. With the air smelling of smoke, the 66-year-old said she was worried that tall trees on an adjacent property could catch fire and collapse.\n\nShould the fire reach her, Bowerman said, she planned to dive into a large estuary next to her house. A neighbor had kayaks ready to go. \u201cWe all look out for each other and help each other out,\u201d she said.\n\nFarrugia Sammut, 82, said she had not been as scared since her childhood home in Malta was bombed during World War II. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded\u201d by wildfires, the former factory worker said. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night for the worry.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Houses were exploding\u2019: In Australia\u2019s fire horror, heartbreak and relief]\n\n\n\nFirefighters drag a hose after putting out a blaze near Moruya in New South Wales, Australia, on Saturday. (Rick Rycroft/AP)\n\nOn Sunday, the Aussies got a break meteorologically. The cold front that blasted through Saturday brought more comfortable temperatures and the promise of a few calmer days.\n\nBut that same cold front had also delivered high winds through Saturday night, creating fresh emergencies as it pushed the conflagrations northward into new terrain. Four firefighters were injured overnight \u2014 three from smoke inhalation and a fourth from burns to his hands. Hundreds more houses had been destroyed, according to a fire brigade spokesman.\n\nDespite the improved conditions, fire authorities said it wasn\u2019t safe for people in many coastal towns to leave by road. The main highway south from Sydney to the coast was cut off by flames and smoke overnight in several locations. The highway linking Sydney and Melbourne \u2014 Australia\u2019s two largest cities \u2014 was also closed.\n\nMore than 1,000 people spent the night at an emergency shelter in Bega, a town in southern New South Wales surrounded by national parks, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nThis past year was the hottest on record in Australia \u2014 and also the driest. The lethal combination has underwritten a fire season that started early, in September, and shows no sign of abating. The death toll since the fire season began stands at 23. The fires are so extreme that the weather bureau has warned of lightning strikes from what are called pyro-cumulonimbus clouds \u2014 fire-spawned thunderheads built of smoke, towering to 45,000 feet and generating ground-level convection that makes firefighting harder.\n\nForecasters do not anticipate any significant rain in the scorched regions for months.\n\n[On land, Australia\u2019s rising heat is \u2018apocalyptic.\u2019 In the ocean, it\u2019s worse.]\n\nThis natural disaster is also a political flash point. The fires are a vivid signal of the global crisis of climate change, which can make ecological conditions more suitable to the ignition and intensification of wildfires. Climate change has been a divisive topic in Australia for years, a wedge issue that has decided elections.\n\nIn the past, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has downplayed the importance of tackling climate change and has offered full-throated support for coal mining. The fires have created the biggest test of that position, and of Morrison\u2019s leadership, since his conservatives unexpectedly won a general election in May.\n\nEven on a dry continent accustomed to fatal wildfires, footage of hundreds of civilians being evacuated by sea triggered a sense among many Australians that climate change poses an immediate threat to the nation, one of the world\u2019s largest coal exporters. Three weeks ago, the country recorded its highest nationally averaged temperatures \u2014 twice in two days.\n\nAlready, the devastation has fueled calls for Morrison \u2014 who once brandished a lump of coal in Parliament to underline his support for mining \u2014 to take more concerted action on climate change. Australia\u2019s share of global carbon dioxide emissions from domestic use of fossil fuels is about 1.4 percent, according to Climate Analytics, but the country is one of the highest emitters per capita.\n\n\u201cThe best response I can provide to people who are feeling angry and isolated, people who are feeling afraid, is what I can do today,\u201d Morrison said at a news briefing in Canberra, flanked by the minister of defense and the chief of the defense forces. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take action on climate change.\u201d\n\n[Australia\u2019s prime minister visited families devastated by the wildfires. It did not go well.]\n\n\n\nSmoke covers the skyline as fires approach the Princes Highway at Bodalla in New South Wales on Saturday. (Brett Hemmings/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe fires have also undermined Morrison\u2019s reputation as a man in touch with middle Australia.\n\nThe prime minister, who was snubbed and heckled by exhausted and angry firefighters and survivors in recent days, ordered what the government said was the first major use of military reserves to respond to this type of natural disaster. He also touted, in a promotional video, an Australian navy ship that has been ordered to the border between the states of New South Wales and Victoria to help evacuate people.\n\nThese moves followed criticism of Morrison\u2019s decision to vacation in Hawaii after the fires began, and there is a perception that state-based firefighting services have been overwhelmed by blazes that have destroyed more than 1,300 homes.\n\n\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d said Geoff Monkhouse, a 76-year-old retired electrical contractor who was drinking beer at a Sanctuary Point country club on Saturday. \u201cHe should not go smiling around people that are suffering.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s deadliest wildfire disaster was in February 2009, when 173 people were killed.\n\nOn Saturday, Andrew Constance, a conservative lawmaker from southern New South Wales, compared the fires in his region to \u201can atomic bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable the hell it\u2019s caused and the devastation it\u2019s caused,\u201d he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.\n\nConditions beginning to deteriorate quickly on #NSW southern firegrounds. #Heat & #Wind are building which is increasing fire activity.

His listeners told tales of retching as they drove around the city. The fires are right up against the Sydney suburbs, an unfamiliar experience for residents.\n\nIn an email, Glover described the nature of the disaster, with office workers wearing breathing masks and senior citizens pressing hankies to their mouths as they walk the streets:\n\n\u201cThere are the unprecedented fish deaths in our inland rivers; the unprecedented level-one fire warning for Sydney; the unprecedented day of blazes in every state and territory.\u201d\n\nHe summed up the mood: \u201cGnawing anxiety is everywhere, together with enormous gratitude and admiration for the \u2018thin yellow line\u2019 of volunteer fire-fighters who are standing in the way of the flames.\u201d\n\n1 of 32 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 In photos: Australia sees worst wildfires in decades View Photos Thousands flee coastal towns as the fires close in.

Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was a larger-than-life figure and deft architect of Iran\u2019s success in building loyal proxy forces in the Middle East. It is a network that Tehran used to help defeat the Islamic State and to project military and political power in places such as Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the bespectacled Qaani \u2014 whose portfolio as deputy included Quds Force operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asian republics \u2014 boasts few notable military victories. Instead, experts say, he is believed to have focused on the organization\u2019s day-to-day administrative affairs.\n\n\u201cQaani\u2019s war-era record does not display the same degree of distinction as Soleimani\u2019s,\u201d said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington and author of \u201cIran Unveiled: How the Revolutionary Guards are Transforming Iran from Theocracy Into Military Dictatorship.\u201d\n\nArash Azizi, a New York-based writer who is researching a forthcoming book on Iran\u2019s external military operations, said: \u201cQaani was presumed to be the heir apparent for a long time. But he\u2019s very bureaucratic \u2014 he does not have Soleimani\u2019s charisma.\n\n\u201cAs someone who works in Iran\u2019s national security apparatus, he hasn\u2019t really distinguished himself,\u201d Azizi said.\n\nWhat the obscure new commander brings, however, is continuity in the face of an extraordinary blow to the Quds Force\u2019s leadership, analysts say. As deputy commander, a position he assumed in the late 1990s or early 2000s, according to reports, he possesses intimate knowledge of the force\u2019s inner workings and covert activities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUnder Qaani\u2019s leadership, there is likely to be greater continuity than change in the Quds Force,\u201d Alfoneh said.\n\n\u201cI suspect he\u2019ll have little difficulty filling Soleimani\u2019s shoes when it comes to operations and strategy,\u201d said Afshon Ostovar, author of \u201cVanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards.\u201d\n\nQaani first joined the Revolutionary Guard as a young man in 1980, when it was a nascent force tasked with protecting the Islamic Republic. He soon became division commander, leading battles in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and oversaw operations in northeastern Iran, where he was born.\n\nThere, according to Alfoneh, Qaani likely helped facilitate support for Afghanistan\u2019s Northern Alliance, a group of fighters that sought to overthrow the Taliban, a Sunni militant movement that came to power in 1996.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1998, when Taliban forces attacked Iran\u2019s consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, killing nine diplomats, Qaani was instrumental in dissuading Tehran\u2019s leadership from responding militarily, Azizi said.\n\n\u201cMany people were eager for Iran to take action,\u201d Azizi said. \u201cIt was an act of maturity on Qaani\u2019s part in deciding not do anything rash.\u201d\n\nQaani and his predecessor appear to have divided the labor: Soleimani operated on Iran\u2019s western front, while Qaani\u2019s focus remained on its eastern borders.\n\nQaani also once traveled with Iran\u2019s then-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to several countries in Africa and South America. In 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Qaani for overseeing the distribution of Quds Force funding to regional allies. He also was responsible for a weapons shipment to Gambia that was intercepted in Nigeria in 2010, the department said.\n\nHe is also believed to have to have played a prominent role in establishing Liwa al-Fatemiyoun, a military brigade of mostly Afghan Shiite Hazaras who were deployed to Syria to assist government forces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2012, Qaani was the first Revolutionary Guard commander to publicly acknowledge Iran\u2019s military presence in Syria, telling an Iranian news outlet that because of Iran\u2019s involvement in the war, \u201cbig massacres were prevented.\u201d\n\n\u201cQaani seems to be a more cagey personality than his predecessor,\u201d Ostovar said. \u201cBut like Soleimani, Qaani seems to have a strong personal relationship with the supreme leader.\u201d\n\nQaani\u2019s decades-long career at the highest levels of the Revolutionary Guard \u201csays a lot about the trust both Khamenei and Soleimani had in him,\u201d Ostovar said.\n\nStill, experts say, Qaani lacks broader experience in the Arab world, an area crucial to Iran\u2019s efforts to counter U.S. and Israeli military power.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that he speaks Arabic, and he doesn\u2019t have the same understanding of the Arab world or of Israel that Soleimani had,\u201d said Azizi.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Ostovar, \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that Qaani\u2019s friendships with proxy commanders are as well-developed or run as deep as Soleimani\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he will \u201cprobably run operations primarily from a distance,\u201d Ostovar said. \u201cEven if he wanted to replicate Soleimani\u2019s general-on-the-front-lines photo ops, it\u2019ll be difficult for him to do now.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/thailand-launches-full-time-clinics-dispensing-cannabis-oil/2020/01/06/5d69446c-306c-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html", "published": "2020-01-06T10:07:37", "title": "Thailand launches full-time clinics dispensing cannabis oil", "text": "The initial four formulations handed out are used for treating conditions such as migraines, insomnia, nausea, numbness and pain.

Officials have warned that the rain won\u2019t put out the largest and most dangerous blazes before conditions deteriorate again.\n\nAD\n\nVictoria state Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said at least 200 millimeters (8 inches) of rain would need to fall over a short period of time in order to snuff out the fires \u2014 around 20 times what has fallen across the region in the past day. And officials warned that the country\u2019s wildfire season \u2014 which generally lasts through March \u2014 was nowhere near its end.\n\n\u201cNo one can be complacent. We\u2019ve got big fire danger coming our way toward the end of this week,\u201d Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne. \u201cWe are by no means out of this. And the next few days, and indeed the next few months, are going to be challenging.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian also urged Australians not to let their guards down.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, overnight, it\u2019s become apparent that we have two people unaccounted for in New South Wales,\u201d she said at a news conference, adding she still held out hope for some good news to emerge about them.\n\nAD\n\nAustralia\u2019s capital, Canberra, had the worst air quality of any major city in the world on Monday. The Department of Home Affairs, which is responsible for coordinating the country\u2019s response to disasters, told all non-critical staff to stay home because of thick smoke choking the city.\n\nThe prime minister said the military was attempting to get food, fuel and water to burned-out communities, and engineers were working to reopen roads and resupply evacuation centers. On Kangaroo Island, a refuge off the coast of South Australia for some of the country\u2019s most endangered creatures, teams had arrived to help euthanize livestock and wild animals injured in the blazes. Hundreds of millions of animals are believed to have died already in the fires across the country.\n\nAD\n\nHeavy smoke, meanwhile, was hampering the navy\u2019s efforts to airlift people out of Mallacoota, a coastal town in Victoria cut off for days by fires that forced as many as 4,000 residents and tourists to shelter on beaches over the weekend. Around 300 people were still waiting to be evacuated on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s announcement of relief funds comes as he finds himself under siege for what many Australians have viewed as his lax response to the crisis. On Saturday, he announced he would dispatch 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists to help battle the fires and committed 20 million Australian dollars ($14 million) to lease firefighting aircraft from overseas.\n\nBut the moves did little to tamp down the criticism that he had been slow to act, even as he has downplayed the need for his government to address climate change, which experts say helps supercharge the blazes.\n\nAD\n\nWildfires are common during the southern hemisphere summer, and Australians generally take a pragmatic view of them. But this year\u2019s fires arrived unusually early, fed by drought and the country\u2019s hottest and driest year on record.\n\nAD\n\nScientists say there\u2019s no doubt man-made global warming has played a major role in feeding the fires, along with factors like very dry brush and trees and strong winds.\n\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace said the relief funds announced by Morrison were \u201ca drop in the ocean,\u201d given the widespread devastation from the fires.\n\n\u201cEvery single cent of that money should be contributed by the coal, gas and oil companies whose carbon pollution has caused the climate crisis that has created these extreme fire conditions, right across the country,\u201d Greenpeace Australia Pacific Head of Campaigns Jamie Hanson said in a statement. \u201cSlugging everyday taxpayers with the bill for this just adds insult to injury. These big polluters have become rich by trashing our climate and it\u2019s time that they started coughing up for the repair bill.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
