The deal was implemented in 2016, freezing Iran's nuclear program in return for a progressive lifting of international sanctions.\n\nThe announcement said \"Iran will set its limits based on its technical needs,\" essentially rendering the JCPOA redundant if technically still alive.\n\nIt was the fifth step in Iran's graduated divorce from the nuclear deal, the latest stage in a gradual chipping away at its provisions that began last July in response to US withdrawal from the deal and re-imposition of tough sanctions.\n\nEssentially Iran no longer recognizes any limits on the operational aspects of its nuclear program; including in enrichment capacity, the extent (or degree) of enrichment, and nuclear research and development.\n\nIn other words, Iran is prepared to let its nuclear centrifuges spin.\n\nBut it also held out an olive branch. Foreign Minister Mohamed Javid Zarif tweeted: \"This step is within JCPOA & all 5 steps are reversible upon EFFECTIVE implementation of reciprocal obligations. Iran's full cooperation w/IAEA will continue.\"\n\nA separate statement said Iran would \"continue to work with international nuclear agencies and will return to JCPOA limits once all sanctions are removed from the country.\"\n\nAnalysts noted that even as the JCPOA lurches towards irrelevance, Iran has shown a measure of self-restraint.\n\nHans Kristensen, Director of Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists said \"This does not (yet) mean Iran is leaving JCPOA or building nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"Apparently, other limits of agreement are still in place as is IAEA inspections,\" Kristensen tweeted.\n\n\"Its 5th step away from its JCPOA commitments is less harsh than the initially feared resumption of 20% enrichment,\" tweeted Ali Vaez, Director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. \"This shows Iran still wants the Europeans on its side and doesn't want to break the deal yet.\"\n\nEric Brewer, a former official at the US National Security Council, agreed. He told CNN: \"They've clearly left themselves room to maneuver,\" Brewer said. \"And they clearly chose not to come out with something more aggressive in the wake of Soleimani's death - like increasing enrichment to 20%.\"\n\nBrewer said that the bigger question \"is whether Iran acts on this announcement by adding more centrifuges.\" That could potentially push it closer to developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhat matters is what Iran does next.\n\nMichael Singh, a senior director at the Washington Institute and formerly a senior director for the Middle East at the NSC, told CNN: \"If it is just an announcement in principle, that they do not consider themselves bound by the JCPOA, it will be met with a shrug by the US and others.\" But \"If they follow it up and take actions to increase the levels by which they enrich uranium or increase their stockpile that will actually bring down the breakout time.\"\n\nVipin Narang, Associate Professor of Political Science at MIT, points out that despite Iran's announcement that it won't abide by enrichment levels and quantities set by the JCPOA, \"it is still quite far from having enough enriched uranium for a bomb, let alone a functional arsenal because...of the JCPOA.\"\n\nA deal undone\n\nThe Trump Administration unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA on May 8, 2018.\n\n\"This was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,\" Trump said as he withdrew from the deal. \"It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.\"\n\nThe other parties to the deal -- China, Russia, the Europeans and Iran -- disagreed and stayed the course. But the reimposition of draconian sanctions by the US, sanctions that had been largely lifted as Iran's reward for signing up to the deal, gnawed away at its credibility.\n\nAs tensions grew, the agreement known as the JCPOA began to fray at the edges.\n\nThe Trump administration's policy of \"maximum pressure\" against Iran, which began after that May statement, included crippling sanctions against its financial and oil sectors. President Hassan Rouhani said last week that the US \"economic war\" against Iran had cost the country $200 billion. Iran has lost nearly 90% of its oil exports, a key source of revenue; the value of the rial has plummeted, and the banking sector is under stress. Even though the sanctions exempted essential supplies, widespread shortages of food, medicine and medicinal goods have been reported throughout Iran\n\nTehran responded to the US measures with what it called \"strategic patience\" -- while nagging the Europeans to make up for the effect of US sanctions.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France tried to smooth the waters, proposing a $15 billion credit line for Iran in return for its full adherence to the JCPOA. He also welcomed Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the G7 meeting in August and tried to engineer a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the UN General assembly.\n\nBut the dynamics were moving in the opposite direction. As the noose tightened on Iran's oil exports, it retaliated on several fronts: attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf (by its own or proxy forces), a growing drumbeat of rocket attacks against US forces in Iraq, and most spectacularly the cruise missile attacks against Saudi oil plants in September.\n\nThe message was simple -- if we can't sell our oil and gain the proceeds, we will try to ensure others can't either.\n\nThe reactor building at the Russian-built Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran, pictured in October 2010.\n\nAt the same time, Iran chipped away at the JCPOA. Beginning in July last year, it withdrew every two months from some part of the agreement. It exceeded agreed limits to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, and then began enriching uranium.\n\nEssentially, Iran was responding to America's 'maximum pressure' with 'maximum resistance' -- but short of open war. The two adversaries seemed set on a \"no-peace, no-war\" course of attrition.\n\nThat remains the case after Soleimani's killing, for all the anger and cries for revenge emanating from Tehran. The Iranians and their proxies will probably seek out targets of opportunity around the world. But -- as the Iranian leadership has already stressed -- they will bide their time.\n\nAt the same time, the prognosis for the JCPOA looks poor. At best it's in intensive care; at worst it may struggle to survive the year.\n\nThere's been an almost helpless tone to European calls for restraint in the aftermath of the US drone strikes. France pleaded for Iran to \"quickly return to full compliance with its nuclear obligations and to refrain from further action to the contrary.\"\n\nOn Saturday, France, Germany and China called on Iran to preserve the deal and to avoid any measure that would violate it, according to a statement from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Le Drian spoke to Germany's Heiko Maas and China's Wang Yi in separate phone calls.\n\nThere is scant chance of Iran listening in the current environment. The Europeans are nowhere near making up for the cost and dislocation caused by US sanctions, the $15 billion line of credit has gone nowhere and the Iranian economy is deep in recession. Further and deeper withdrawals from the JCPOA are likely in the months to come.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Iran will abandon the deal altogether and race towards developing a nuclear weapon. Eric Brewer and Ariane Tabatabai have written in War on the Rocks that Iranian policy is \"designed to gradually build pressure on the United States and Europe by targeting key pillars of the agreement, rather than racing for a short-notice breakout capability.\"\n\nThere is still plenty of strategic patience in Tehran. In light of the country's deepening economic crisis and the sporadic flare-up of popular protests, the leadership may decide that upping the ante against the US is unaffordable, and full-scale war unsustainable.\n\nBy comparison, threatening to abandon the nuclear restraints so painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration is almost risk and cost-free.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/04/middleeast/iran-soleimani-nuclear-deal-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-01-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Exclusive: Iran's response to US will be military -- Khamenei's adviser", "text": "Tehran, Iran (CNN) The military adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader said Sunday that Tehran's response to the killing by the United States of its most most influential general will \"for sure be military.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN in Tehran, the adviser -- Maj. Gen. Hossein Dehghan -- made the most specific and direct threat yet by a senior Iranian official following the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nDehghan said Iran would retaliate directly against US \"military sites.\"\n\nDehghan is a former defense minister and is now the main military adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He told CNN that reprisals would come from Iran itself, not its allied militia in the region.\n\n\"It might be argued that there could be proxy operations. We can say America, Mr. Trump, has taken action directly against us -- so we take direct action against America.\"\n\nThe United States has a growing military presence in the region. Thousands of US troops have been deployed to Saudi Arabia, and there are some 5,000 at bases in Iraq. The US also has a major air base in Qatar and a naval presence in Bahrain, as well as troops stationed in Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn common with other Iranian officials, Dehghan suggested that Iran was in no hurry to retaliate and would choose its targets carefully. \"Our reaction will be wise, well considered and in time, with decisive deterrent effect.\"\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani had earlier said that Americans would face consequences for killing Soleimani \"not only today, but also in the coming years.\"\n\nGiven the rhetoric of both sides, there is a growing risk of escalation in what has become the most dangerous confrontation between the US and Iran in decades.\n\nLate Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that \"If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!\"\n\nThe President continued: \"They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!\"\n\nDehghan responded defiantly to Trump's warning.\n\n\"It was America that has started the war. Therefore, they should accept appropriate reactions to their actions,\" he said.\n\n\"The only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow they have inflicted. Afterward they should not seek a new cycle.\"\n\nIn recent months, officials in the Trump administration and even the President himself have floated the possibility of renewed dialogue with Iran. Dehghan dismissed that possibility.\n\n\"Look, for several reasons we didn't want to negotiate with this incumbent US administration. Now, after what happened to Mr. Soleimani there is no point for negotiations or relations. It's impossible.\"\n\nPhotos: US airstrike in Baghdad kills Iran's top general Mourners throng the car carrying the body of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani during a funeral procession for Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad on January 4.

The number was chosen to match the number of hostages taken in the 1979 takeover of the US Embassy, Trump said.\n\nDehghan said the tweets were ridiculous and absurd. \"If he says 52 we say 300 -- and they are accessible to us,\" Dehghan said. \"No American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe.\n\n\"He doesn't know international law. He doesn't recognize UN resolutions either. Basically he is a veritable gangster and a gambler.\"\n\nAt one point in the interview, Dehghan pulled out a picture of Soleimani and held it up to the camera.\n\n\"All Iranians are Qasem Soleimani,\" he said, and insisted the Quds force, which Soleimani had led since 2003, would not be weakened by his death. The Quds have been responsible for projecting Iranian influence across the Middle East and beyond and have played a major role in supporting the Assad regime in Syria.\n\n\"The person who has replaced him has been cooperating with him for two decades. He has the same manner and method,\" Dehghan said.\n\nIran's will to defend its interests \"has increased a thousand times. We don't feel anything. We have a logic, the logic of martyrdom.\"\n\nAs the war of words escalates, Dehghan echoed the comments of other senior Iranian officials that the country was not seeking war.\n\n\"Let me tell you one thing: Our leadership has officially announced that we have never been seeking war and we will not be seeking war.\"\n\nBut his demand that the US not respond to any reprisals by Iran for Soleimani's killing will surely fall on deaf ears.

At least six people were killed in the strike, an Iraqi security source told CNN on condition of anonymity.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ismail Qaani, who served for years alongside Soleimani, has been appointed his replacement.\n\nIt marks a major escalation in regional tensions that have pitted Tehran against Washington and its allies in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said Soleimani was plotting \"imminent and sinister attacks\" on Americans.\n\nThe Pentagon blamed Soleimani and Iran-backed Iraqi militias for recent assaults on coalition bases in Iraq, including a December 27 strike that killed an American civilian contractor and wounded several US and Iraqi military personnel.\n\nAfter retaliatory US airstrikes against the militias last month, hundreds of protesters stormed the US Embassy compound in Baghdad on December 31, an attack the US blamed on Soleimani.\n\nSoleimani was the head of Quds Force, an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps unit in charge of foreign operations, and he became the architect of Tehran's proxy conflicts in the Middle East. The Pentagon blamed Soleimani for hundreds of deaths of Americans and their allies over the years.\n\nIran says it will fight back\n\nRockets hit parts of Baghdad on Saturday, including the parade grounds in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone and the Al-Jadriya area just south of the Green Zone, injuring no one, the Iraqi army said.

No injuries were reported.\n\nSeparately, an Iraqi civilian contractor there told CNN that four rockets landed outside the base's southern gate.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear who fired the rockets. It's not uncommon for rockets to be fired at US positions in Iraq.\n\nDuring Rouhani's visit with Soleimani's family Saturday, Soleimani's daughter asked him: \"Who will take revenge for my father?\"\n\n\"Everyone will take revenge,\" he replied, in video aired by Iranian state television.\n\nIn a letter to the United Nations, Iran described the attack as state terrorism and an unlawful criminal act. European officials and the UN have called for de-escalation.\n\nIt was \"tantamount to opening a war,\" Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" on Friday.

Authorities in the United States are increasing vigilance and fortifying defenses\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf issued a new National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin. \"Iran maintains a robust cyber program and can execute cyberattacks against the United States,\" according to the bulletin, which expires January 18.\n\nWolf maintained in a statement that there is \"no specific, credible threat against the homeland.\"\n\nMourners chant 'Death to America' at funeral procession\n\nIn Iraq's capital on Saturday, thousands of people attended a funeral procession, mourning Soleimani and al-Muhandis as they chanted \"Death to America.\"\n\nMourners surround a car carrying Qasem Soleimani's coffin on Saturday in Baghdad.\n\nMourners wept as they walked alongside the vehicle carrying his coffin down the streets of Baghdad. Some carried signs that read, \"We are all Muhandis and Soleimani.\"\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi was among the crowd of mourners walking next to the cars carrying the coffins.\n\nSome women carrying flags of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces erupted into tears when the slain commanders were mentioned. Many mourners said the attack strengthened their resolve to expel US forces from Iraq.\n\n\"This strike killed our heroes, but it created a thousand more Hajji Soleimanis and Muhandises,\" said Assifa Abbas, 50, a mother of three PMF fighters. \"If Parliament doesn't vote to expel US troops, they will see the true face of the Iraqi street.\"\n\nAbbas walked in the procession with an image of al-Muhandis and Soleimani taped on her black chador. She said she would refuse to allow her sons back into her house until they pushed the \"last American\" from Iraq.\n\nFormer Parliament member Fawzi Akram, from Iraq's Turkmen ethnic minority, predicted the attack would end US dominance in the country. \"The map of a new Iraq will be drawn with the blood of these martyrs,\" Akram said.\n\nMourners wave flags Saturday in Baghdad.\n\nMourner Mohammad al-Fadli said the killings came as an \"indescribable shock.\" \"These are the people who got rid of ISIS for us,\" al-Fadli said.\n\nThe PMF -- Shia militia first mobilized in 2013 to confront the advance of ISIS -- were key ground forces in the early days of an offensive to push ISIS out Iraq, eventually recapturing several towns from the extremist group. Soleimani was reported to be on the ground directing battles against ISIS in Iraq, as well as Syria.\n\nIraq's anti-corruption demonstrators also aren't happy about the US strike\n\nIn another part of Baghdad, some anti-government demonstrators have been demanding, among other things, an end to heavy-handed Iranian influence in Iraq. But many haven't been happy about the US strike.\n\nSince the anti-corruption protests began in October, Iraqi security forces have tried to violently quash them, killing hundreds of demonstrators and wounding many more.\n\nStill, people at Baghdad's main protest site, Tahrir Square, said Saturday that the US should not have conducted an attack on their soil.\n\n\"We are the people of Iraq.

We did not take action to start a war.\" But the President's actions may soon catch up with his words at home -- especially when fighting an election campaign.\n\nAnd the President should be aware that while Iran may well start to settle the score quickly, it is also a master of serving revenge up cold.\n\nDuring a bout of Middle East tension in 1988, the USS Vincennes on patrol in the Persian Gulf accidentally shot down an Iranian civilian passenger jet, killing all 290 people on board.\n\nTehran's leaders waited nine months for revenge, widely suspected of having a pipe bomb detonated under the Vincennes captain's car, narrowly missing maiming his wife.\n\nThe advantage of attacking inside the US limits the likelihood of its regional neighbors escalating hostilities, and that's important for two reasons. One, Iran is likely to lose in a regional conflict and, two, the optics are better; revenge is directly aimed at the culprit of the attack, limiting tempers flaring in the region.\n\nFor sure the world has moved on a lot since 1988, and post-9/11 the US is far more attuned to catching international terrorists on its soil, but the idea for Iran will likely remain the same. Pick a soft and symbolic target that might embarrass the US President; a cyber-attack can now cause as much disruption as a pipe bomb, for example.\n\nKey players with much to lose\n\nOther stakeholders with sway in Tehran, like Russia and China, who last week held joint naval exercises in the Persian Gulf may also be ready to tolerate an Iranian response that helps remove Trump from the White House in 2020.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin might value Trump for his naivety and inexperience, but not his unpredictability, particularly where Russian interests can be negatively impacted like the Middle East. A big regional war would be inevitably costly for Russia; they simply couldn't walk away from the blood and toil they've spent in Syria. The calculation for Moscow would be, why risk war as a result of an unpredictable Trump in office if you can maintain and grow regional influence without undue economic pain?\n\nChina also is familiar with the economic pain and uncertainty inflicted by Trump: China and Russia -- both core allies of Iran -- both have much to lose if Tehran's revenge backfires, and potentially much to gain if the theocratic leadership can unseat Trump.\n\nOver the past few months Trump has oscillated from planning to pull forces from the region, to sending thousands more in. But this swing between, on the one hand, disengagement and, on the other, potentially triggering a war is an unsustainable uncertainty for both China and Russia. At a minimum they may well be ambivalent to Trump's exit from the White House and not stand in Iran's way.\n\nRussia in particular has much to gain from letting Iran take revenge as it sees fit. Putin is friends of the leaders in both Tehran and Riyadh. In any regional escalation Moscow could emerge as mediators, or at the very least have scope to exploit its role as middleman to America's disadvantage.\n\nAlthough Trump is unlikely to lose many votes over such subtle shifts of global power, it will still be grist to the mill for Democrats grinding down narrow margins next fall. So too will voter perceptions of what is happening in the Middle East be in play even if war is avoided, as still seems most likely thus far.\n\nTo that point, the killing of Soleimani may still be playing out.

We did not take action to start a war,\" Trump said in a statement from his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday, a day after a US drone strike on a Baghdad airport killed Qasem Soleimani.\n\nLater, while at a Miami church for an Evangelicals for Trump event, the President said: \"He was planning a very major attack and we got him.\"\n\nIran, in a letter to the United Nations, called the attack state terrorism and an unlawful criminal act.\n\nMajid Takht Ravanchi, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told CNN's \"Erin Burnett Out Front\" that the attack was \"tantamount to opening a war.\" There will be revenge, he said.\n\n\"The response for a military action is a military action.

The strike, condemned by Iran and its allies as an \"assassination,\" has been met with concern by European officials and the United Nations, who have called for de-escalation.\n\nThe Pentagon on Thursday confirmed the strike killed Soleimani , who as head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force became the architect of Tehran's proxy conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nAbu Mahdi al-Muhandis -- the deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) -- was also killed, according to a statement from the PMF, which said the pair \"were martyred by an American strike.\"\n\nAbu Mahdi al-Muhandis, left, and Qasem Soleimani were killed in the US strike.\n\nEarly Saturday, the group said another airstrike that targeted a convoy in the Taji area north of Baghdad killed and wounded a number of PMF members.\n\nThe initial report indicates a medical units convoy was hit near Taji Stadium in Baghdad, the PMF said.

He was also blamed for the December 31 US Embassy attack in Baghdad , and in addition to the hundreds killed in his time as a commander, thousands more were wounded, the Pentagon said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the State Department's special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said the strike was aimed at deterring impending attacks.\n\nThis vehicle was hit in the US airstrike Friday.\n\nPompeo told CNN that the strike had thwarted an \"imminent\" attack in the region, but declined to give any details on the intelligence on which he based his statement. Hook, who told Al Arabiya that he had seen \"all of the intelligence\" on the action, suggested that \"American personnel and facilities in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and beyond\" were the planned targets.\n\nAt least six people were killed in the strike, an Iraqi security source told CNN on condition of anonymity.\n\nAfter initial reports emerged, Trump shared a cryptic tweet that consisted only of an image of the US flag.

Gen. Ismail Qaani as Soleimani's replacement, according to a statement from his office published by IRNA.

He also called on Iraqis to exercise \"wisdom and shrewdness.\"\n\nOne pro-Iranian Iraqi cleric, Qais al-Khazali, called for the removal of US forces from Iraq and for the \"demise\" of Israel, as a response to the deaths of Soleimani and al-Muhandis.\n\nKhamenei pays a visit to Soleimani's family.\n\nThere are concerns, too, that the killing on Iraqi soil could have a destabilizing effect on that country and create space for a new proxy war, according to Feisal Istrabadi, the founding director of the Indiana University Center for the Study of the Middle East told CNN.\n\n\"This is a huge deal throughout the Middle East. The fact that it was done over the territory of Iraq means that Iraq will become what I feared it would become from the beginning: the battleground between Iran and the United States.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah, head of the Iran-backed Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah, has also vowed to avenge the killings, while Israel is assessing its security following the attacks, including at its diplomatic missions around the world.\n\nUS ally Saudi Arabia has called for restraint in the wake of the strike, which it said came as a result of \"terrorist acts\" that the kingdom had previously denounced.\n\nThe US State Department is urging its citizens to leave Iraq immediately. US embassies in Bahrain, Kuwait and Pakistan have issued security alerts to US government employees and citizens.\n\nThe force protection level for all US military in the Central Command area of operations has been increased in the last 24 hours, two US defense officials said Friday morning, and the US plans to deploy thousands of additional troops to the Middle East as tensions with Iran mount.\n\nBiden says US strike 'dynamite in a tinderbox'\n\nIn the US, the news of Soleimani's killing generated starkly different reactions along party lines, with Republicans heaping praise on Trump and Democrats expressing concerns about the timing, legality and consequences of the strike\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, warned that the US strike could trigger a conflict across the Middle East.\n\n\"President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, and he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel, our people and our interests, both here at home and abroad, and our partners throughout the region and beyond,\" Biden tweeted.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, emphasized that Soleimani \"was an enemy of the United States\" in a tweet, but asked: \"The question is this -- as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?\"\n\nSome key members of Congress -- such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is a member of the congressional Gang of Eight leaders, who are briefed on classified matters -- had not been made aware of the attack ahead of time. It's unclear how many other lawmakers had advance notice of the strike.\n\nSchumer said on the Senate floor Friday that the President \"does not have the authority for a war with Iran\" and that Trump would need congressional approval for a large increase in troops and \"and potential hostility over a longer time.\"\n\nRepublicans reacted with almost uniform praise for Trump.\n\n\"I appreciate President @realDonaldTrump's bold action against Iranian aggression,\" GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a fierce Trump ally, wrote in a tweet Thursday. \"To the Iranian government: if you want more, you will get more.\"\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a news release that \"General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans\" and \"the President made the brave and right call, and Americans should be proud of our service members who got the job done.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/02/middleeast/baghdad-airport-rockets/index.html", "published": "2020-01-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "US drone strike against top Iranian commander threatens spiral of violence in Middle East", "text": "(CNN) The killing of Qasem Soleimani , one of the most powerful men in Iran, is a dramatic escalation of an already dangerous situation in the Middle East, threatening to trigger violence from the Gulf to the shores of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Pentagon announced the US had carried out the attack near Baghdad airport, describing it as \"decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad.\"\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, the Pentagon asserted that \"General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\" It said Soleimani \"had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months.\"\n\nThe targeted US drone strike also killed one of the most prominent leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Al-Muhandis was the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group that Washington blames for a recent surge in rocket attacks against US forces in Iraq.\n\nHundreds of the group's supporters attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad this week following US airstrikes against five of Kataib Hezbollah's units in Iraq and Syria last Friday.\n\nThe latest crisis has been brewing for weeks amid an uptick in rocket attacks by Shia militia against Iraqi bases where US forces are present -- attacks of growing sophistication and accuracy -- in which a US civilian contractor has been killed.\n\nBut Charles Lister, a leading analyst of Iranian policy in the region, says this strike far eclipses the deaths of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in terms of strategic significance and implications. \"The US and Iran have been engaged in a dangerous tit-for-tat for months now, but this is a massive walk-up the escalation ladder,\" he said.\n\nThe US drone strike killed the commander of Iran's Quds Force at Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2019.\n\nBen Friedman, policy director of think tank Defense Priorities in Washington, told CNN that the strike was a \"remarkably reckless act, because the forces the US has in the region are not sufficient to deal with the potential fallout.\"\n\nSoleimani was once described by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as a \"living martyr of the revolution.\" Friedman describes his killing as an act of war that the Iranians will feel compelled to avenge.\n\nSoleimani was the architect of the growing Iranian military presence in Iraq, Syria and Yemen as the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force, essentially Iran's special forces tasked with missions beyond Iranian borders.\n\nHe had led the Quds force for nearly 20 years, \"working as a power broker and as a military force: assassinating rivals, arming allies, and, for most of a decade, directing a network of militant groups that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq,\" as Dexter Filkins wrote in a New Yorker profile in 2013. He was revered by his fighters, whose funerals he often attended.\n\nAli Soufan, a former FBI officer with extensive experience in the Middle East, wrote in the Combating Terrorism Center's Sentinel in 2018 that \"without question, Soleimani is the most powerful general in the Middle East today; he is also one of Iran's most popular living people.\"\n\n\"More than anyone else, Soleimani has been responsible for the creation of an arc of influence -- which Iran terms its 'Axis of Resistance' -- extending from the Gulf of Oman through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea,\" wrote Soufan, who now runs the Soufan Group, which analyzes events in the Middle East.\n\nIn early 2008, Soleimani sent General David Petraeus, then the most senior US commander in Iraq, an imperious message: \"Dear General Petraeus: You should be aware that I, Qassem Soleimani, control Iran's policy for Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Afghanistan. And indeed, the ambassador in Baghdad is a Quds Force member. The individual who's going to replace him is a Quds Force member.\"\n\nAbu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), left, and Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force unit, right, were killed in the US strike.\n\nSoleimani was hugely influential among what are known as the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq -- Shia militia first mobilized in 2013 to confront the advance of ISIS. He personally led their campaign to drive ISIS out of cities like Tikrit. Those militia remain a powerful force in Iraq, many of them outside the control of a weak state.\n\nSoleimani was also the chief Iranian official in providing support for the Assad regime in Syria, for which he was sanctioned by the US Treasury. Along with Russian airpower, his leadership of Shia militia from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon helped turn the tide of the war in Syria as Assad's army weakened in 2015-16.\n\nAnd Soleimani was an important Iranian interlocutor with the powerful Hezbollah militia in Lebanon. In a recent interview, Soleimani revealed that he had taken part in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, saying he was present in Lebanon throughout the conflict.\n\nTargets for retaliation\n\nThis strike then is nothing like those aimed at terrorist leaders like Baghdadi and bin Laden. US Democratic Senator Chris Murphy asked: \"Did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?\"\n\nThe assassination of such a powerful official will certainly not go unanswered by Tehran, which has responded to the imposition of crippling US sanctions over the last 18 months with what it calls a policy of maximum resistance. Khamenei himself said Friday that \"harsh revenge awaits the criminals\" involved in the killing of Soleimani and others, in a message to the nation published on his official website.\n\nIran's campaign has included the harassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf and Arabian Sea -- and attacks on Saudi Arabia, including devastating cruise missile strikes against the kingdom's largest oil processing plant at Abqaiq in September that took out 5.7 million barrels of oil production at a stroke.\n\nProtesters demonstrate in Tehran on Friday after the killing of Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force unit.\n\nBesides its own forces in the IRGC, Iran has powerful proxies across the region -- in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. All will likely be tasked with finding ways of attacking US interests and allies. In the face of adversaries with superior military capabilities, Iran has mastered the art of asymmetrical warfare, a sort of state-sponsored guerrilla action, and exported the model to its allies across the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javid Zarif described the US action as \"extremely dangerous & a foolish escalation. The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.\"\n\nWhat those consequences will be is yet unknown. One possible target for retaliation will be the small US military presence in Syria, which in some places is within miles of units of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units. Charles Lister believes \"the US presence in Syria now looks very vulnerable, having already shrunk in size and weakened in terms of credibility and partner trust.\"\n\n\"US allies in the Gulf, particularly Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi, could all fall victim to Iranian retaliatory measures, as could [the US] al-Udeid base in Qatar,\" adds Lister.\n\nFriedman says he doesn't think Iran \"will start a war with the United States, but you can imagine there will be a number of provocative acts against US forces.\" And he agrees the 500-strong US contingent in Syria might be especially vulnerable.\n\nFor the Iraqi government, already reeling in the face of popular protests against corruption that have left nearly 500 people dead over the past three months, this strike threatens to plunge the country into a new spasm of political violence.\n\nSince the Trump administration began its policy of \"maximum pressure\" against Iran, the Iraqis have tried to navigate a path to neutrality between two titans. They have largely failed -- and Iraq could now become the sandbox for a US-Iranian conflict, just as it faces the re-emergence of the remnants of ISIS in provinces north of Baghdad.\n\nIraqi authorities responded to the US strike by putting the Green Zone in Baghdad, where the US and other embassies are situated, on lockdown. But there is no underestimating the anger of a broad swathe of Iraqis against such a flagrant violation of the country's sovereignty.\n\nLister says Soleimani's death \"is a serious loss for Iran's regional agenda, but his 'martyrdom' will likely fuel a response that will, at least in the medium term, make up for his death. With Soleimani dead, war is coming -- that seems certain, the only questions are where, in what form and when?\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the country that has mastered asymmetrical warfare.

This law intends to ensure that those elected can serve the people according to the will of the people, not the will of the law clerks.\"\n\nCharges against Netanyahu were unveiled in November. He's maintained his innocence throughout the ongoing criminal proceedings, calling them an \"attempted coup\" led by the left and the media.\n\nPolitical rival slams request\n\nRival Benny Gantz, who leads the Blue and White party, blasted Netanyahu's request, saying voters will have two choices in the upcoming elections in March.\n\n\" ... the interests of Netanyahu will win or the national interest will win. Or there will be an extreme immunity government or there will be broad unity government. Or the kingdom of Netanyahu or the State of Israel,\" said Gantz shortly after Netanyahu spoke.\n\n\"Blue and White led by me will do everything according to the law.\"\n\nMembers of Knesset, including the Prime Minister, are entitled by law to request parliamentary immunity from prosecution. The request is considered by the Knesset's House Committee. If the request is approved in the committee, it is then passed on to a vote in the full 120-member Knesset.\n\nBut the House Committee hasn't been formed since Israel's election in April began a period of prolonged political deadlock. Elections in September failed to break that deadlock, and once again, no House Committee was formed. Without a seated committee, there is no way to consider Netanyahu's request for immunity, putting any criminal proceedings against the Prime Minister on hold at least until the upcoming elections on March 2.\n\nMembers of the opposition have said they would seek to form a temporary House Committee to consider the immunity request, but it's unclear at this stage if such a move is likely to happen.\n\nIf granted, the immunity from prosecution applies only to the current Knesset, meaning Netanyahu would have to request immunity again following any subsequent election.\n\nMoments after Netanyahu finished his statement, former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said his Yisrael Beiteinu would vote unanimously against immunity. \"It's now clear beyond any doubt. All that Netanyahu is interested in is immunity,\" said Liberman in a statement.\n\n\"This is what he wakes up with in the morning, this is what he lives, this is what he breathes throughout the day, this is what he goes to bed with. The State of Israel has become a hostage of a private personal problem of Netanyahu.\"\n\nFour reasons for seeking immunity\n\nIf the immunity request is rejected, Netanyahu does not have to resign immediately. Under Israeli law, he can remain Prime Minister while the trial is ongoing. He only has to resign if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process, a process which could take years.\n\nUnder Israeli law, Knesset members can request immunity citing one of four reasons:\n\nProtection of freedom of expression\n\nProsecutors were acting in bad faith or discriminating against the member\n\nThe Knesset has already disciplined the member and there is no public interest in a trial\n\nCriminal proceedings would cause serious damage to the functioning of the Knesset, its committees, or the will of the voters. In addition, there would not be considerable damage to the public interest without a trial.\n\nSince the immunity law was updated in 2005, no member of Knesset has been granted immunity from prosecution. (There is one open request for former Minister of Welfare Haim Katz, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, who faces indictment on charges of fraud and breach of trust.) Prior to 2005, parliamentary immunity was automatically granted to members of Knesset -- the law was changed to force them to submit a formal request, which would then be weighed by the Knesset House Committee.\n\nIn recent weeks, Netanyahu had begun floating the idea of seeking immunity at campaign rallies, warming his voter base to the possibility. On Sunday, at an event in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said, \"Immunity is not against democracy. Immunity is a cornerstone of democracy.\" The crowd erupted into cheers, with some shouting, \"Take the immunity!\"\n\nLengthy investigation\n\nSince the investigations were announced three years ago, Netanyahu has waged a campaign of delegitimization against them, denouncing them as a media-driven witch hunt. As the investigations advanced, Netanyahu sharpened his rhetoric and expanded his attacks, saying, \"Every day, my blood, my wife's blood, my children's blood is being shed by those with evil intent.\" Calling the investigations \"contaminated\" and demanding that \"the investigators are investigated,\" Netanyahu began attacking the judicial system, the police, and the state prosecutor's office.\n\n\"There is one law for others, and one law for Netanyahu,\" he claimed in November when the indictments were unveiled.\n\nAs speculation grew earlier this week that Netanyahu would request immunity, Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List, tweeted Saturday, \"I call on the entire public to seek immunity against the flu, not against an indictment of bribery.\"\n\nThe decision to allow the formation of a Knesset House Committee now passes to Speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party. If Edelstein decides not to allow the committee to form, the legal proceedings against Netanyahu could remain stuck until after the March elections. Israel's legal deadlock would match its political deadlock.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/01/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-immunity-request/index.html", "published": "2020-01-01T00:00:00"},

public remarks since the former auto executive fled for Lebanon a week ago.\n\nGhosn left Japan \"illegally by unjust methods,\" said Justice Minister Masako Mori, the country's top judicial official. She said that authorities have no official record of Ghosn's departure from Japan, and that prosecutors are investigating the case.\n\nMori also said she has ordered the country's immigration department to \"further tighten\" rules for leaving the country \"so that the same situation won't be repeated.\"\n\nMori's statement \u2014 along with a similar one published Sunday by a Tokyo prosecutor \u2014 marked the first time Japanese authorities addressed Ghosn's stunning escape last week.

He also announced that \"the world will witness a new strategic weapon\" in the near future, KCNA reported.\n\nLater Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters he was still optimistic about the future of diplomacy -- despite Kim's new rhetoric. Touting his relationship with Kim, Trump said he believed the North Korean leader was a \"man of his word.\"\n\n\"He likes me, I like him, we get along,\" he said. \"He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News earlier Tuesday that he hoped Kim \"doesn't go in that direction\" and instead will \"choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.\"\n\nThe US is \"hopeful\" that Kim \"will make the right decision,\" he said, also telling CBS Evening News that \"if Chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to President Trump, that is deeply disappointing.\"\n\n\"We've lived up to our commitments, we continue to hold out hope that he'll live up to his as well,\" Pompeo said.\n\nKim was expected to give his annual New Year's speech on Wednesday -- a highly anticipated address as he had said he would only give the United States until the end of 2019 to change its negotiating strategy.\n\nBut at the time of reporting, the speech had not gone ahead. Kim had given a New Year's speech ever year since 2013, and traditionally used the address to make major announcements, update his people on a handful of government policies, and chart a direction for the country in the coming months.\n\nA 'Christmas gift' to the US\n\nThe specific language -- North Korea referred to its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch in 2017 as a \"gift\" -- sparked speculation that Pyongyang could do something equally provocative , though the holiday came and went without any weapons test.\n\nA source familiar with the North Korean leadership's current mindset told CNN ahead of Christmas that the \"gift\" was more likely to be a new, hardline policy in which Kim would reinforce the state ideology of self-reliance as a means of improving the economy -- a pledge Kim made to his people in 2018 -- rather than pursuing sanctions relief in exchange for denuclearization.\n\nTrump said on Christmas Eve that the US would be ready to handle the \"gift,\" whatever it was. On Tuesday night, he again downplayed the prospect of a \"Christmas gift\" the North has threatened. \"I hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase,\" he joked.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet Wednesday that the US should \"resume all canceled or down-sized military exercises in South Korea\" in response to Kim's threat. Bolton also called on Congress to hold hearings \"on whether US troops are truly ready\" to respond to any kind of attack.\n\nOn Sunday, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the US is prepared to take action if the so-called gift is delivered, including a potential long-range missile test. Pompeo said Monday that the US is watching Pyongyang \"very closely\" in light of the \"Christmas gift\" threat.\n\nThe country had promised the gift if the US doesn't provide concessions like sanctions relief by its self-imposed, year-end deadline. The Trump administration had widely interpreted the promise of a \"Christmas gift\" to mean a weapons test, especially as intelligence indicators grew. Though no such tests have been detected from North Korea since Christmas, officials have remained watchful in the days following the holiday.\n\nThe KCNA report Tuesday said that Kim \"solemnly declared that there is no need to hesitate with any expectation of the US lift of sanctions even now that we had close look into the real intention of the US.\"\n\nThe leader also said North Korea \"will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US,\" the state news agency reported.\n\nThis, Kim said, will guarantee \"our long-term security, noting that the scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated depending on the (US') future attitude (toward) the DPRK.\"\n\nPolitical ramifications for Trump\n\nKim's harder line could have political ramifications for Trump and his reelection campaign. Trump and his administration have sold the talks as an important foreign policy win, but Kim's new policy could spell a return to the tense days of 2017 when the two leaders traded insults and threats of nuclear war.\n\nThe two sides already started employing some of that rhetoric last month in the lead-up to the deadline. Trump revived his \"Rocket Man\" moniker for Kim, and North Korean state media referred to the US President as a \"dotard\" -- an archaic insult for a senile old person that Pyongyang first used to insult Trump after his address at the UN General Assembly in 2017.\n\nWhile North Korea may be publicly blaming the Trump administration for the stalled talks, political calculations are also likely at play.\n\nThe source familiar with the North Korean leadership's current mindset said Pyongyang views Trump as politically vulnerable due to his impeachment and the looming 2020 presidential election.\n\nJoseph Yun, the former US special representative for North Korea policy, weighed in on the matter on Wednesday, telling CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"Newsroom\" that \"Kim is definitely, definitely playing Trump.\"\n\n\"No, (Kim) has not signed a deal for denuclearization,\" he said. \"And, in fact, if you ask most experts in and out of the government, they would agree there is no denuclearization within short-term horizon.\"\n\nAnalysts believe Pyongyang is worried that if it does cut a deal with Trump and he loses in November, his successor may not uphold the accord. North Korea and the United States have reached previous agreements that did not survive successive administrations.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/31/politics/north-korea-kim-jong-un-us-policy-denuclearization/index.html", "published": "2019-12-31T00:00:00"}, {"title": "2019 in Review Fast Facts", "text": "(CNN) Here is a look back at the events of 2019.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJamel Ahmed Mohammed Ali Al-Badawi, the terrorist behind the 2000 attack on the USS Cole , is killed during an airstrike in Yemen according to a statement from US Central Command.\n\nJanuary 14 - About About 30,000 Los Angeles educators go on strike , affecting more than half a million students.\n\nJanuary 28 - Author Marianne Williamson launches her Author Marianne Williamson launches her Democratic presidential campaign\n\nFebruary 14 - The Senate The Senate confirms (54-45) William Barr as attorney general .

Hwang is now leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party.\n\nA total of 23 lawmakers from Hwang's party and three of their aides were charged, along with five lawmakers and five aides from the ruling Democratic Party of Korea.\n\nThe charges relate to a mass brawl in April last year, when lawmaker Chae Yi-bai and four of his aides were trapped in his office after Liberty Korea Party members blocked his door with a sofa.

But China is not the Soviet Union", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) In the battle for global dominance, all eyes are on China and the United States.\n\nWith a new decade of competition looming, Washington is pushing back hard against Beijing across a range of fronts, including trade, military and diplomatic matters.\n\nFor some the tensions are reminiscent of the Cold War, the almost 50-year conflict between the Soviet Union and the US which defined much of the 20th century.\n\nBut this is not the Cold War -- and the People's Republic of China is not the USSR.\n\nAn economic juggernaut\n\nThree decades after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, China is now richer and more stable than its powerful communist predecessor ever was -- giving it enormous global sway.\n\nIn fact, China's economy is expected to overtake the US by most economic measures by 2030, according to Herve Lemahieu, director of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute Asian Power and Diplomacy Program.\n\nA lot of this success is down to a reinterpretation of traditional ideology. Since the death of founder Mao Zedong in 1976, the ruling Communist Party has slowly moved to embrace aspects of capitalism, in an ideological construct known locally as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"\n\nRather than ending up an anachronism of an outdated communist system, China's planned economy has been used to dramatically bolster state-owned enterprises, now some of the largest companies in the world.\n\n\"The Soviet Union focused on their military and the economy was almost an afterthought. The Soviet economy was almost entirely focused on their military,\" said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations with the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, who worked as a Soviet military expert for the US Navy during the Cold War.\n\nChina has tried to avoid falling into a trap of rapid, unsustainable military growth. While it has still steadily grown and modernized its military, the country has managed to keep its spending far below the exorbitant levels of the Soviet Union, at least publicly.\n\nAs a result, China is far more economically powerful in 2019 than the Soviet Union ever was. \"During the Cold War in the 1980s, the Soviet Union had a smaller economy than Japan,\" Lemahieu said.\n\nJUST WATCHED China launches world's largest 5G network Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China launches world's largest 5G network 02:13\n\nMilitary tensions\n\nThe Soviet Union was a bold, expansive military power, and by the 1980s it had tens of thousands of military personnel and weapons posted \"in every major region of the world,\" according to US government reports\n\nBy comparison, China has appeared to show little interest in expanding far outside Asia. While it has dramatically expanded its economic and diplomatic reach in recent years, the country's military has opened just one international base -- in Djibouti, on the northeastern tip of Africa.\n\nThat isn't to say that Washington and Beijing don't engage in military brinksmanship. It's just far more localized to Asia.\n\nBoth sides have accused the other of provoking a military confrontation in the South China Sea through a rapid militarization of the region. When the US deployed a THAAD missile defense system in South Korea in 2017, relations between Seoul and Beijing went into a deep freeze.\n\nWhile the threat of nuclear war also hung over the world during the Cold War, the situation with China is markedly different.\n\nBut there have been early signs that tensions over nuclear issues could grow again.\n\nIn early August, the US officially withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia which had limited the development of ground-based nuclear missiles. The US wanted Russia and China to join them in working out a new treaty -- but Beijing said no.\n\n\"If the US deploys missiles in this part of the world, at the doorstep of China, China will be forced to take countermeasures,\" said Fu Cong, Director General of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, on August 6.\n\nJUST WATCHED Chinese parade marks 70 years since end of WWII Replay More Videos ...

China is the largest trading partner for dozens of countries across the world, including major US allies like Australia, Japan and New Zealand.\n\n\"You might be an ally of the US in a security sense and consider China to be your most important trading partner. There are no clear blocs anymore, that's not how this will work,\" Lemahieu said.\n\nEven at home, there are many more trade links between the US and China today than there were between Washington and Moscow. US President Donald Trump has long complained about the trade deficit with China, accusing Beijing of creating an unfair advantage for its own companies. In response, he kicked off a trade war in June 2018, placing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods from China.\n\nBut with the US and China exposed to each others' fiscal setbacks, further economic competition won't be a simple win-or-lose proposition, as with the Soviet Union.\n\n\"During the Cold War we weren't dealing with an interdependent global economy but essentially two major blocs that were more or less self-dependent in terms of their economic well-being,\" Lemahieu said.\n\nAny prolonged economic conflict could be a zero-sum game for both the US and China, Lemahieu said, dragging down both economies and causing repercussions across the world.\n\n\"You might be able to hit China to such an extent that by 2030 its economy is 8% smaller, but then the US would also take a hit. It could be about 3.3% smaller,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd say the economics and the scale favors China rather than the US.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump, China agree on 'phase one' trade deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump, China agree on 'phase one' trade deal 01:10\n\nUS allies divided\n\nWhile the US could argue the Soviet Union was a clear threat to world security, the case against Beijing is far less simple. In fact, some countries are finding China's offers of financial support with no political interference an attractive option.\n\n\"China has played the card that the US tried to mold the world in their image, while (Beijing) are just wanting to trade. Your government and your country is your own sovereign question and we have no say,\" Schuster said. \"That's very compelling.\"\n\nBalancing political and economic considerations has already led to divisions between the US and its previously close Cold War allies. In 2018, for example, former CIA analyst Peter Mattis gave testimony at a US congressional committee which suggested New Zealand's role in the well-established global Five Eyes alliance should be reviewed.\n\nComprising the US, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the intelligence gathering network traces its origins to World War II and remains a powerful diplomatic bloc. However China is now the largest trading partner for two out of the five members -- Australia and New Zealand -- and a major part of the economy for the other three.\n\nIn his 2018 testimony, Mattis said relations between the US and its partners had grown more complicated since the Cold War, when there were two very distinct global spheres -- one communist, one capitalist.\n\n\"(Now) everyone has some sort of connectivity. The US has an important role in Europe as a partner, China has an important role in Europe as a partner,\" he told CNN. \"Beijing is present in all these areas that the Soviet Union wasn't.\"\n\nThe US has certainly been ramping up the rhetoric of late. Washington this year lobbied hard to stop countries from using technology from Chinese giant Huawei to build 5G networks over alleged security concerns.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying that there is \"no proof\" the Chinese government has any influence over it.\n\nAustralia was the first to ban Huawei from its 5G network. New Zealand has enacted a partial ban, while the UK is still deliberating.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has even threatened to stop other US partners from receiving sensitive intelligence if they didn't comply. \"It makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them,\" Pompeo said in February.\n\nDespite the partial ban, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Chinese state-run media CGTN in April that the company was still welcome in her country.\n\n\"We already have Huawei products in New Zealand and Huawei already operates in New Zealand,\" she said.\n\nSchuster, formerly of the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said such public divisions among Washington's close allies didn't bode well for any ambition to build a united global front against China.\n\n\"If the US can't convince the Five Eyes, the odds of successfully persuading any others not immediately and directly threatened by China will be quite small,\" he added.\n\nJUST WATCHED Huawei launches operating system as a hedge in trade war Replay More Videos ...

They were Chinese.\n\nFifty years after the US beat the Soviet Union to the moon, the space race is on again. Only this time it's the US and China aiming to be the next country to successfully land a person on the moon.\n\nThe new lunar race is symbolic of so much in the new state of relations between the two countries. China has caught up to the US quickly -- when US astronauts landed on the moon in 1969, China's space agency hadn't even launched a satellite -- and is now hoping to overtake it.\n\nBut even in space, the relationship is a lot more complicated than the hyper-competitive attitude of the 1960s. In fact, NASA cooperated with China's National Space Administration to monitor the Chang'e probe when it landed on the far side of the moon in January.\n\nSpeaking to the state-run China Daily in January, former NASA chief Charles Bolden said he was hopeful US government restrictions on working with China would be lifted, allowing for more space cooperation. \"We look at (the Chang'e probe landing) as an achievement for humanity,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED China is setting the stage for next space race Replay More Videos ...

To be closer to his family, he would view his father's grave on Google Earth.\n\n\"I know exactly where his tomb is,\" Elkun told CNN in his north London home. \"When I was a kid we would go there, pray at the mosque, visit our relatives. The entire community was connected to that graveyard.\"\n\nHe \"visited\" his father like this for nearly two years. But in June, something changed. The satellite photo on Google had been updated and the graveyard that used to be there was now nothing more than a flattened, empty field.\n\n\"I had no idea what happened,\" said Elkun. \"I was completely in shock.\"\n\nCemeteries destroyed\n\nElkun's story is not unique.\n\nChina appears to have been destroying traditional Uyghur cemeteries for several years as part of what critics describe as a broader, coordinated campaign to control Islamic beliefs and Muslim minority groups within its borders.\n\nIn a months' long investigation, working with sources in the Uyghur community and analyzing hundreds of satellite images, CNN has found more than 100 cemeteries that have been destroyed, most in just the last two years. This reporting was backed up by dozens of official Chinese government notices announcing the \"relocation\" of cemeteries.\n\nThe destruction of Uyghur cemeteries was first reported in October by French news agency AFP and satellite imagery analysts Earthrise Alliance. They found at least 45 cemeteries had been destroyed since 2014.\n\nAFP reporters visited several sites of destroyed cemeteries. In some, they found several bones that scientists later confirmed from photos were human remains\n\nCNN has identified more than 60 other gravesites that are no longer there, by cross-checking sites known to the Uyghur community abroad with satellite images taken over a number of years.\n\nIn response to CNN's request for comment, the Chinese government didn't deny the cemetery destruction.\n\nA spokesperson with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement in part, \"Governments...in Xinjiang fully respect and guarantee the freedom of all ethnic groups... to choose cemeteries, and funeral and burial methods.\"\n\nOne official notice announcing the \"relocation\" of a cemetery in western Aksu City said it needed to be moved \"to meet the demand of city planning and promote construction.\"\n\nCNN shared before and after images with five experts from Canada, the United States and Australia with experience in Uyghur culture or satellite imagery. They included Rian Thum, a respected historian who uses satellite imagery as part of his research into Islam in China.\n\nThum confirmed the majority of the satellite images shared with him were undoubtedly destroyed cemeteries. The other four experts verified the rest of the sites.\n\n\"It is a phenomenon that stretches right across the region of Xinjiang,\" said Thum.\n\nAt a press conference on December 16, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that citizens' freedom of religious belief is strongly protected in Xinjiang and that local people endorsed the Chinese government's measures to \"fight terrorism and maintain stability.\"\n\nHuman rights crisis\n\nChina is under intense and unwelcome international scrutiny after the release of documents that appear to confirm that it is deliberately trying to alter the Uyghur people to be more like the wider mandarin-speaking Han Chinese population.\n\nThe US State Department has said up to two million people from Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, have been held in a massive network of detention camps since 2017.\n\nChina's government has consistently denied it is committing human rights abuses.

The chanting crowds reflected uproar seen in 2012, after the notorious gang-rape and murder of a student in the capital, New Delhi.\n\nBut cultural values held behind the closed doors of family homes are a part of the problem that is being protested against: privilege for boys and submissiveness for girls.\n\n\"Girls are trained not to exist,\" says Deepa Narayan , an author and independent adviser on international poverty, gender and development. \"You (girls) don't need any power. And if you want power there's something wrong with you and you're being bad.\"\n\n'Patriarchy pretends men are kings'\n\nIndia's preference for boys is prevalent even before birth. Sex-selective abortion in the country has distorted the natural sex ratio, in favor of males, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nit can lead to Some experts say the practice is becoming less common but for girls,it can lead to poorer allocation of household resources and medical care, neglect, and even infanticide.\n\n\"In some families, during a girl's birth, the welcome is more muted. But a boy's birth is welcomed to a drum; buying expensive sweets and telling everyone that a boy is born, a boy is born,\" says Narayan, who has more than 25 years of experience working at the World Bank, the United Nations and NGOs.\n\nBut this is not a result of \"evil\" parenting, she tells CNN. \"This is all done under the rubric of love. It's not conscious. In India, they call it adjusting (to the culture).\"\n\nHowever, this type of conditioning can have detrimental effects. \"Boys are not taught dialogue. Their needs are just met, they're never told 'no.' They're told not to cry. Where does all that anger and rage go? Women go into depression and men lash out.\"\n\nNarayan argues that the mental health of Indian women \"is a totally neglected area.\"\n\nIn fact, 36.6% of global suicide deaths among women occur in India. Furthermore, Indian women who took their lives were more likely to be married, to be from more developed states, and aged below 35.\n\nBut a male dominated society is bad for men too. \"Patriarchy lifts them, pretends that they are kings. But no human being can lift up to such high expectations,\" says Narayan. \"That's why it's so difficult for men to apologize because they are expected to be always right, godlike figures and providers.\n\n\"Nobody is happy, but we're not breaking this apart. Things would change much faster if we actively engaged men in conversation.\"\n\n'Rapists put their mothers on pedestals'\n\nA woman who interviewed 61 convicted rapists detained in India's largest prison agrees.\n\nDr Madhumita Pandey, originally from India and now a Criminology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, was only 22 years old when she carried out her doctoral research at Tihar Jail in Delhi. The men convicted of the infamous 2012 gang rape are held in the same complex.\n\nThese conversations are \"missing\" from discussions on sexual violence against women, Pandey tells CNN.\n\n\"A lot of them actually found the conversation (with me) very cathartic,\" she says. \"How can you reflect on your actions if you're not even going to speak about it?\"\n\nThe attackers, interviewed between 2013 and 2017, seemed like any other men, Pandey says. They also shared views that reflected Indian society's perception of the gender division of labor, with women \"in charge of raising the family and taking care of household chores\" and men as \"outdoor agents.\"\n\nThis especially came to light in their relationships with their mothers and sisters.\n\n\"Of all the men that I spoke to, there were only a handful that didn't share a good relationship with their mothers. Everyone else put the mother on this pedestal.\"\n\nPandey says this is due to the absence of fathers for some of the men while they were growing up, and the idea that they were the preferred child.\n\n'India needs sex education'\n\nMany of the culprits had older sisters. However, the men felt they were the favorite child because their mothers were elated to have finally conceived a boy, leading to unearned privileges such as being fed first. \"Mothers were playing a very crucial role in setting gender role standards,\" says Pandey.\n\nThe rapists didn't express remorse and described themselves as \"inmates\" instead of offenders, often blaming their victims, Pandey says. She puts this down to a lack of understanding of their actions. Pandey advocates for restorative justice, delivered to convicted attackers during their lengthy jail terms, so they may emerge as reformed individuals.\n\nAlthough the men she interviewed were generally uneducated and from low socio-economic backgrounds, she stresses that this status does not correlate with violent behavior against women and that people from privileged backgrounds may have the wealth and means to evade justice.\n\nPandey argues that prevention can happen in schools. \"We need educational institutions to introduce some form of comprehensive sexuality education. It's crucial that there's more awareness regarding sexual violence. We need to be telling people about active consent, about toxic masculinity and the younger we get to people, the better it is.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back 02:03\n\n'And then another rape happens'\n\nZero-tolerance towards everyday misogynism is also key, Pandey says. \"There's so much outrage when there is a rape case. Where is the outrage when day-to-day experiences of women are also highlighting abuse in some shape or form?\" These behaviors, she says, lead to more extreme crimes.\n\nThe crimes also happen in the home. Shockingly, 93.1% of rape offenders were neighbors, relatives or prospective marital partners of the victim, according to National Crime Records Bureau data from 2017 . And marital rape is not criminalized in the country.\n\nBut mass outrage is expressed in India for attacks outside of the home, not within it.\n\n\"People don't make the link between someone else's terrible, extreme behavior and their own everyday behavior in the home, the offices and the streets. I think that's the missing link,\" says Narayan.\n\nThe death penalty that is often demanded in rallies also doesn't kill the problem.\n\n\"The men will get hanged, people will feel that the government has done their duty, and you're going to go back to sleep. And then another rape happens,\" says Pandey.\n\n'Crack the shame around rape'\n\nCollective outrage can spur change, Narayan says.\n\n\"Protests are an opportunity to start talking about sexual violence. Before the (2012 Delhi gang rape), even the word rape, you couldn't really use it. It's beginning to crack the shame around rape,\" she says.\n\n\"It's really a people's movement ... getting out to the streets without guns, without anything, embarking in protest, is a very courageous act.\"\n\nThe demands are getting through to some leaders. Most recently, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that his government would make schoolboys sign pledges to not commit crimes against girls or women. Mothers and sisters are also encouraged to engage in discussions with boys and warn them against wrongdoing. Narayan highlights this as an important step.\n\nThe need to engage boys is being implemented by some organizations in the country, such as the Equal Community Foundation, based in the western city of Pune. \"Women's empowerment initiatives will continue to yield lower results due to the backlash that they face from the men and boys in their families who continue to be socialized into patriarchal norms,\" ECF's executive director Christina Furtado tells CNN.\n\nThe NGO overcame the reluctance to fund male-focused initiatives by relaying the long-term benefits of working with boys.\n\nIn the meantime, however, India still ranks 125 out of 162 countries on the UN's Gender Inequality Index.\n\nPeople flooding the streets to express a chorus of disapproval for abuse against women is a powerful display that can be difficult to ignore. But once the streets clear and everyone retreats behind closed doors, the message must be firmly driven home.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/27/asia/india-rape-education-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2019-12-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Opioid crisis: Synthetic opioids ravaged the US during the last decade. They may do even more damage to Asia", "text": "\"Aroon\" and \"Somchai\" are pseudonyms used to protect the privacy of two heroin users.\n\nHong Kong (CNN) Aroon's eyes rolled back into his head, his breath became fast and labored, and his body started to quiver.\n\nIt was a drug overdose.\n\nAroon had just injected what he thought was heroin with his friend Somchai, who recounted the ordeal to CNN.\n\nSomchai said he took a larger hit but assumes his years of regular heroin use had given him a higher tolerance than Aroon. Somchai and Aroon are not their real names. CNN is using pseudonyms to protect their privacy.\n\nAroon was one of three people who overdosed from the same batch of drugs at the same harm reduction meeting in the Thai capital in September, said Pascal Tanguay, a Bangkok-based expert in drug issues and policy. All three survived.\n\nTanguay suspected the trio could have unwittingly taken fentanyl, the powerful synthetic opioid that has ravaged the United States in recent years.\n\nSo, he convinced one user to give him a small sample and tested the drug using strips he obtained from a US-based NGO. The results confirmed what experts have long feared -- that fentanyl, the synthetic drug produced in vast quantities in mainland China, was being mixed with heroin in Thailand.\n\n\"This is the first indication we've had confirming that it's in heroin supply in Bangkok,\" said Jeremy Douglas, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's top official in Southeast Asia.\n\n\"The United States was ready compared to Asia. This region is not ready.\" Jeremy Douglas, United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime\n\nDouglas called Tanguay's finding a \"canary in the coal mine.\" Fentanyl had shown in up the heroin supply in the closest major city to southern China and the Golden Triangle, the border region where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet that has long been notorious for drug production and vice.\n\nExperts say the overdoses should alarm local authorities given how deadly the synthetic opioid crisis has been in the United States in recent years.\n\nAn illicit fentanyl crisis on the same scale as the US would be \"brutal\" in Asia, Douglas said, due to a lack of public awareness campaigns, treatment facilities and a widespread ingrained perception that drug users are criminals.\n\n\"The United States was ready compared to Asia -- this region is not ready,\" he said.\n\nThe Thai Office of Narcotics Control Board did not respond to an email seeking comment for this story.\n\nThis bag of drugs was thought to be heroin. Tanguay said it tested positive for fentanyl.\n\nA new version of an old problem\n\nThough fentanyl may be relatively new compared to heroin, both are opioids: a class of drugs with a long, dark history in Asia.\n\nNatural opiates sourced from poppy plants, like opium, have been consumed on the continent for centuries -- both as a painkiller and smoked as a recreational drug.\n\nThe British empire made a vast fortune by sending opium from its Indian colony to customers throughout Asia. Rulers in China and Southeast Asia unsuccessfully fought to eradicate the opium trade, unable to counter the incredible economic and military might of the British empire and its trading arm, the British East India Company.\n\nMost notably, the emperor of the Qing dynasty in China attempted to make opium trade and cultivation illegal. In response, Britain went to war to keep its largest opium market and won, a loss the Chinese still consider a humiliation today. And for much of the 20th Century, the majority of the world's opium and heroin came from the Golden Triangle.\n\n\"Southeast Asia and China have had a longstanding history of opium abuse,\" said Bryce Pardo, a researcher at the RAND Corporation who focuses on drug policy. \"It is entirely possible that you could see a return to those long-running, entrenched drug-use patterns, just with new chemicals.\"\n\nSynthetic opioids like fentanyl are made to mimic the chemical structure of poppy-based drugs. Both bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.\n\nAs the brain becomes used to the feelings, it takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to depetndence and, later, addiction.\n\nSynthetics opioids are much more potent than plant-based ones. And because synthesizing drugs is cheaper and more reliable than farming plants, they can be produced at a fraction of the cost. That's part of the reason US pharmaceutical companies marketed prescription opioids aggressively ahead of the crisis in North America, experts said.\n\nPardo said the opioid crisis in the US was unique because not many other countries \"allow private interests so much power in terms of designing policies,\" from the way corporations were permitted to market the drugs directly to consumers and lobby the government to assess hospitals on pain relief.\n\n\"The (pharmaceutical) industry oversold the benefits and really tried to hide the costs associated with prescription pain medications. And that's particular to the United States,\" Pardo said.\n\n\"We just overdid it when it came to treating pain in this country.\"\n\nPardo and other experts say that Asia is believed to have millions of heroin users just based on the massive number of people that live in China, India and Southeast Asia.\n\nBut precise numbers are hard to come by due to a lack of research in the region and the stigma associated with drug use.\n\n\"Probably the largest share of drug users in the world is in Asia, we just don't know it because they're not doing the regular surveys (on drug use),\" Pardo said. \"A third of the world's population lives in this region. So it could be very well they have the largest share of drug users, including heroin users.\"\n\nThough Pardo and Dogulas both said that Tanguay's finding suggested at least some fentanyl has been mixed into the heroin supply in Bangkok, the experts who spoke to CNN agreed that it is incredibly difficult to paint an accurate picture of the regional situation.\n\nThere just isn't enough data to determine if a synthetic opioid crisis is imminent or is already here.\n\nBut that doesn't mean analysts are not concerned.\n\n\"Fentanyl mimics heroin. It's far more profitable then heroin, so it's a matter of time before it gets pushed into the heroin market,\" said Douglas of the UNODC. \"We've seen what the impacts can be. You don't cut it right, you have (an) overdose. And this region is not ready for an overdose epidemic.\"\n\nSupplying an existing market\n\nDouglas said if drug dealers were to switch to fentanyl, they wouldn't have to grow a new market -- they'd just replace heroin, the already existing product, with something more powerful, cheaper to make and already produced nearby in China. It's \"more the model of Uber taking over a taxi fleet,\" Douglas said.\n\nThat's essentially what happened to one of the older group of heroin addicts affected by the opioid crisis in the United States, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at Brandeis University's Institute for Behavioral Health and the co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative.\n\nThese weren't people who became addicted to prescription pills. They are a group of mostly men who were still using after surviving the heroin epidemic of the 1970s and the AIDS crisis after, Kolodny said.\n\n\"These men managed to beat the odds for the past 40 or 50 years with their heroin addiction. Once illicit fentanyl emerged (in the heroin supply), deaths in this group began to skyrocket\" because so many users were unwittingly overdosing, Kolodny explained.\n\nKolodny and the other experts interviewed by CNN worry Asia's heroin users could start dying at similar rates if synthetic opioids go mainstream.\n\nJUST WATCHED Test strip helps prevent fentanyl overdoses Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Test strip helps prevent fentanyl overdoses 01:50\n\nBranching out from meth\n\nA synthetic opioid crisis in Asia could be particularly devastating because the region is already dealing with what is believed to be the world's biggest methamphetamine problem.\n\nDrug dealers in the region have invested in meth and other lab-made drugs in recent years because synthetic drugs are far cheaper to make than ones that require farming. They are less reliant on climate and labs are much easier to hide than fields of poppies.\n\nToday, the region is awash with meth because drug dealers have sold it at extremely low prices to create a huge customer base. The UNODC said earlier this year the Asia-Pacific trade meth trade is now worth between $30 billion and $61 billion annually.\n\nAnd Asian syndicates have since become so incredibly profitable that they can write off multimillion dollar busts as the cost of doing business\n\nAnalysts are concerned that drug dealers will diversify their portfolios and start pumping out synthetic opioids in addition to the host of illicit substances they are already manufacturing. Douglas' UNODC reported earlier this year that it appears drug manufacturers have started making both meth and and ketamine, a horse tranquilizer-turned party drug.\n\nBut a lot of questions about the rise of fentanyl -- and Aroon's overdose -- remain unanswered.\n\nThough Aroon's incident may be the first official confirmation of illicit synthetic opioids in the Bangkok heroin market, Somchai believes fentanyl has been around for at least a few months, because the stuff he has been injecting over that time period has been so strong.\n\nHe also said he's seen more people overdose in recent months, some of whom have died.\n\nBut Somchai's story is only that, a story -- it does not highlight any statistical trend as far as the prevalence of synthetic opioids in Southeast Asia. Drug analysts in the region are often forced to rely on such anecdotal evidence and hearsay, because they lack the proper data points to draw conclusions.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that the concerns are real, especially as the region is already struggling to cope with the tremendous increase in methamphetamine use and abuse.\n\n\"Sadly, governments in the region don't really care about those on the edge of society like drug users,\" said Douglas. \"They continue to arrest them, they generally treat them like criminals not medical patients. And that's fundamentally part of the problem too.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/29/asia/asia-synthetic-drugs-2020-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2019-12-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "New Zealand man stabs endangered sea lion in bid to protect partner", "text": "(CNN) A New Zealand man who speared an endangered sea lion says he did it to protect his partner, adding: \"It needed a stab.

Yet, closer inspection reveals that the building is formed from two separate towers joined by a four-story atrium at its base and a footbridge connecting the upper floors.\n\nThe structure will house a boutique hotel -- with interiors also designed by Hadid -- as well as office space and restaurants.

The depot was 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) from the blast hypocenter.\n\nMore than 90% of the structures in Hiroshima were either destroyed or damaged by the blast and fire, according to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Images taken from the air in the aftermath of the bombing show the totality of the destruction, with only a handful of steel and concrete buildings left standing.\n\nA photo taken on June 26, 1946 show the ruins of Hiroshima nearly a year after the US military dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city.

The first three units, each almost 5,600 square meters large, are owned by the Hiroshima government. The fourth is slightly smaller at 5,000 square meters and is owned by the national government, according to the Hiroshima Peace Media Center. None have been occupied since 1997.\n\nHowever, the site's future is now uncertain. The Hiroshima government has proposed demolishing two buildings for public safety reasons, after a recent survey revealed they may be at risk of collapse during major earthquakes.\n\nThe study , conducted by local authorities in 2017, found the depot \"had a high risk of collapse\" in the event of a large earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, because it stands on soft ground and consists of few partition walls to support the structure.\n\nIn a notice posted last week, local authorities suggested renovating the building closest to the site of the explosion, as it is perceived to have the \"greatest historical value.\" However, the notice added that it was unclear whether the building would be safe to occupy even after renovations.\n\nAn interior shot of the former garment depot.

Instead, the more cost-effective approach would be to demolish two units and keep the most valuable one by reinforcing the walls and roof, which would only cost 800 million yen ($7.3 million).\n\nHe said a final decision has not yet been made, and the government is inviting the public to submit feedback on the proposal until February next year.\n\nThe building's exterior.

I think they are a valuable asset,\" he told reporters Thursday.\n\n\"Hiroshima city understands the need for safety measures and financial resources measures, but we are asking Hiroshima prefectural office to preserve entire buildings as much as possible.\"\n\nIwao Nakanishi was 15 years old and working at the depot when the bomb dropped. Several years ago, he founded the Committee for the Preservation of the Former Army Depot.\n\nNow aged 87, Nakanishi told CNN the buildings contain valuable lessons about the importance of peace.\n\n\"It is unacceptable to dismantle them,\" he wrote in an email. \"There is a significant historical value to pass on the lessons of tragedy to future generations.\"\n\nThe group organizes seminars and site visits where survivors share stories of their experience and spread the message of peace, according to its website.\n\nThe depot was one of the largest buildings that survived the atomic bomb, and survivors say it is too valuable to be torn down. Credit: Kyodo via AP\n\nMore than 15,000 residents have also signed an online petition calling on the Hiroshima government to preserve the depot.\n\nNaori Fukuoka, who started the petition, urged the government to utilize the facility as a historical and educational center for the public.\n\nOld army depot\n\nFirst opened in 1913, the depot was used for producing and storing military uniforms for Japanese soldiers before and during World War II, according to Adachi, the Hiroshima government official.\n\nThe building is characteristic of the architectural style of the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), which primarily used bricks and stones as construction materials, according to the Hiroshima government website. Architects used both reinforced concrete and bricks to strengthen its structure, which was uncommon at that time, it said.\n\nAfter surviving the atomic blast in 1945, the buildings were converted into teaching centers for a higher education institution that later became the education faculty of Hiroshima University. Less than a decade later, in 1956, it was rented to logistics company Nippon Express, before being abandoned in 1997.\n\nHiroshima considered converting the depot into a cultural museum, but the plan was dropped after surveys showed that the structure may be unsafe in the event of an earthquake.\n\nThe building's damaged exterior.

It is now part of the peace memorial museum in Hiroshima and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHowever, not every building that survived the atomic bomb has been preserved. Adachi told CNN that, since 1996, at least 10 privately-owned buildings have been demolished due to aging.\n\nFukuoka, who started the petition, wrote that the depot's preservation was especially important for Japan to pass on the message of peace to the next generations.\n\n\"Many survivors of the atomic bomb have shared their voices here,\" he wrote in the petition. \"Some history can only be preserved when it is kept in its entirety.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/hiroshima-building-atomic-bomb-army-depot-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2019-12-27T03:57:49+00:00"}, {"title": "Scientists just found one of the world's largest flowers blooming in an Indonesian jungle", "text": "(CNN) The rafflesia plant is often referred to as a \"monster flower\" for its parasitic properties and repugnant stench.

He opened the fridge and saw four different pizza boxes from four different restaurants.\n\n\"It's pretty embarrassing, but it's the truth,\" Sklar said. \"I just opened the door, and I was just like, 'What are we doing here?' \"\n\nAt 285 pounds (129 kilograms), he would sit on the couch and watch TV, with no energy left after conquering the work day. Late-night snacks included popcorn and ice cream. The 27-year-old, who works in sales for Corporate Strategies in Woodland Hills, California, knew something had to change.\n\nAnd gradually, his clothes felt like they were getting smaller every time he did laundry.\n\n\"It gets to that point where you realize that you're getting bigger; the clothes aren't getting smaller,\" he said. \"It was that a-ha moment.\"\n\nThere were other epiphanies as well. Sklar missed the feeling he got when he used to play sports as a teenager. And there was a history of heart disease in his family.\n\nTogether, he and his girlfriend, Samatha MacDonald, decided to make a lifestyle change. They had talked about doing it before, but this time, it stuck. They didn't want to look back 20 years from now and realize they could have made changes to be healthier then.\n\nJared and his girlfriend, Samantha, during their lifestyle change.\n\nFirst, they would start going to the gym. But they didn't want to put in the hours of fitness without having the right diet to fuel it and bring up their energy levels.\n\nOther diets sounded too quick for what Sklar wanted to do. He researched intermittent fasting and decided to try it as a sustainable long-term option.\n\nSklar and MacDonald would eat their meals between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, creating a 16-hour break before eating again. This helped them kick the late-night snacking habit.\n\n\"I like time restricted feeding because it allows you to naturally reduce your food intake without counting calories,\" said Lisa Drayer, CNN contributor and registered dietician. \"You eliminate mindless nibbling in the evening and you're also eating in sync with your circadian rhythm so you're front loading your calories, which is more favorable for weight loss.\"\n\nThey immediately noticed their energy levels start to pick back up as they swapped out pizza for proteins like turkey alongside vegetables, spaghetti squash instead of spaghetti and Greek yogurt bars instead of ice cream.\n\n\"When you're eating only during an eight-hour period, you do want to follow good nutritional guidelines, including protein, fiber, enough fluids in your diet as well,\" Drayer said.\n\nSklar loved eating healthier options, but sometimes had a hard time getting up to go to the gym. For MacDonald, food was a weakness, but she was excited to get up and work out.\n\n\"We pushed each in our weak areas,\" MacDonald said. \"We were on different pages initially but pushed each other to be on the same page, and that was a huge help.\"\n\nSklar was also dealing with a chronic hamstring issue, discovered by his doctor after playing flag football and repeatedly pulling his hamstring before the diet. His doctor recommended low-impact exercise, which led Sklar to try indoor cycling. He went to the gym six days a week and pedaled for 45 minutes each day.\n\nThe couple tried working out together, but found they slowed each other down. While Sklar was pedaling at the gym, MacDonald found that working out at a high-intensity interval training studio worked better for her.\n\nSklar and MacDonald also cut back on carbohydrates and replaced a lot of the red meat in his diet with leaner proteins like fish, chicken or ground turkey. They became more conscious of what they were eating overall, making healthier decisions during their eight-hour window each day.\n\n\"If you're only eating in these eight hours, it's powerful to choose what you put into your body,\" MacDonald said.\n\nThe first month, he had lost 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) while cycling and starting intermittent fasting. It continued for the next six months. Sklar fell in love with cycling. The combination of the music and the calories burned during each session fueled him to continue.\n\nSklar also found motivation when a close family member had to undergo triple bypass surgery in October.\n\n\"When you see that person in the hospital going through that, you just think to yourself that you never want that to happen to you, and you want to prevent it from happening to anybody else that you know,\" Sklar said. \"That was my why. That was a light bulb moment where I knew I had to not only keep this going, lose the weight for me, but I also needed to keep it going for my future self and everybody else around me.\"\n\nOver a six to seven-month period, Sklar lost 95 pounds (43 kg). Eventually, one of the instructors pulled Sklar aside and told him he should start teaching an indoor cycling class. He's been teaching for about six months now.\n\nFor MacDonald, the changes have been more mental than physical. She lost 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) and loves feeling stronger.\n\n\"On a busy day, the hour I'm going to the gym is something I'm giving myself,\" she said.\n\nWhen you realize you're gaining more muscle and feeling better every day, you can feel yourself getting stronger. That was a big thing. I had never stayed with a workout long enough to feel those changes after months. It makes me feel better every day to slowly see these changes in my body.\"\n\nIn the morning, Sklar usually has a glass of water after getting up. Lunch is at noon, followed by snacks throughout the day. Before a workout, Sklar enjoys peanut butter and jelly on a rice cake.\n\n\"I teach a spin class at 5:30 at night, then I'll have a protein shake and dinner right after, and then I'll maybe have a small snack at 8:00 p.m. I fast for the rest of the night until noon the next day.\"\n\nAfter the initial weight loss, Sklar and MacDonald are allowing for a little more flexibility if they have a special event. But they are committed to being as healthy and fit as possible for the long-term. Intermittent fasting helped them form healthy habits.\n\nSklar is also training for a triathlon now.\n\nSklar is much more energetic and confident after his weight loss.\n\n\"There's always something in front of me to keep me motivated, to make sure that I don't fall back into my old habits,\" Sklar said.\n\nSklar is continuing to fast and maintain an active lifestyle. He's more confident , energetic and positive. Sometimes, old friends and coworkers don't recognize him. As his story spreads, Sklar has been able to reconnect with friends or acquaintances and share advice on weight loss and fitness. Sklar didn't realize how much it would mean to him.\n\n\"I found that in the long run, I was doing it for my friends, as well, because they found inspiration from it,\" Sklar said.\n\nBeing able to make this lifestyle change with his girlfriend has made all the difference, Sklar said.\n\n\"It was hugely beneficial to have a support system with me,\" Sklar said. \"There's always going to be those days where you want to cheat and have a pizza, and just having a support system to keep you in check and being responsible for keeping somebody else in check was really important, to me.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/26/health/intermittent-fasting-jared-sklar-wellness-live-longer/index.html", "published": "2019-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Eat more plants and less meat to live longer and improve heart health, study suggests", "text": "(CNN) Eating more plants and less meat has been tied to a longer life and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in a new study.\n\nJUST WATCHED The best diets have this in common Replay More Videos ...

Read the policy\n\n(CNN) \u2014 There's no shortage of reasons to fall in love with Japan\n\nWhether you're hunting down top eats in Tokyo and Osaka or basking in the country's stunning landscapes , it's impossible to take it all in in one visit. But you'll certainly have a good time trying.\n\nWe've built the ultimate cheat sheet of top Japan experiences to help you plan your next visit. Also, be sure to click through the gallery on the top of this story of beautiful Japan destinations for more travel inspo.\n\nTHE GREAT OUTDOORS\n\nThough Japan might be most famous for its dazzlingly modern cities, you'll want to spend at least a few days exploring its stunning natural offerings. This is a nation that truly has it all, from rocky mountain peaks to white-sand beaches.\n\nHere are few Japan experiences that will allow for both relaxation and adventure.\n\nWinter sports\n\nAs winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible \"snow monsters.\"\n\nNagano, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, has long been a snowy escape for global travelers. But in recent years, Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido has become another leading destination for powder hunters thanks to its fresh, quality snow and amazing food scene.\n\nDown on the island of Honshu, meanwhile, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture offers skiing, onsen (more on that later) and \"snow monsters.\"\n\nFor something completely different, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route , dubbed the \"Roof of Japan,\" offers travelers a chance to drive down a highway framed by massive walls of snow that tower as high as 17 meters over the road.\n\nBeach hopping\n\nIt's easy to see why this stunning Iwate prefecture beach was named \"Jodogahama,\" or Pure Land. JNTO\n\nBeing an island nation, Japan's beach offerings are just as impressive as its skyscrapers and bullet trains.\n\nIn the north of Japan's main island, Jodogahama Beach (Pure Land in English) is a tranquil hidden beach with crystal-clear water and stark white rocks.\n\nIf you prefer softer (and darker) sand, Ibusuki Beach is your dream destination. The subtropical beach is famed for a unique activity -- sand bathing, or suna-mushi.\n\nFor island hoppers, you can check out a series of 260 tiny pine tree-covered islands in Matsushima.\n\nOnsen soaking\n\nEven macaques in Japan know how to enjoy an onsen. Koichi Kamoshida/Getty Images\n\nFor anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm. It's the rule.\n\nThe word \"onsen\" refers to Japan's natural hot springs but it also can represent facilities like spas and inns that pipe the waters into their own bathing areas.\n\nThough thousands of onsen exist throughout the country, Beppu is Japan's hot spring capital -- and for good reason. It's home to more than 2,500 hot springs and is the world's second-largest source of thermal spring water.\n\nFor travelers with ink, however, stripping down at a Japanese onsen can get tricky as many ban tattoos, which have been associated with yakuza gangs.\n\nFortunately, there's Tattoo-Friendly , a website featuring properties that allow ink. Users can narrow down the search by choosing the type of facility they want to visit -- gym, pool, hotel-and-ryokan (inn) or sento (public baths).\n\nEach listed property includes a brief description of the place and its amenities, as well its specific policies on tattoos.\n\nHanami\n\nEvery spring, Japanese celebrate cherry blossoms by gathering and picnicking at parks while admiring the pink blossoms. Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nFor just a few weeks every spring, Japan celebrates an annual ritual known as hanami: stopping to view and appreciate the beautiful spring blossoms.\n\nIt's so popular the Japan Weather Association's annual sakura (cherry blossom) forecast is broadcast live on TV, while the Japan National Tourism Organization has a regularly updated timetable of cherry blossoms predictions on their website.\n\nHiking\n\nA hike along the Kumano Kodo trail is a Wakayama highlight. Pongpat Patumsuwon/CNN\n\nBeing a mountainous nation, trekking is an extremely popular Japan activity.\n\nFor a spiritual journey, try Kumano Kodo , a multiday pilgrimage across Wakayama prefecture -- fueled by great food, cute rural villages and rich culture along the way.\n\nMore than a thousand years ago, imperial leaders and aristocrats made their way to the main Kumano Kodo shrines through a network of hikes across the island. At the end of the hike we recommend spending the night at a temple in the mountaintop town of Koyasan , the center of Shingon Buddhism.\n\nHere, ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops.\n\nThe enchanting Yakushima forest (the setting for Hayao Miyazaki's epic film Princess Mononoke) on Kyushu island and the Sagano bamboo forest on the outskirts of Kyoto are other family-friendly places to enjoy a quiet walk in Japan.\n\nTRADITION\n\nJapan excels at striking the right balance between tradition and modernity, leading the way in technological advances while also embracing its past, whether it's architecture, art, fashion, food or sports.\n\nHere are a few experiences that will give you a taste for Japan's traditional side.\n\nStay in a ryokan\n\nNishimuraya Honkan is a seventh-generation ryokan in Hyogo prefecture. Courtesy Nishimuraya\n\nLooking for that classic Japanese inn experience, complete with tatami floors, onsen and sliding doors?\n\nStaying in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese guesthouse, is the way to go. Catering to all budgets, they can be found throughout Japan -- most commonly in the countryside outside of urban centers.\n\nGuests are encouraged to wear yukata (house kimonos) and socks, while traditional Japanese meals are prepared in-house.\n\nFor some truly exquisite inns, check out our feature highlighting six of Japan's most beautiful ryokans\n\nTea ceremonies\n\nCNN's Paula Newton travels to Fukuoka and the surrounding tea-rich lands to experience the traditional winter tea ceremony.\n\nThe Japanese tea ceremony, or chado , is a traditional way of preparing and serving matcha (top quality green tea).\n\nTo make it, green tea leaves, grown in the shade, are dried and ground into a fine powder. This allows the tea to retain its nutrients. During the ceremony, which focuses on the rituals and mental states achieved in the process, the powder is whisked with hot water in a small bowl until a slight foam appears.\n\nThe top place to experience Japan's matcha tea ceremony -- or just enjoy a few cups of the precious drink -- is Kyoto. There are plenty of tea making classes and demonstrations available in English and other languages.\n\nKimonos\n\nIt can take up to two years to make a high-end kimono. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJapan's most beautiful traditional attire, kimonos are undeniably an expensive souvenir to bring home. One reason for their hefty price tag is the painstakingly detailed process that goes into making them.\n\nAnother reputable kimono-making company is Okaju in Kyoto, founded in 1855 and now helmed by the fourth generation Shigeo Okajima.\n\nIf you'd simply like to don one during your Japan visit, there are a number of rental companies throughout Kyoto.\n\nPrefer to appreciate these beautiful garments from afar? Kyoto's Gion district is where travelers can view graceful geishas, traditional Japanese entertainers, walking down the street in their kimonos.\n\nSumo watching\n\nSumo wrestling dates back at least 2,000 years. AFP Contributor/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSumo is as ancient as it is quintessentially Japanese. Historians agree that the sport dates back at least 2,000 years, and in its current form has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period.\n\nBut scoring a seat at one of Japan's six major sumo tournaments per year might as tough as getting into the ring and wrestling yourself, though with a little advance planning you can make it happen. Tickets are available through Japan's official sumo website\n\nThere are other ways to get close to a sumo wrestler.\n\nWhen they're not competing, sumo wrestlers train year round in designated sumo stables, or beya.\n\nThese stables, which are mostly based in Tokyo's Ryogoku neighborhood, are where the city's wrestlers live, eat, sleep and practice on a near daily basis. In recent years, it's become more common for foreigners to visit the morning practice, which begins at about 5 a.m. and lasts three to four hours.\n\nRead more about Japan's sumo stables here\n\nCUISINE\n\nJapan is a culinary wonderland thanks to its unique heritage, a national obsession with food and an almost religious embrace of freshness and perfect production.\n\nHere are a few of the country's must-try dining experiences. Been there, ate that? For a deeper dive into the country's culinary wonders, check out our list of 25 top Japanese dishes\n\nSushi\n\nl e v a r t\n\nChances are, sushi is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think \"Japanese food.\"\n\nMore than just a slice of fish over vinegar rice -- that is only one type, called nigiri -- mastering the art of sushi can easily take a lifetime. Luckily, there's Sushi University , where travelers can learn to distinguish nigiri from nori-maki.\n\nAlmost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.\n\nWhether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.\n\nIf you're up for a splurge, Sushisho Masa (106-0031 Tokyo, Minato City,Nishiazabu, 4 Chome\u22121\u221215) in Tokyo's Roppongi neighborhood is nothing short of perfection.\n\nAnd then of course there's Sukiyabashi Jiro , the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro earned global fame following the 2012 documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi.\"\n\nKobe beef\n\nOnly 3,000 cattle are classified as Kobe grade each year. \u00a9JNTO\n\nKnown for its pervasive marbling and melt-on-your-tongue texture, Kobe beef is one of Japan's most prized meats.\n\nA type of Wagyu beef named after the region in which the cattle are raised, Kobe is relatively rare -- only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade.\n\nThis has caused a fair bit of confusion but here's an easy way to remember it. Wagyu (which literally means \"Japanese cow\") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline.\n\nThe Kansai region, where Osaka is based, produces the three \"king\" varieties of Wagyu: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty.\n\nFind out more about Japan's various types of beef here\n\nSoba\n\nWant a seat at Kyourakutei? You'll have to wait in line. CNN meets up with the man behind this popular Michelin-starred Tokyo soba restaurant.\n\nSoba, or Japanese buckwheat noodles, are usually served cold with dipping sauce (called zaru soba) or served hot in dashi broth.\n\nTriumphing over them all is te-uchi, which means \"handmade,\" soba in Japanese. The hand-kneaded and cut soba offers the best firmness and, hence, is more much tastier than the mass-produced variety.\n\nFor a truly unique soba experience, head to Iwate, a prefecture in Japan's northeast where you can enjoy a 400-year-old all-you-can-eat noodle tradition called \" wanko soba .\"\n\nOne wanko soba restaurant claims a diner ate 570 bowls in one sitting.\n\nYakitori\n\nOne of the best reasons to visit a pub in Japan? Yakitori, Japanese style chicken skewers. \u00a9JNTO\n\nA yakitori restaurant is where you can sample every part of the chicken -- from chicken breast to skins to gizzards -- all presented on skewers, Japanese style.\n\nTokyo's Torikado is one of the best places to enjoy them. A high-end omakase yakitori restaurant, Torikado's diners will leave it up to the chef to decide what they eat.\n\nAnother popular way to chow down a few chicken skewers is with a beer at an izakaya, or casual Japanese pub. Here's our selection of the best (and affordable) izakaya in Tokyo\n\nKaiseki\n\nKaiseki meals were originally intended to be enjoyed before a tea ceremony.\n\nJapan travelers researching a trip to Kyoto will inevitably come across the word \"kaiseki.\"\n\nTo the outsider, it appears to simply be a multicourse Japanese dinner made up of beautifully plated dishes. But there's so much more to this meticulously prepared, exquisitely served and, usually, very expensive meal.\n\nTo practitioners of this haute cuisine, kaiseki is the embodiment of \"omotenashi,\" which means wholehearted hospitality.\n\nWanna know more? We followed chef Hisato Nakahigashi of Miyamasou, a two Michelin-starred restaurant and ryokan, to put together this beginner's guide to kaiseki meals\n\nRamen\n\nRamen is the ultimate Japanese comfort food. \u00a9Hiroshima Prefecture/\u00a9JNTO\n\nNothing's more comforting than slurping back a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day.\n\nThere are four basic styles of the world-famous soup-based dish: Shoyu (soy sauce seasoning); shio (a light soy sauce version of shoryu); miso (made with fermented soy beans); and tonkotsu (a creamy-white pork bone broth).\n\nCNN Travel asked Brian Mac, founder of the blog Ramen Adventures , to share some of his favorite ramen varieties in Tokyo and beyond, which include Hokkaido's miso ramen, Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen and all kinds of shoyu variations. Read more about them here\n\nSake\n\nA one-minute tour of Japan's northern Tohoku region, which produces some of the country's best bottles of sake.\n\nJapanese rice wine, sake has a long-standing history dating back to the third century.\n\nIt's produced all over the country -- and many brewers are open to tours -- but Japan's Tohoku region in the northeast is where you'll find some of the best bottles.\n\nPart of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku.\n\nFor visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tastings -- but you will need to book in advance via their websites.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/japan-top-experiences/index.html", "published": "2019-10-23T01:54:57+00:00"}, {"title": "Wakayama rafting: It's on logs -- and standing up!", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Think sitting in an inflated raft while rushing down white-water rapids is hardcore?

Japan is a popular place.\n\nWith close to 30 million international travelers heading there in 2018, tourists visiting traditional hotspots such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka during peak travel periods -- say, cherry blossom season in the spring -- will find themselves battling overwhelming crowds.\n\nBut the northern region of Tohoku remains surprisingly undertraveled in comparison, making it a fantastic destination any time of year.\n\nLocated at the tip of Japan's main island of Honshu, Tohoku is made up of six prefectures: Aomori, Akita, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi and Yamagata, all of which are filled with dramatic landscapes, historical attractions and culinary delights.\n\nHere's a sample of some of the top Tohoku experiences on offer. For even more ideas, click through the above gallery.\n\nZao Onsen, where snow monsters roar\n\nAs winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible \"snow monsters.\"\n\nThe Tohoku region gets some of the world's biggest dumps of snowfall each winter, making it a great alternative to traditional ski resort destinations such as the wildly popular Hokkaido to the north.\n\nOne of the most foreigner-friendly destinations in the area, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture is well-equipped to welcome powder hunters looking for some time on the slopes.\n\nBut the real reason to visit is to see Japan's famed snow monsters -- or \"juhyo\" in Japanese.\n\nEvery winter, as Siberian winds rush though the Zao Mountain Range, trees begin to collect thick, juicy layers of snow and ice. The trees freeze into fascinating humanesque forms.\n\nTo access the snow monsters, head for the Zao Onsen Ski Resort , which is spread over several peaks.\n\nIt's a mid-sized facility that's ideal for beginner and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Zao's longest downhill course is a 10-kilometer stretch that starts up at the snow monster observation area.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThe best time to see the monsters is late January to early March, before the spring warmth seeps in.\n\nIf you can't make it in winter, there's still plenty to see. For instance, the gorgeous Okama Crater Lake is surrounded by the three peaks of Tohoku's Zao mountain range.\n\nIt was named after \"kama,\" a traditional iron pot that shares its shape, and can be visited in the summer months.\n\nAkita, birthplace of Japan's most beloved dog breed\n\nJapan's adorable Akita dogs are famed for their loyalty. BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEmployed as everything from mascots and resort greeters to train station masters, Japan's adorable Akita Inu dogs -- which originally come from Tohoku's Akita prefecture -- have been charming the nation for decades.\n\nThe most famous Akita is Hachito, who was immortalized in film and has his own statue In Shibuya, Tokyo.\n\nAccording to the legend, Hachito visited Shibuya station every single evening for a year to greet his caretaker after work. Sadly, one day his human friend died while on the job and did not return. Nevertheless, Hachito continued to visit the same spot every day for nine years.\n\nHow's that for loyalty?\n\nMore recently, a band of Akita dogs was employed by a regional tourism body to create what might just be the strangest pop music video we've ever seen. (Check it out below.)\n\nWant to meet some of these canine cuties in person? Head for Odate, Akita's capital.\n\nThe Akita Dog Visitor Center at Odate Station is home to two honorary station masters, while the Akita Dog Museum offers a look at the history of these cute canines.\n\nFor more on the dogs -- and where to meet them -- visit the Akita Inu Tourism website\n\nWanko soba: An all-you-can-eat noodle binge\n\nAt the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, brave eaters can eat as many bowls of soba as they want for 3,240 yen (or $31.80). It's also known as Japan's Wanko Soba Noodle Challenge.\n\nOnly for the hungry, the wanko soba challenge is an all-you-can-eat buckwheat noodle binge unique to Japan's Iwate prefecture.\n\nHere's how it goes: A server brings tiny bowls of noodles, laying them down one after another as quick as you can slurp them back.\n\nAs soon as you empty a bowl, she'll swoop in to fill it with another mouthful, yelling \"hai dan dan!\"\n\nThere's only one way to ebb the noodle flow -- put a lid your wanko (bowl).\n\nRelated content The ultimate all-you-can-eat noodle binge\n\nThere are a few rules involved.\n\nFor starters, you have to eat continuously. You can't take a break and digest your noodles then come back to the table for more.\n\nWe recommend trying it at the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, Iwate's capital.\n\nThere are four Morioka locations but the Ekimae branch is just a two-minute walk from the train station and has English-language menus.\n\nFor a full list of wanko soba restaurants, visit Japan-iwate.info/noodle/wanko.html\n\nMatsushima: Japan's most scenic views\n\nl e v a r t\n\nMatsushima is one of the fabled \"Nihon Sankei\" -- or \"Three Views of Japan.\"\n\nMore than 260 tiny, pine tree-covered islands dot the waters of Matsushima Bay, creating a scene that's been the muse of dozens of Japanese poets and artists through the ages.\n\nTo truly appreciate Matsushima's beauty, head straight for the shore near the Matsushima Kaigan train station. Several islands are connected to the mainland by photo-worthy red bridges, such as the exquisite Fukuurabashi Bridge, which leads to Fukuurajima Island.\n\nHome to more than 300 species of flowers, plants and trees, the island's network of walking paths leads to several viewpoints.\n\nNearby, the beautiful Godaido Temple, founded in 807, sits on another small island that's also connected to the mainland via a series of red bridges.\n\nTo explore further afield, cruises depart from Matsushima Pier every hour. The 50-minute tour takes travelers around the bay, passing islands and oyster farms.\n\nDoesn't hurt that the food's amazing in Matsushima, too.\n\n\"Seafood in the Matsushima area is considered of the highest quality because the seafood harvested in the area benefits from the nutrient-rich water and plankton found off its coast,\" says award-winning author Hiroko Shimbo, an expert on Japanese cuisine who organizes culinary tours through the country.\n\n\"In addition to oysters there are such local specialties as salmon, skipjack tuna (katsuo), Pacific pike (sanma), northern clam (hokkigai), asari clams, abalone (awabi), scallops (hotategai) and the best-quality wakame (sea vegetable) -- don't call it seaweed!\"\n\nThe small but substantial Matsushima Fish Market is a fine place to kick off a culinary tour of the town.\n\nVendors here serve everything from ramen and sushi to oyster croquette burgers.\n\nSendai: Japan's beef tongue capital\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThough gyutan -- beef tongue -- is available at yakiniku restaurants all over Japan, Sendai is where you'll find the highest concentration of eateries solely dedicated to grilling up these juicy strips of meat.\n\nThe original beef tongue restaurant is Aji Tasuke, founded in 1948 by a man named Keishiro Sano.\n\nHe left Sendai to apprentice in Tokyo around 1935. It was there that he met a French chef, who he saw cooking up a beef tongue stew. Inspired, he decided to prepare it differently to suit Japanese tastes.\n\nAfter World War II ended, he returned north and opened a restaurant in Sendai.

Every day, the 71-year-old spends hours at an abandoned Macao shipyard, hunched over a table, hard at work. With only stray dogs for company and a single electric fan to keep him cool, he meticulously hand-crafts the sort of fishing boats that have been made here for generations.\n\nBut none of his creations will ever set sail. In fact, Tam's boats are miniatures designed to preserve the city's disappearing heritage.\n\n\"There is so much history in the fishing and shipbuilding industries,\" he says. \"I make model boats to show the craftsmanship and the building process (and) to educate people.\"\n\nFor centuries, the shipping industry was at the heart of life in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that was transformed from a small fishing village to a major port. In recent years, however, casinos have taken over as the city's main source of income.\n\nHistoric ship replicas nod to Macao's maritime past\n\nAnd with mainland China able to produce state-of-the-art metal fishing vessels, quicker and at lower costs, demand for traditional wooden boats all but disappeared.\n\nNo new boats have been made here since 2006. Not full-sized ones, at least.\n\nThree years ago, Tam -- who is considered a \"sifu,\" or master, of his craft -- was commissioned by a local temple to recreate a so-called \"junk\" boat in miniature form. He has since produced more than a dozen replicas of the very boats he spent his career making.\n\n\"We're not just building models,\" he said. \"It's about craftsmanship, shipbuilding and history.\"\n\nTam's makeshift studio is locatetd in an abandoned shipyard in the coastal Lai Chi Vun village. Credit: Herbert Chow\n\nTurning the tide\n\nTam's makeshift studio lies in an abandoned shipyard in Macao's Lai Chi Vun village. The space, which is crumbling at its edges having endured several of the region's worst tropical storms, is a shadow of its former self.\n\nBut for Tam, working in the very places he spent his youth is about more than finding a convenient studio -- it allows him to reminisce about the industry's boom era.\n\nShipbuilding in Macao hit its peak in the 1950s, when there were almost 30 shipyards across the region. By the 1980s however, the industry was in steep decline. Today, the wooden junks that once dotted the shores of Macao, and neighboring Hong Kong, have ceased to exist, save for a handful of tourist boats.\n\nMacao's shipbuilding industry hit its peak in the 1950s, but saw a steep decline by the 1980s. Credit: Horace Bristol/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n\"We thought it would go on for (a) long (time), we didn't see it coming,\" he recalls. \"I wonder how it went downhill so fast. How could I have known this would happen in my generation?\"\n\nAccording to Tam, this decline didn't just affect shipbuilders, but all aspects of life in Lai Chi Vun.\n\n\"At the (industry's) peak, people were rushing to work and it was lively. Those were happy times. We would work all year round and have people here dining together. Now, no one comes here to work, so no one comes here to talk to you.\"\n\n'Like a human body'\n\nTam believes that the miniature boats he creates are more than just models.\n\n\"The shipbuilding process is the same,\" he said. \"The only difference is the tools used.\"\n\nTam says he uses the same building techniques on his miniatures, as he used on his real ships. Credit: Herbert Chow\n\nThe complex techniques and precision required mean that Tam can spend up to 700 hours building a single boat, and will spend three months on each miniature on average.\n\n\"At our age, our eyes are not so good,\" he adds, \"so we are slower and can hardly see when it gets very dark... the small parts require more effort.\"\n\nThere is no room for error, with almost every component supporting another.\n\n\"It's just like a human body -- every part is important. If you don't have hands or feet, you can't eat or walk. No one part is more important than the other -- without each part, the boat cannot be completed.\"\n\nIn 2018, Macao's government recognized the Lai Chi Vun shipyard as a cultural heritage site. But the future of this craft -- and the culture surrounding it -- is dependent on the next generation, he says.\n\n\"Some people have started (providing miniature shipbuilding) classes in order to teach young people these skills, and to promote this culture,\" he adds.\n\n\"You need people to help with the preservation -- without the help of people, these skills will be lost.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/shipbuilding-macao-artisans/index.html", "published": "2019-08-19T02:38:13+00:00"}, {"title": "Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 With Tokyo set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events -- the Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics -- Japan's capital is making final preparations for the global spotlight.\n\nSo what will sports fans notice when they travel here?\n\nFirst of all, they won't be alone.\n\nTourism in Tokyo is already booming.

They will provide a great vibe.\"\n\nThe 'Olympics effect'\n\nl e v a r t\n\nJapan's government expects the \"Olympics effect\" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.\n\nIt's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for \"dramatic change.\"\n\n\"This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,\" said Koike.\n\nMajor developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.\n\nFeaturing a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nThe area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.\n\nTokyo's new Takanawa Gateway station will open in 2020 -- just in time for the Summer Olympics. JR East\n\nThis includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.\n\nAnother hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.\n\nOther changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen \"bullet train\" stations.\n\nTo assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.\n\nNew Olympics sporting venues\n\nIn terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.\n\nLocated on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.\n\nOn top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.\n\nVisiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nIt will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.\n\nBook those hotel rooms now\n\nThe Okura Tokyo has just reopened following extensive renovations. Courtesy Okura\n\nAccording to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.\n\nAmong the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.\n\nThe original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.\n\nHowever, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.\n\nStricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.\n\nBusinesses are encouraged to allow employees to work from home to ease pressure on public transportation during the Games.

When Ueno died unexpectedly, Hachik\u014d continued to visit the station every day for almost a decade.\n\nHis loyalty has become revered in Japan where he is known as ch\u016bken Hachik\u014d or \"faithful dog Hachik\u014d,\" and the breed is especially popular in the district.\n\nToday, a near constant line of visitors waits outside the station's exit named for him to take photos with a bronze statue of Hachik\u014d, sometimes offering a wreath of flowers in the summer or a hand-knitted scarf during the colder months.\n\n(Hachik\u014d was still alive and present for the statue's initial unveiling in 1932, but that model was recycled for the war effort, and the current statue is a 1984 remake.)\n\nEven the district's buses and vending machines are adorned with his smiling puppy face, and there's an official Hachik\u014d mascot who frequents the area.\n\nRelated content Japan's most beautiful ryokans invite you to do absolutely nothing\n\nBest viewing platforms\n\nShibuya Sky, at 47 stories, is the city's tallest tower and observation deck -- the views are something to behold.

Nor is it a luxury hotel.\n\nLocated in the capital's Otemachi neighborhood -- the political and financial district, near the Imperial Palace -- Hoshinoya Tokyo is at its core a ryokan (Japanese inn).\n\nHigh-end ryokans aren't common in Japan's big cities. They're more associated with natural settings far from urban streets -- near oceans or against backdrops of mountainous landscapes.\n\nHoshinoya Tokyo is located in the city's Otemachi neighborhood. Hoshino Resorts\n\nWith 17 floors filled with 84 rooms in a black tower that easily blends into its skyscraper-filled surroundings, you could be forgiven for scoffing at the idea there's anything traditional or inn-like about Hoshinoya Tokyo.\n\nUntil you experience the thoughtful design elements created by architecture firm Azuma that fill its spaces.\n\nFor instance, Hoshinoya Tokyo's exterior is cased in a metal lattice made up of patterns traditionally found on kimonos.\n\nBut unless you're a guest, that's where the tour comes to an end. Outside visitors are not allowed in.\n\nSeveral mini ryokans in one\n\nThere's no large, flashy entrance helmed by a white-gloved doorman where cars can pull in.

Beds are futon style -- but with luxurious, plush bedding.\n\nBreakfast is served in-room -- guests can choose from Western or Japanese cuisine.\n\nThis being a ryokan, a set of his and her kimonos can be found in your closet. Wearing them around the property adds to the ryokan vibe, as you pad across the bamboo and sandalwood scented tatami floors in sock-feet to go to dinner.\n\nWhere are the other guests?\n\nThis is a place that was designed for privacy, relaxation and quiet, so much so that you'll often feel like you're the only guest in the building -- and one reason it might not be suited for everyone.\n\nDuring a recent visit, the only sign of fellow travelers could be seen in the main lobby on the second floor, an area where guests can participate in demonstrations highlighting various facets of traditional Japanese arts, such as matcha tea ceremonies or classical music, as well as sake tasting sessions.\n\nThis welcome feeling of solitude extends to the ryokan's single, unnamed restaurant too.\n\nRelated content A Japan hotel devoted entirely to udon noodles\n\nLocated in the basement, it has just six tatami-matted private rooms with tables and seating, and an open space consisting of four tables and a counter.\n\nThe restaurant's multi-course dinner comes from the hands of award-winning chef Noriyuki Hamada -- much to the chagrin of local foodies. (Remember, guests only.)\n\nDiners are served a brilliant series of dishes dubbed Nippon Cuisine. According to the resort, this is \"a culinary style that focuses on fish -- a common staple of ryokan dining and a key element in Japanese culinary culture\" -- and prepared using French techniques.\n\nOpen-air soaks\n\nHoshino Tokyo's onsen includes an open-air section. Hoshino Resorts\n\nThis being a ryokan, there's of course an in-house onsen (hot spring bathing area). Water is piped in from 1,500 meters below the streets of Tokyo.\n\nIf not for the memorable cuisine of chef Noriyuki we'd go so far to say this is the star attraction of Hoshinoya Tokyo.\n\nLocated on the top floor, the onsen offers male and female bath halls, each with indoor and outdoor sections connected by a tunnel.\n\nLike many Japanese onsen, tattoos need to be covered -- a challenge considering you need to bathe naked. But hotel staff are happy to provide flesh-colored stickers to cover your ink with.

The images in this feature were taken during his recent trip to document the lives of Pashmina goat herders.\n\nAt an altitude of more than 14,000 feet, where winter temperatures can fall to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, it is hard to believe anyone, or anything, can survive in the vast ice desert that is Changthang, on the Tibetan Plateau between India and China. Situated between the Himalayan and Karakorum mountain ranges, it is the highest permanently inhabited plateau in the world, and home to an extremely hardy and rare breed of goat -- the Changra, or Pashmina goat.\n\nThe region's high altitudes, freezing temperatures and harsh winds are essential in stimulating the growth of the goats' super-soft undercoat. The fibers can measure a mere 12 microns in width, making them around eight times finer than human hair and up to eight times warmer than sheep wool. This luxurious fiber is known as Pashmina, the softest and most expensive type of cashmere wool in the world.\n\nRearing these valuable animals in such inhospitable conditions are the Changpa people. For centuries these nomadic shepherds, who are as hardy as their animals, have roamed \"the roof of the world,\" moving their herds of yak, sheep and goats along traditional migratory routes every few months in search of fresh grazing pastures.\n\nMoving thousands of goats over vast distances requires skill and experience if herders are to prevent injury to -- or loss of -- their animals. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nBut their ancient way of life is now under threat from climate change, fake Pashmina imports from China and the lure of an easier and more comfortable life.\n\nI have known of the Changpa people for some time, but it was only recently that I learned of their struggles. I visited them in the Ladakh region, on the Indian side of the plateau, to photograph their winter migration in early December.\n\nChangthang rarely gets much snowfall, and when it does, it usually begins in January or February. For the last few years, however, it has been increasingly heavy, starting as early as December, even November.\n\nThe goats naturally begin shedding their fur in the spring, and herders harvest it using a special comb. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nThe unexpected snowfall was great for my pictures, but it was a major inconvenience for the herders. The high pass they travel through is untraversable once covered in snow, and food supplements have to be brought in to prevent the animals dying from starvation.\n\nThe nomads and scientists alike are adamant that climate change is the biggest threat to Pashmina production in the region. And despite the snowfall, the winters are in fact getting warmer, which reduces the quality and quantity of the valuable Pashmina wool. Warmer temperatures mean that the goats don't grow such thick undercoats, reducing the yield of this soft fur and making it harder to separate from the coarse outer fur.\n\nOver a relatively short period of time, dozens of nomad families from the Changthang plateau have migrated away from their village, Kharnak, to the outskirts of Leh, a city 180 kilometers away. There, the herders who have given up their nomadic lives have set up their own neighborhood, called Kharnak Ling.\n\nA yak caravan winds its way across steep valleys. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nOn my recent visit to the region, the chief of Kharnak village, Targais Tashi, expressed his concerns. \"These are worrying times we are experiencing,\" he said. \"If weather patterns continue (changing) like they are, then it could have an irreversible impact on Pashmina goat-rearing on the Changthang. There were once more than 90 families in Kharnak and now there are only 16. If the number Changpa families in Kharnak fall below 10 then it will become too tough for us to continue this life.\n\n\"The younger generation would rather work in the city and cannot be persuaded to continue this physically, mentally and emotionally demanding existence.\"\n\nDespite the herders' brutal living conditions, they are some of the friendliest and most generous people one could ever wish to meet. They let me live with them and capture moments of their life on the understanding that I would spread awareness of their struggles. The region is desperately hoping that revenue from international tourism can help fill the economic hole left by the struggling Pashmina industry.\n\nMany Changpa women have abandoned their nomadic lives, and now weave the wool outside the city of Leh. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nThe Indian government's Ministry of Textiles has attempted to reverse the trend by providing funding and supplies to encourage the Changpas to return to rearing goats on the plateau.\n\nIn recent years however, due to a lack of Pashmina wool from Ladakh's herders, weavers in the wider Kashmir region have begun importing raw Pashmina from China and Mongolia to meet ever-increasing demand for their products. Much of this Pashmina is not what it is claimed to be. Although the goats are the same breed, they are not reared in the extreme conditions required to stimulate the growth of the super-soft undercoat required to be considered 100% pure Pashmina.\n\nPashmina is expensive -- and rightly so. The Changpa carefully comb the goats' hair during the spring molting season to harvest the downy undercoat, and then the good fiber is laboriously separated from the bad by hand. Once cleaned and processed, the usable wool from a cashmere goat amounts to just four ounces.\n\nEvery few months, the herders migrate with their yak, sheep and goats in search of fresh grazing pastures. Credit: Andrew Newey\n\nThe fibers are then hand spun, after which the equally painstaking weaving process can begin. A Pashmina shawl can take around 180 hours to produce, and larger items can take several months or even a year for highly skilled artisans to weave on wooden looms. They are then exported around the world, where luxury retailers sell them for hundred or thousands or dollars.\n\nAmid decreasing herd populations and increasing demand for cashmere from the Ladakh region, scientists at the University of Kashmir set out to produce the world's first Pashmina goat clone. In 2012, the female kid Noori was born. But the idea of using clones more widely has proven controversial among the Changpa herders, who see it as incompatible with their Buddhist beliefs.\n\nThe perils to goat rearing in turn threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the region who, directly or indirectly depend on Pashmina. The trade's decline could also spell the end of the unique culture of the Changpas, for whom livestock are more than a source of income, but a way of life.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pashmina-goat-herders-struggle-against-climate-change/index.html", "published": "2020-01-02T08:51:29+00:00"}, {"title": "Why movie villains love modern architecture", "text": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nAs James Bond in the 1974 classic \"The Man with the Golden Gun,\" actor Roger Moore pilots a seaplane above the clear gemstone waters of Thailand's Phang Nga Bay, meant to be somewhere off the coast of China.\n\nBond's antagonist, the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, has fortified his hideout within a towering limestone karst. When 007 enters the secluded home, Scaramanga's henchman, Nick Nack, flips a switch from the home's control station, sending the hero into a dizzying red-lit funhouse of horrors.\n\nScaramanga's hideout in \"The Man with the Golden Gun.\" Credit: Eon Productions\n\nMiami-based architect Chad Oppenheim first saw the film and Scaramanga's hideout when he was seven years old. It was the start of an obsession with the ultimate lair. \"Either I could become a supervillain and build one of these (lairs), or become an architect,\" he said.\n\nOppenheim explores his darker road not traveled in \"Lair,\" a recent book from Tra Publishing, that renders 15 highly secretive dwellings in black-and-white architectural drawings. They include the Nordic alpine hideaway in \"Ex Machina,\" the spidery underwater sea home in \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" the sleek Mount Rushmore abode in \"North By Northwest,\" and the eerie Brutalist Wallace Corporation HQ in \"Blade Runner 2049.\"\n\nA still from \"Blade Runner 2049.\" Credit: Columbia Pictures\n\nThe lairs generally share commonalities: They are pristine, awe-inspiring, high-tech, otherworldly, often impractical, and draw heavily on the tenets of modernism. The book poses the question: Why do bad guys live in good houses?\n\n\"Villain's lairs always have the sexiest architecture, inviting you to be the bad guy,\" said Leah Greenblatt, critic-at-large of Entertainment Weekly, at a panel in New York City for the book. Besides the titular childhood home in \"Skyfall,\" she asked, \"does James Bond even have a home?\" Oppenhenheim toyed with the idea of the hero's hideout too -- the Bat Cave, the Fortress of Solitude -- but generally finds supervillains have \"a little bit more depth to them,\" he said.\n\nOppenheim and his team came up with a rubric for which hideouts made the final cut -- and what counted as true villainry. \"First, primarily, the lairs had to be aspirational. They also had to be incredibly beautiful from an architectural standpoint,\" he explained. They omitted the lavish John Lautner-designed mansion of porn director Jackie Treehorn in \"The Big Lebowski,\" not deeming him a real antagonist. Darth Vader's hellfire stronghold in \"Star Wars\" also lost out in favor of the Death Star because Oppenheim decided nobody would actually want to live on an untenable volcanic planet.\n\nThe Death Star from \"Star Wars.\" Credit: Lucasfilm\n\nThey also opted for bad guys who had grand visions for humanity, not so much the brutal nature of serial killers like Hannibal Lecter. \"They're very utopian, in a way, in that they believe they're actually doing the right things -- like most megalomaniacs,\" Oppenheim said. Their chosen architecture represents their colorful personalities. \"A lot of these villains either want to be old-world gentlemen or they want to be super hyper-modern, and there's not really an in-between,\" Greenblatt noted -- except for the high-tech exterior, \"Downton Abbey\"-like interior of Karl Stromberg's sea arachnid, she conceded.\n\n\"Lair\" examines how modernist, futuristic, and utopian architecture has long been associated with amorality. Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, sleek homes, equally minimal and extravagant, made of glass, steel, and concrete, have become the archetypal home for the idealistic recluse with dastardly ambition.\n\n\"Modern domestic architecture has become identified almost exclusively with characters who are evil, unstable, selfish, obsessive, and driven by pleasure of the flesh,\" Joseph Rosa writes in an essay in the book. \"Were they still alive, this might thoroughly shock the pioneers of modernism, who envisioned their movement facilitating a healthy, honest, and moral way of life.\"\n\nDon Draper's New York pad. Credit: AMC\n\nWhile family life on television has most often been portrayed in cozy, traditional settings, modernist digs have been reserved for wayward bachelors -- like Don Draper of \"Mad Men\" leaving his suburban colonial home with Betty for cleaner lines and a new love interest in Manhattan.\n\nModern architecture has not been as readily embraced by Americans. In addition, Rosa points out, mistrust of technology following World War II deepened the idea that progress and innovation could be dangerous.\n\nProduction designers often reference Brutalism's monumental poured concrete forms or Constructivism's collective social ideas to build out dystopian settings. The Ken Adams-designed bunker in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and the bleak tower blocks in \"A Clockwork Orange\" both follow this lineage. On the panel, film critic Chris Nashawaty commented on Constructivism: \"It's an architecture of propaganda, and like all these villains or dictators or communist rulers ... it's all about convincing people that there's power and thought and might.\"\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nIllustration of The Vandamm House in \"North By Northwest,\" from \"Lair.\" Credit: Courtesy Tra Publishing\n\nBut many supervillains are drawn to the natural world as well. Such inclinations find an unlikely influence in Frank Lloyd Wright, whose organic architecture movement preached a symbiosis with the environment. Hollywood often finds its favorite lairs in the designs of architect and Wright protege John Lautner: the Hollywood Hills lookout homes in \"Body Double\" and \"Lethal Weapon 2,\" and the desert hideout in \"Diamonds Are Forever.\" Wright's presence appears again in \"North By Northwest.\" Hitchcock asked the architect to build the home perched atop Mount Rushmore, but couldn't afford him and built a set inspired by the architect's work instead.\n\nHarnessing the power of nature itself is the ultimate feat of ambition. In \"The Incredibles,\" Buddy Pine's volcanic island home boasts a wall made of lava. \"Star Wars'\" Death Star resembles a moon, but has the power to destroy entire worlds -- an idea that was drawn from history: The US, Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany all considered the potential of a deadly orbiting satellite.\n\nOppenheim sees a link between our own destructive behaviors and the villain's impulse to dominate nature. \"We've really tried to conquer the planet. (Our) civilization has manipulated nature to its advantage, and we're just building more and more,\" he said.\n\nVillains represent our worst inclinations with grandiose, destructive visions. They utilize their hideouts to retreat from humanity, taking refuge in immaculate spaces, their complicated defense systems, and the privacy of secret chambers or a far-flung volcanic crater lake.\n\nBut their desires are ultimately very human. \"These lairs are kind of mocking the whole idea of domesticity, because in a way that's what they want,\" Nashawaty said. \"They want these big houses. They want what everybody wants.\"\n\n\"Lair Radical Homes And Hideouts Of Movie Villains\" is available now from Tra Publishing.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect the film's location of Scaramanga's hideout in the \"The Man with the Golden Gun,\" instead of the novel's location.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/movie-villains-modern-architecture/index.html", "published": "2019-12-24T09:10:14+00:00"}, {"title": "From the 'Iliad' to 'Circe': Culture's enduring fascination with the myths of Troy", "text": "In partnership with Written by Jan Haywood\n\nJan Haywood is a lecturer in classical studies at the UK's Open University. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\nThe story of the epic war fought over a woman has been told many times. It now lies at the heart of an ongoing exhibition at the British Museum.\n\nTroy: Myth and Reality \" introduces audiences to the history of the archaeological site of Troy (modern-day Hisarlik, Turkey), many of the different individuals caught up in the Trojan War and various later responses to this powerful legend in drama and literature.\n\nThat the story of the Trojan War should be the subject of a blockbuster exhibition comes as little surprise. Ever since classical antiquity, audiences have been consistently telling and retelling stories about the site of Troy and the heroic war that was fought there between the Trojans and the Achaeans (later conflated with the Greeks). The most famous telling of all perhaps is \"The Iliad\" from the 8th century B.C., composed by Homer, a figure shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe Homeric poem captures the story of a dreadful, ten-year war fought between two nations. It shows the major influence of powerful men on the battlefield, such as the Trojan prince Hector and the commander of the Myrmidons, Achilles. For these individuals, deeds performed in war will secure them \"everlasting fame.\"\n\nBut the poem also illustrates the horrendous impact of the war far away from the battlefield. In one memorable passage, Briseis, the captive prisoner of Achilles, laments the slaughter of her husband and children. It is a heartbreaking account that shows acutely the universal misery brought on by the bloodshed of war.\n\nPortrait of Homer, copy of an original dating from 200-100 BC. Credit: Courtesy British Museum\n\nTroy after Homer\n\nEver since Homer, people have looked to expand on and retell different aspects of the Trojan War in light of their own circumstances.\n\nThe 5th century B.C. Athenian playwright Euripides produced several plays that depicted the aftermath of the conflict. In his play \"The Trojan Women,\" Euripides centers the widows of Troy and the hardships they endure at the hands of their Greek oppressors, who divide the women like booty between themselves.\n\nIt is an uncompromising account that many have read as a biting commentary on the civil war fought between Athens and Sparta at the end of the 5th century BCE. The play does not glorify war and instead highlights its horrors through Troy's displaced women.\n\nPieces of parchment found in excavations at the site of Troy is displayed at the British Museum. Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOf course, the creation of refugees through warfare and the transportation of human bodies across geographic boundaries is a profound concern for audiences today. The ongoing Syrian civil war has created around 6.7 million refugees , who have been dispersed across the globe. And the recent shocking discovery of 39 Vietnamese nationals' bodies in a lorry in Grays, Essex in October is a ghastly reminder of the terrible conditions that many refugees have faced past and present.\n\nTroy today\n\nIn contemporary culture too, there has been a spate of interest in the stories and myths of Troy.\n\nThe exhibition shows clearly the impact it has had on the visual arts. Highlights include a 1978 collage by the African American artist Romare Bearden, titled \"The Sirens' Song,\" which recasts Odysseus' journey home after the war with African American subjects. Bearden's work employs the familiar story of Troy to give the African American experience a universal and classical representation.\n\n\"Judgement of Paris (after Rubens)\" from \"Helen's Odyssey\" (2007) by Eleanor Antin Credit: \u00a9 Eleanor Antin. Courtesy of the artist and Ronald Feldman Gallery, New York.\n\nAnother notable work is a print called \"Judgement of Paris\" (2007), pictured above, by the conceptual artist Eleanor Antin. The photo, which riffs on Peter Paul Ruben's \" Judgement of Paris \" (1639), highlights the powerlessness of Helen who sits looking outwards, forced to the margins of the image. Antin's work turns this on its head. Featured as part of a series called \"Helen's Odyssey,\" the photo challenges a tradition that has often vilified the Spartan queen Helen for her involvement in the war.\n\nA recent significant development has been the growing number of English-language fictional accounts about Troy written by women. These works retell and expand on various aspects of the Trojan War story from the perspective of the women involved. They range from Pat Barker's \"The Silence of the Girls,\" which retells \"The Iliad\" from the perspective of the story's women, to Madeline Miller's bestseller \"Circe,\" a feminist exploration of certain events from \"The Odyssey.\" Such works offer a potent challenge to a tradition that has been wholly dominated by male authors and male-centered stories.\n\n\"The Wounded Achilles. Marble\" (1825) by Filippo Albacini Credit: \u00a9 The Devonshire Collections, Chatsworth. Reproduced by permission of Chatsworth Settlement Trustees.\n\nAn especially impressive entry in this burgeoning group of women writers' works on Troy is Alice Oswald's 2011 poem \"Memorial,\" an idiosyncratic translation of \"The Iliad.\" The poem evokes various contemporary war memorials, such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, in its opening which lists the names of almost all the men whose deaths are reported in \"The Iliad.\"\n\nWhat's more, the poem records moments in which the soldiers of \"The Iliad\" die on the battlefield. In doing so, as in \"The Iliad,\" Oswald repeatedly draws attention to bereaved parents, widowed partners and fatherless children. In an age where technology has changed the methods and image of warfare, desensitizing us to such violence, works like \"Memorial\" are a timely reminder of the human costs of deadly conflict.\n\nIt is clear, then, that Troy and the stories that surround it continue to shape culture thousands of years after the Trojan War ostensibly occurred. This is what makes the British Museum exhibition so relevant for audiences today. The story of the Trojan War is a story of universal suffering that stretches past the battlefield. It is a story that highlights the absurdity of war, which at its core holds sentiments that ring as true today as they did in antiquity.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/culture-fascination-with-the-myths-of-troy/index.html", "published": "2020-01-03T01:22:20+00:00"}, {"title": "'Little Women': Costumes get a modern spin in Greta Gerwig adaptation", "text": "Written by Ananda Pellerin, CNN\n\nFrom the sinister, suit-clad cast of 2011's Cold War thriller \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,\" to Emma Watson's ballroom-ready Belle in 2017's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" British designer Jacqueline Durran is no stranger to costuming period films.\n\nThe secret to success for the Oscar winner -- she won an Academy Award in Costume Design for \"Anna Karenina\" in 2012 -- is her personal approach, designing as much for actors as she does for their characters.\n\nFor Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women,\" she dressed a star-studded cast including Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen, as the four March sisters.\n\nDurran's modern sensibility is matched only by her carefully researched designs, bringing to life the 2019 adaptation of the 1868 classic novel. CNN spoke with her in a phone interview from London.\n\nCNN: How did you channel the era and characters for \"Little Women\"?\n\nJacqueline Durran: The first thing I do for any project is research the period. For \"Little Women\" I looked at contemporary photographs and paintings, and at fashion magazines from the time, which were really just books on how to make things and small line drawings of what was fashionable.\n\nFlorence Pugh as Amy March (with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). Credit: Wilson Webb/CTMG/Sony Pictures\n\nI also looked at pictures of artists and radical communities, and people who were using photography to represent a different way of seeing things. I felt like that was the spirit of the March sisters.\n\nHow do you balance the fictional character with the actress playing her?\n\nIn the first fitting I'll have the research, and I just sit down and talk through with them what kind of elements I like.\n\nThen they start trying things on. At this stage it's usually just shapes to get a feeling of the silhouette of the character, what the mood is. Then you start thinking about fabrics and the number of costume changes, you sort of pull it all together into a story arc.\n\nWorking with the actress is by far the most rewarding way of doing it. I love actresses who are engaged in what they want to look like.\n\nDid you get that on \"Little Women?\"\n\n100%. Also, I've known Saiorse since she was twelve, when we both worked on \"Atonement.\"\n\nHow did you choose the color palettes for each of the March girls?\n\nThey were taken from the color of the notebooks that Marmee (the girls' mother, played by Laura Dern) gives them on Christmas Day.\n\nActress Saoirse Ronan as Jo March. Credit: Sony Pictures\n\nJo's color is red. I presume it reflects her temper, or her spirit. But I didn't want her to wear red really obviously throughout the whole movie, so I threaded the color in and out of her story. She often has a bit of red on but very rarely all red, though she does for the first party.\n\nIt was the same with Meg. I think her actual color was green, but we didn't want her to be just wearing that, so we balanced it with lavender.\n\nBeth's colors were pink to brown, which we ran with, and Amy's was light blue, which comes in and out of her story.\n\nAre there specific challenges to dressing an ensemble cast instead of a solo lead?\n\nYou have to think about the actress in the context of the other actresses. It also just means a lot of costumes. Instead of one leading lady with twelve changes, you've got five women with twelve changes -- that's already sixty costumes. It's a mountain of clothing to design and make, while keeping things fresh and not repetitive.\n\nBut the ensemble cast was one of the biggest pleasures for me, because the actresses were all amazing.\n\nThe costumes have a contemporary feel to them even though they are clearly period pieces -- how did you strike this balance?\n\nWhen I first met with Amy Pascal, the producer, and Greta, I got the feeling that while they wanted it to be accurate to the period, they didn't want something that felt too strictly Victorian in a way that meant you couldn't identify with the characters.\n\nI tried to make it seem like the actresses really lived in the clothes. They had leeway in how they wore them, and also reused things in different combinations so you got the sense that these were items from their own wardrobes. In the spirit of Greta's film, you don't feel like you're in a very formal world, you feel like you're in something much looser.\n\nThe March girls struggle with work-life balance, finding love, keeping family, creating a home and trying to be independent in the world. \"Little Women\" still feels relevant today.\n\nGreta often uses the example that Louisa May Alcott kept her copyright, but Taylor Swift currently has a problem with her own copyright. We're still fighting the same battles and the same issues around status.\n\nOne of the joys of this film is that you get to see four different women, and each way of being is equally valid. For instance, Jo comes off as smart about how the world works, while Amy is an artist who is going to make her way. But, 150 years on, I fear that economics for women are not as advanced as they should be.\n\nWhat was it like dressing Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays Jo's supportive friend Laurie?\n\nThe challenge of dressing men is finding a way to create character within a limited range of choices -- menswear just doesn't have the variety that womenswear does.\n\nBut with Timoth\u00e9e, I had a broad range of styles to draw from. I wanted to make him look like a privileged, artistic boy. I had some reference pictures of young boys dressed in velvet suits from the mid-nineteenth-century, and I combined that aesthetic with shapes from boyswear of an earlier decade.\n\nWhen it came to his later, grown-up costumes I pushed the reference later, into the 1880s, though one of the key references was a Tissot painting of a group of men in Paris in 1867.\n\nEmma Watson and Greta Gerwig on the set of Little Women Credit: Wilson Webb/CTMG/Sony Pictures\n\nEven ten years ago there would have been a high chance this film would have been directed by a man. Have you seen the industry change over your career?\n\nI have but not as much as you'd think. It's a bit like the world, you feel like things have moved on a lot and then you think, hang on, no actually we're still not there yet.\n\nI have worked with some women directors, but I'm thrilled there are more coming through. It would be great to get to a point where women represented different voices in directing, rather than just being women directors. We need a broad spectrum of people telling a broad spectrum of stories.\n\nGreta is one of those people, she is an inspiration. What she represented as a widely loved actress is what she's brought to the spirit of her directing. It's something that everyone can imagine and be enthusiastic about straight away. For her to take on this film and do such a great job is a big step forward.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/little-women-costumes-jacqueline-durran/index.html", "published": "2019-12-26T00:40:44+00:00"}, {"title": "Photographer Tania Franco Klein asks if we can ever truly disconnect", "text": "Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nA woman in red stands in a vacant parking lot, fabric billowing in an upward arc to obscure her face.

She's won awards from LensCulture, Sony Photography Awards and Photo London.\n\nKlein began examining modern anxieties following her graduation from London's University of the Arts MA program in 2016.\n\nAfter London, she became restless, moving between Madrid, Israel, California, and Mexico for one to two months at a time. Unmoored, her anxiety and depression began to grow. It wasn't just her, she realized -- many of her friends, living all over the world, were experiencing the same extreme unease over the future. In a bookstore in Madrid, she found the book \"The Burnout Society,\" by South Korean-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han, and it spoke to her -- the idea that as a society we are obsessed with performing, multi-tasking, optimizing, and self-improvement, fueling a collective and deeply rooted sense of anxiety and isolation.\n\nKlein captures the emotions of modern anxieties.

Her interiors \"are emotionally claustrophobic,\" she said, but her protagonists outside find little respite -- they are \"trapped in these barren landscapes.\" In these non-places -- a term coined by French anthropologist Marc Aug\u00e9 -- people relinquish their identity in locations where the only point is to simply pass through.\n\nKlein invites viewers to stay in these transient spaces and reflect on the stressors of contemporary life. \"You cannot fully escape and fully disconnect from everything, but how can you (find) balance?\" she asked.

It will also be used for soccer matches and various track-and-field events during the Games.\n\nThe stadium's roof was constructed using steel and latticed wood.

His oval-shaped design features three tiers of seats beneath a partially covered roof made from steel and latticed wood.\n\nThe architect sourced more than 70,000 cubic feet of timber -- from each of the country's 47 prefectures -- for the stadium.\n\n\"The Olympics always becomes a symbol for the era, so with the 2020 Olympics, we wanted to create something that captures the people's thoughts on the environment or the Earth at the time,\" he told CNN in an interview in June. \"So, we thought that the best material for this era would be wood.\"\n\nMore than 47,000 trees have been planted in the vicinity of the new stadium. Credit: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt Sunday's ceremony, Abe praised the design for achieving \"harmony with the surrounding environment and a Japanese character.\" But as recently as 2015, the new National Stadium could have looked dramatically different.\n\nA futuristic design by the late British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid had initially been selected, though Japan's Olympic organizers eventually scrapped the plan amid spiraling costs and high-profile criticisms. Celebrated architect Arata Isozaki described Hadid's design as a \"disgrace to future generations.\"\n\nThe reins were then passed to 65-year-old Kuma, and he set about reimagining the project in his characteristically organic style. The architect said that his stadium design was partly inspired by Tokyo's Edo-period temples.\n\n\"All over the world, architecture in the 20th century that uses concrete and steel feels cold and stiff. I want to make it softer, kinder, warmer,\" said Kuma, whose firm designed the venue alongside architecture firm Azusa Sekkei. \"I think that's the kind of architecture that humans need, during this stressful era.\"\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 68,000. Credit: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHis final design -- which replaces the existing National Stadium, built in the 1950s -- features large roof eaves that encourage air to circulate, allowing breeze to enter the stadium during hot weather. It is located in the Meijijingu Gaien park, which Kuma described as \"the greenest place in Tokyo.\"\n\n\"Of course, we would like both athletes and spectators to enjoy the stadium, but at the same time we thought of something we can contribute to the community,\" Kuma said, highlighting the pedestrianized areas he designed around the structure. \"We've designed a place where everyone in the community can enjoy a walk there,\" he added.\n\nThe late switch of design meant that construction on the stadium did not begin until late 2016. As such, plans for the venue to host matches in the recent Rugby World Cup were canceled\n\nWatch: Kengo Kuma on how buildings can create harmony\n\nThe venue will instead open to the public for the first time Saturday, with a launch event starring former sprinter Usain Bolt.

It's almost uplifting.\"\n\nKodachrome slides are rectangular pieces of color reversal film encased in cardboard that were loaded into slide projectors and beamed onto walls. The film itself was introduced by the Eastman Kodak Company in 1935, and it helped popularize photography among regular people after World War II.\n\nFine-grained and tonally rich, the film could record the hues of fabric and skin, atmosphere and light and, until electronic imaging became dominant, it was the way we captured moments on camera. In the early 1990s, home slides started falling out of fashion. In 2009, Kodak discontinued the iconic color film for good.\n\nSince 2017, Shulman has collected over 700,000 Kodachrome slides as part of The Anonymous Project, a Paris-based non-profit initiative that gathers, scans, digitizes and catalogs color photographic negatives and slides produced since the mid-20th century. It's now one of the world's most extensive collections of amateur slides.\n\n\"Each slide is a glimpse into our collective memory,\" Shulman said.\n\nIndeed, the photos -- all taken by amateurs, with varying degrees of photographic ability -- show situations familiar to most of us. There are pictures of newborn babies and first days of school, parties and family vacations, first dances and weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and older couples.\n\nThroughout, there's a sense of normalcy -- and the feeling that we haven't greatly changed the way we document our lives.\n\n\"As can be seen in these pages, people behaved with 35-millimeter cameras and Instamatics 50 years ago much as they do today with smartphones in the age of Instagram and Snapchat,\" writes arts critic Richard B. Woodward in the book's introduction. \"They took pictures of what they ate and drank, where they vacationed, how they celebrated.\" Just like we do today.\n\nThe filmmaker began collecting slides after buying a couple of 1950s Kodachrome boxes from eBay out of curiosity, and for very little money. When he opened them, he said he was \"stunned.\"\n\n\"I was suddenly staring at hundreds of pictures of strangers' lives in super vivid colors, despite the fact that they were over 60 years old. It was mind-blowing. I felt like I had to do something with them other than just keep them to myself. The whole idea for The Anonymous Project snowballed from there.\"\n\nAlthough most of the color negatives remain vibrant, their shelf life is limited. Shulman said they aren't meant to survive longer than 50 years, as the chemicals on the film degrade over time -- which is why he's scanning as many as he can.\n\nNo captions, background information or specifics, like dates or times, accompany the frames, mostly because when Shulman acquired them they didn't come with any.\n\n\"Even in the rare instances I've had some access to the history of these snapshots, I decided to leave it out. For me, this is an interpretative experience,\" he said.\n\n\"It sounds cheesy, but I think these images really show how, even when we are so diverse, we still have similar ambitions, hopes, goals. And how we go through the same things. Looking at them is like realizing you're part of one big family.\"\n\nFor the book, Shulman selected photos according to his own personal inclinations, choosing those that spoke to him emotionally or visually. The frame of the laughing ladies was one. Another \"favorite\" depicts a young woman intently staring at the camera, as someone -- her lover, Shulman speculates -- is taking her photo. She's serious, but there's a certain tenderness to her whole demeanor.\n\nThe filmmaker applies that same subjective approach to The Anonymous Project's website and exhibitions, especially as the collection continues to expand.\n\nShulman said people from all over the world have sent him boxes of old Kodachrome slides, some of which have been forgotten for years in their attics.\n\n\"We have such a vast range of images now,\" he explained. \"Some resonate with me at certain times, some at others. So what the public see changes often.\"\n\nWhile \"Midcentury Memories\" finally publishes the images in book form, there may be much more to come from the project. \"There's a strong interest from people in exploring our collective memory,\" Shulman said. \"Today more than ever.

It can be a record of a specific place in time, a witness to political and social events, or a reflection of pop culture, trends and fads. Often, it's simply the most honest, unadulterated way of capturing people's daily lives.\n\nThe new book \"Magnum Streetwise\" explores each of these facets, tracing the evolution of the genre as recorded by Magnum Photos, the international cooperative of photojournalists whose founders include two of the forefathers of modern street photography, Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson.\n\nRecently published by Thames & Hudson, and edited by photographer and curator Stephen McLaren, the book includes over 300 images from some of street photography's greatest practitioners, from the 1930s to the present day -- Elliott Erwitt, Martine Franck, Bruce Gilden, Steve McCurry and Susan Meiselas, among others.\n\n\"Street photography is still the lifeblood of Magnum,\" McLaren said in a phone interview. \"The book is a homage to the people that made it so.\"\n\nAn image taken Norwegian photojournalist Jonas Bendiksen in Abkhazia, on the coast of the Black Sea.

The idea, McLaren explained, was to illustrate the wealth of styles, techniques and approaches applied to different subjects by different masters, as well as each city's distinctive visual traits.\n\nA 1955 shot taken in Colorado, USA, by Magnum photographer Elliott Erwitt. Credit: Elliott Erwitt/Magnum Photos\n\n\"Street photography is so incredibly layered,\" McLaren said. \"It's possibly the most candid visual representation of the world around us.\"\n\nThe \"streetwise\" of the title hints at the photographers' ability to \"paint\" a picture by being acutely aware of their surroundings and capturing it in a single moment.\n\n\"Streetwise photographers are instinctive readers of body language,\" McLaren writes in the introduction of the book. \"They can sense when someone is about to yawn while waiting to cross the road, and they revel in the rituals of a group of friends sitting together on a night out.\n\n\"To be able to approach such a scene, unobtrusively get within camera range and take one or two frames, and then depart leaving the subjects untroubled and the location untouched is akin to being a cat burglar. To pull this off is to be a master of distraction.\"\n\nRelated video: Photographer Martin Parr on Britain in the time of Brexit\n\nBeing able to sense \"that moment when reality quivers with photographic possibility,\" is also what makes the featured Magnum photographers streetwise, McLaren points out.\n\n\"Unlike photojournalism, which involves a very strict way of telling stories, permits and so on, street photography is more instinctual, and almost allows for more artistic leeway,\" he explained. \"These images all share that quality.\"\n\nThe photos in \"Magnum Streetwise\" tell diverse micro-stories specific to their authors and settings -- for example, a girl on Tokyo's metro, captured by Gueorgui Pinkhassov in 1996 and pigeons scattering over Trafalgar Square in London, by Sergio Larrain circa 1958.\n\nOthers are extended works of observation, like Herbert List's contemplation of the limited view from his window in the summer of 1953 in Rome, when a foot injury kept him confined to his apartment.\n\nA shot taken by Herbert List from the window of his Rome apartment, where he was confined with a foot injury at the time. Credit: Herbert List/Magnum Photos\n\n\"Video, VR and new technologies are increasingly shaping the way we approach and digest what's around us,\" McLaren said, \"but street photography is shrouded in a sense of mystery hard to replicate. And it's still very much a relevant expression of how the world works.\"\n\n\"Street pictures don't give out or tell you what you're seeing. They make you ask questions, and ask yourself 'What happening here?'

The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.\n\nThe trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.\n\nQuite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.\n\nHis ongoing \"Beijing Silvermine\" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.\n\n\"The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,\" he said in a phone interview. \"There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.\"\n\nWhile the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half \"looking for gems,\" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.\n\nMost of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.\n\nThe pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.\n\n\"I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,\" Sauvin said. \"You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.\n\n\"But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.\"\n\nRecurring themes\n\nWhat remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls \"the ritual\" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.\n\nSome common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.\n\nNew ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (\"Go around the world in just one day,\" its catalog boasted).\n\nWhat initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.\n\n\"It seems to be quite a meaningful place,\" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. \"It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.\"\n\nFading memories\n\nSauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.\n\nThe image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (\"like a mermaid,\" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he \"knew the guy like he was my grandfather.\"\n\nAfter Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.\n\n\"He was very happy, and we had a very good time,\" Sauvin said. \"In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'\"\n\nAlthough now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a \"still very reasonable\" 75 yuan (just under $11).\n\n\"It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,\" he said. \"But that's part of the game, I suppose.\"\n\nThe supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.\n\n\"I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,\" Sauvin recalled. \"And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'\"\n\nHe took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.\n\nSauvin's latest project brings together found photos of athletes from a single day in 1960.

All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.\n\n\"I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,\" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, \"Great Leaps Forward.\"\n\n\"The photos were simply beautiful -- very calm, very poetic.

He compared Hollywood to Pachinko, a Japanese game that resembles a pinball machine: \"Everyone comes (here) wanting to be an actor and then they slowly filter down and find their slot.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, he had minor roles in blockbuster films, like \"Primal Fear\" and \"Legends of the Fall,\" but to support his acting dreams Slavin needed other side gigs. In his early 20s, he was working at a Chevron gas station in La Cienega, in Hollywood, when he decided to try his hand at taking photos.\n\nHe befriended the owner of a headshot photography studio across the street, who gave him some basic pointers, and soon after he was taking headshots of his friends -- including Hilary Swank, who, in one picture, had just chopped her hair off to express contempt for having been fired from the hit TV show \"Beverly Hills 90210.\"\n\n\"I was very fortunate that a lot of my friends... let me experiment on them, and it helped when they blew up and became movie stars. I certainly had a leg up on a lot of other photographers who were starting out,\" Slavin said.\n\nThe first celebrity portrait he took was of The Black Crowes' lead singer Chris Robinson at his \"hippie paradise in the hills above Sunset Boulevard,\" and Charlize Theron, a longtime friend, once invited him to tag along and document a trip to South Africa.\n\n\"I was breathing rarefied air, and I wanted to remember every single moment,\" Slavin wrote in the book.\n\nWith his camera in hand, Slavin seemed to be in all the right places at the right time. He captured an image of Leonardo DiCaprio -- right before the film \"Titanic\" was released -- hanging out with Theron at her birthday party in Hollywood's iconic Bar Marmont.\n\n\"You had these incredible places with people relaxing and letting their hair down,\" he explained. \"I don't know if that happens anymore.\"\n\nGoing through his archive, Slavin also found a few surprising faces: \"Six years before his breakthrough in 'Hustle and Flow,' Terrence (Howard) was at my birthday party. I didn't know him. I just held the camera aloft to get a shot. Years later I looked at the picture and realized he was looking directly into the camera,\" Slavin wrote in \"We all want something beautiful.\"\n\nSocial media has kicked the doors of Hollywood wide open, but Slavin's photos give insight into a time when celebrities could party in relative privacy.\n\nActor James Van Der Beek appears in the background of one photo, wearing a beard, glasses and a baseball cap. It was 1999 and he'd already shot to fame as Dawson Leery in \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\n\"Everything about it says, 'Pay no attention to the confused boy in the too-baggy jacket,'\" Van Der Beek said in an Instagram post, noting that Slavin's images captured a time before everyone carried a camera in their pockets.\n\nSlavin agreed. \"Everybody thinks their 20s were a special time, but I also think it was a special time because it was right before the internet, social media and cellphones. Those three things came along and privacy went out the window,\" he said.\n\nIt isn't easy to make it in Hollywood as an actor but it's equally hard to start out as a photographer.\n\nIn Slavin's case, his craft was given a boost by an all-access pass to the life of his Hollywood friends. But he wasn't driven by dreams of exposure. Slavin's early black and white images were simply intended as a visual diary of the great times they were all living.\n\n\"I was very fortunate to be at the right place in some very magical times,\" he said.\n\nLA feels enormous but when you're here it's a small town, a small little company town, and everybody works for the same factory.\"\n\n\"We all want something beautiful\" is available now from Mascot Books.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/randall-slavin-celebrity-portraiture-hollywood/index.html", "published": "2019-11-14T14:56:50+00:00"}, {"title": "Steve McCurry's photos show the complex relationship between humans and animals", "text": "Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\n\nSteve McCurry has achieved legendary status with his documentary photography, and is perhaps best known for his portrait of the \"Afghan Girl\" with the piercing green eyes published in 1985.\n\nBut the influential American photographer, who has built his career around his daring coverage of armed conflict, has a lesser known passion: animals.\n\nThey are the subject of a new book simply called \"Steve McCurry. Animals,\" published by Taschen.\n\nThe book compiles the photographer's favorite photos, from cats in Myanmar to camels in Jordan.\n\n\"Animals are one of my favorite subjects to shoot; they are completely unpredictable,\" said McCurry in an email.\n\n\"Animals are in constant motion, have a mind of their own and rarely pay any attention to directions from a photographer. Understanding animal behavior is essential to making good animal photographs, just as understanding human behavior can help with taking someone's portrait,\" he said.\n\nby Elliott Erwitt, titled \" The idea of photographing animals and people has been on McCurry's mind since he started out as a young photographer.

Many of the photos include human subjects, but those that don't hint at the presence of humans, or at least what they've left behind.\n\nOne of the most striking shots, winner of the 1992 World Press Photo award , was taken in Kuwait at the end of the first Gulf War.

Credit: \u00a9 2019 Steve McCurry, Long Island City, NY\n\n\"Working in Kuwait in the aftermath of the first Gulf War was a surreal and unforgettable experience,\" said McCurry. \"There were 600 oil fields burning, panicked and starved animals were wandering about, and the landscape was dotted with dead Iraqi soldiers.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see these animals, which we were supposed to be guardians of. Those animals that escaped slaughter were abandoned and left to wander the streets looking for food and shelter.\"\n\nMcCurry's collection extends far beyond war zones, to designer dogs in Beverly Hills, race horses in Hong Kong and goats in northern Pakistan.\n\nA man walks with a herd of sheep near Magdeburg, in the former German Democratic Republic, DDR, 1989.

With the simple use of wood and fabric, of shades of saffron from mustard gold to deep orange, their environment was serene. The patient cat completed the scene of contemplation and peace,\" he said.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Steve McCurry, Long Island City, NY\n\nThe wide range of countries and cultures represented in the images reflect different cultural attitudes towards animals and pets.\n\n\"Many of us believe that dogs are man's best friends, but in some cultures they are viewed as dirty and unclean. In other cultures, dogs are even a delicacy,\" McCurry said.\n\nWhat it's like to document a 'minor miracle'\n\n\"Cows are sacred in India, but in other parts of the world, beef symbolizes pride in their cattle industry. These disparities are often difficult to understand, but it is important to understand the sensibility and sensitivities in each geographic region, in order to have a full understanding of the local culture.\"\n\nA Mahout and his elephant at a sanctuary. Chiang Mai, Thailand, 2010. Credit: \u00a9 2019 Steve McCurry, Long Island City, NY\n\nMcCurry hopes, too, that his images will inspire a greater respect for animals, and a desire to address the dire predictions of mass extinction caused by human activity.\n\n\"This is an unimaginable catastrophe, but one that is sadly coming to fruition. We are losing species every year; wildlife is being decimated to the point where in a few years some species will cease to exist in their natural habitats.\"\n\nA snow monkey in Jigokudani Yaen-koen park, Japan, 2018.

It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\"\n\nSome 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\nOn Sunday, the coalition paused its operations against IS in Iraq, and Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave.\n\nThe resolution was pushed through by the parliament's Shia Muslim bloc - which is close to Iran.\n\nHow has Iran responded to the US?\n\nIran has announced it will no longer abide by restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal, under which it agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nUS President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Iranian MPs stood up in parliament and chanted 'death to America' for several minutes\n\nIran refused and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the deal.\n\nIn a statement, it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development.\n\nThe leaders of Germany, France and the UK - which were all signatories to the 2015 deal, alongside China and Russia - responded with a joint statement urging Iran to refrain from \"further violent actions or support for them\".\n\n\"It is crucial now to de-escalate. We call on all the players involved to show utmost restraint and responsibility,\" they said.\n\nWhat has Trump said about Iran?\n\nMr Trump has vowed to strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, \"perhaps in a disproportionate manner\".\n\nHe also repeated a controversial threat to target Iranian cultural sites on Sunday, despite criticism from within the US and overseas.\n\n\"They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way,\" the president said.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, Mr Trump said the US had identified 52 Iranian sites, some \"at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture\", and warned they would be \"HIT VERY FAST AND HARD\" if Tehran struck at the US.\n\nUS Senator Elizabeth Warren, a senior member of the Democratic Party, responded by tweeting: \"You are threatening to commit war crimes.\"\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif drew parallels with IS destruction of the Middle East's cultural riches.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Huge crowds poured into the city of Ahvaz in Iran to honour General Soleimani\n\n\"A reminder to those hallucinating about emulating ISIS war crimes by targeting our cultural heritage,\" he tweeted. \"Through MILLENNIA of history, barbarians have come and ravaged our cities, razed our monuments and burnt our libraries. Where are they now? We're still here, & standing tall.\"\n\nTargeting cultural sites is banned under the Geneva and Hague Conventions - and violating them would constitute a war crime in the US.\n\nHow soon could Iran develop a nuclear bomb?\n\nThe country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010.\n\nThe 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief.\n\nIt restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, to 3.67%. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and allow international inspections.\n\nBefore July 2015, Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges, enough to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the White House at the time.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption President Hassan Rouhani pictured at a nuclear plant in Iran in 2015\n\nUS experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called \"breakout time\".\n\nIran's current \"breakout time\", should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb, is estimated to be around a year, but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20%, for example."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51004218", "published":

Pay ratio reporting will rightly increase scrutiny on pay and reward practices, but reporting the numbers is just the start.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"We need businesses to step up and justify very high levels of pay for top executives, particularly in relation to how the rest of the workforce is being rewarded.\"\n\nLuke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \"CEOs are paid extraordinarily highly compared to the wider workforce, helping to make the UK one of the most unequal countries in Europe.\"\n\nMs Leadsom accepted that the figures were a concern, but said changes to the rules on reporting executive pay would help shine a light on the issue.\n\nShe said: \"Today's figures will be eye-watering for the vast majority of hard-working people across the UK.\n\n\"The numbers are better than they were - down a quarter since 2012 and 13% on average since last year - but the situation is still concerning, especially in those cases where executives have been rewarded despite failing their employees and customers.\"\n\nBut Ms Leadsom added that changes to the way companies report pay would \"increase transparency around how directors meet their responsibilities\".\n\nTUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said the report \"tells you everything about how unfair our economy is\"."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50985412", "published": "2020-01-06T05:30:16", "title": "New car registrations at lowest level since 2013", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nNew car registrations in the UK last year fell to their lowest level since 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of decline, and the SMMT expects that trend to continue throughout 2020.\n\nThose expectations are largely due to weak consumer confidence and confusion over clean-air legislation.\n\nThe organisation also says the industry is facing serious challenges adapting to new emissions legislation.\n\nIt says new rules will require a huge expansion in the use of electric and hybrid cars.\n\nBut according to the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, the fallout from Brexit remains the biggest \"clear and present danger\" to the sector in the UK.\n\n'Perfect storm'\n\nFigures due out later today are expected to show a total of 2.31 million new cars were registered in 2019, down 2% compared to the year before.\n\nSince reaching a record high of 2.69 million vehicles in 2016, the market has been steadily contracting, in response to what Mr Hawes describes as a \"perfect storm\" for the industry.\n\nA key factor has been the collapse in demand for diesel-powered cars, which fell by 22% compared to 2018.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhere once they accounted for half of all new cars sold, now they make up just a quarter of the market.\n\nThe SMMT says uncertainty over future air quality rules, and in particular over potential restrictions on diesel vehicles entering city centres, has left consumers confused.\n\nThat, combined with political uncertainty and a general fall in consumer confidence, has meant many potential buyers have decided to hang on to their old cars rather than investing in in new ones.\n\n\"You can never put it down to one single factor. It has been a perfect storm over the past few years\", says Mr Hawes.\n\n\"It's really no surprise the market has been declining. That's why we need a return of confidence and strong economic conditions\".\n\nThe situation is not expected to improve this year, however, with the SMMT forecasting a further 1.6 % fall in registrations in 2020.\n\nElectric and hybrid cars\n\nOne area in which sales have increased dramatically over the past year is the market for 'alternatively fuelled vehicles', in other words electric cars and hybrids. They rose by more than a fifth. Registrations of pure-electric cars were up 144%, albeit from a very low level.\n\nThe problem for the industry is that this increase is not happening nearly fast enough. New EU rules which are being phased in this year, and which enter fully into force in 2021, oblige manufacturers to cut the average CO2 emissions of their new car fleets dramatically - or face swingeing fines.\n\nThese targets are expected to remain in force, even after the UK has left the EU. But they imply a cut of more than a third in overall CO2 output, and the industry believes that meeting them will be extremely challenging.\n\nIn fact, the SMMT calculates that without other changes, the market share of electric vehicles would have to rise from the current 1.6% to 27% - or the combined share of electric vehicles and hybrids would have to increase from 7.4% to 56%.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn reality, manufacturers will not rely solely on selling more low- or zero-emission vehicles in order to meet the targets, they will also be able to withdraw their most-polluting models and sell more efficient petrol and diesel vehicles, for example.\n\nBut sales of electric and hybrid vehicles will still need to rise very substantially, and Mr Hawes insists government must play a role.\n\n\"These are still expensive technologies. They carry a price premium,\" he says.\n\n\"That's why incentives are so significant in determining the uptake.\"\n\nBrexit\n\nBut of all the clouds hanging over the industry, one remains darker than the rest in the eyes of the SMMT: the aftermath of Brexit.\n\nAlthough the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January January, what happens after the transition period remains uncertain.\n\nThe government insists it will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.\n\nBut if that doesn't happen, there remains the possibility that the movement of cars and car parts across the channel could be subject to steep tariffs or disruptive border checks and delays.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"That is probably the clear and present danger,\" says Mr Hawes\n\n\"Yes, we will always sell cars in the UK and buy cars in the UK. Where they come from will be affected by Brexit. How much you pay will be affected by Brexit.\"\n\n\"That is right before us now.\""}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-51003504", "published": "2020-01-06T06:55:15", "title": "Australia fires: Rain brings relief but of huge blazes expected ahead", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Australia's capital Canberra is engulfed in smoke\n\nRain has fallen in fire-ravaged parts of Australia and temperatures have dropped - but officials have warned that blazes will \"take off\" again.\n\nSooty rain fell down the east coast, from Sydney to Melbourne, with \"torrential\" rain reported in some parts of New South Wales (NSW).\n\nBut on Sunday night officials warned temperatures would rise by Thursday.\n\nThey also said huge fires in Victoria and New South Wales could meet to create a larger \"mega blaze\".\n\n\"There is no room for complacency,\" NSW state Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned on Monday morning.\n\n\"This morning it is all about recovery, making sure people who have been displaced have somewhere safe.\"\n\nDespite the respite, haze pollution remained dangerously high.\n\nThe National Gallery of Australia in Canberra was shut on Monday \"to mitigate any risk to the public, staff and works of art on display\".

His successor is expected to be in place before council and mayoral elections at the start of May.\n\nLabour's National Executive Committee, the party's governing body, will meet to determine how the contest will be conducted, the day before Parliament returns from its Christmas recess.\n\nIn order to qualify to take part, candidates need the support of at least 21 MPs, as well as the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions.\n\nOne of the key issues to be decided is the \"cut-off\" period for people who are not currently full members of the party and who want to vote.\n\nUnder the current rules, anyone in this position would have at least two weeks to sign up - but this deadline could be extended.\n\nIf this happens, it is likely to favour candidates such as Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy, who are looking to win back former supporters of the party disillusioned about its direction under Mr Corbyn.\n\nIn contrast, those contenders who appear to be more popular with the current left-wing and pro-Remain membership, such as Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, are likely to benefit from a more restricted timetable.\n\nIf this sounds like a drab technical meeting, don't be foxed. The decisions taken by this group could influence the outcome of the contest.\n\nIf the left-leaning National Executive Committee fears an invasion of the centrists, it could opt to restrict the joining window for registered supporters to a mere porthole, and up the cost even further.\n\nIf, on the other hand, they think more people might join to keep the Corbyn flame burning, they can - if they wish - do the opposite.\n\nNow, all this may sound desperately cynical - but last time around, when Owen Smith unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn, a dispute over the leadership rules ended up in the courts.\n\nThe NEC will also decide the rules around the participation of registered supporters.\n\nSince 2015, non-party members have been able to sign up temporarily at a reduced cost to cast a vote.

However, more people signed up in 2016, with about 120,000 registered supporters ultimately taking part.\n\nThe NEC is an elected body made of up parliamentarians, councillors, trade unionists and constituency party members.\n\nWhile Ms Long-Bailey is entitled to attend as one of three shadow cabinet members, the shadow business secretary is expected to be absent as she is likely to enter the leadership contest herself in the coming days.\n\nLabour will also set the rules for its deputy leadership election, after Tom Watson stood down at last month's general election."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50986015", "published": "2020-01-06T00:01:27", "title": "Harvey Weinstein trial: 'Why I broke my silence'", "text": "Video\n\nJasmine Lobe is a \"silence breaker\", one of the dozens of women who have come forward to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault after allegations about his behaviour became public in 2017.\n\nAhead of the Hollywood producer's trial on criminal charges, she spoke to the BBC's Nick Bryant about what a guilty verdict would mean for alleged survivors.\n\nMr Weinstein is accused of raping one woman in a hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another in his apartment in 2006.

Dad! Assemble!'\n\nThey sat on the sofa, and I walked in and performed Just A Little by Liberty X. We had it on VHS and I stood in front of the TV doing the moves.\n\nAmazing song choice.\n\nMaybe not for a three year old! I remember the night before, I got my mum to cut a hole in my black vest because the girls in the video had leather PVC suits with holes where their cleavage would be. I mean, I didn't have cleavage at three or four, but I wanted to look like them.\n\nSo your first memory is a musical one?\n\nYeah, it's so vivid in my mind. I was so, so concentrated on that performance. I hadn't even practiced it, I was just like, \"This is my time to shine!\"\n\nImage copyright Joy Crookes Image caption The singer has also been nominated for the Brits rising star award\n\nI heard you were quite an entrepreneur as a child, too...\n\nWhere did you find that out?! But, yeah, when I was about nine, I worked out it would cost me \u00a380 to get everyone in my family Christmas presents. So I went to Poundland in Elephant and Castle, and you could buy a box of 10 candy canes for \u00a31. I worked out that if I sold each of them for \u00a31, I could make 900% profit.\n\nI also had a side hustle selling clothes, because that \u00a380 needed to come quick. If someone said, \"That top looks great on you\", I'd say, \"I'll give it to you for a fiver\".\n\nWhen my mates came round to our house, little did they know, it wasn't playtime, it was selling time!\n\nIf music doesn't work out, you can always apply for the Apprentice.\n\nI probably will!\n\nYou grew up listening to music - but was there a point where you thought, \"This is something I can do for a career?\"\n\nI never had that epiphany because I never thought music was a legitimate job. I thought that pop stars were pop stars and that's who they were. I almost didn't see them as human beings until Kate Nash came about.\n\nShe made me realise I could use music as a diary. I was going through a lot at home and I didn't have anyone to talk to, so I just used my guitar. But I didn't really think, \"Oh, I'm a musician now\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The singer-songwriter is self-taught on the guitar, piano and bass\n\nHow did you learn to play?\n\nWith piano, I learnt a couple of chords at school, then I taught myself the songs from the film Once by looking up the chords on YouTube. With guitar it was the same: I learnt two chords from a family friend, then I went home and learned a lot of Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber songs because, no offence, I thought they'd be easy.\n\nI used to have a cupboard that had a mirror on it, so I'd sit down and watch myself playing guitar. That's really good when you're learning, because you can watch where your hands are going.\n\nSo that was my mentality, and then I started writing after that.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nMy mum's friend had a son who was my age who played the most incredible Brazilian guitar. I loved Astrud Gilberto, so I asked him round to mine and I said, \"Do you know this song Hit The Road Jack? I think we should cover it\".\n\nSo we recorded it on iMovie, put it on YouTube and it got 500,000 views - which was mad.\n\nThings really exploded in 2017 when you played Mother May I Sleep With Danger on the YouTube channel Colors. The video's now been watched 8 million times. Did it change your career?\n\nThat song was never meant to be a single. I wrote it on my own, at the piano, on the first of January 2017. But the Colors performance made more sense than the record, because I'd been playing the song on tour. When you tour a song you get to know it - you stay over at its house, you meet its mum, you get to know the sibling it doesn't like. So by the time we did Colors, it was a walk in the park.\n\nThat performance was our third take and I remember I pretended my mum was right there and I was singing it to her.\n\nThe video really changed everything. For about six months after that, everywhere I went people would say, \"Are you Joy from Colors?\"\n\nYou thought music wasn't a viable career, so did that video force you to rewrite the story in your head?\n\nIt definitely started kicking in there. We'd gone to Germany [to make the video] and I was like, 'What do you mean I'm flying to Berlin for work, to sing songs?'\n\nBut even after that, I went for a job interview as a waitress at a Kurdish restaurant.\n\nDid you get the job?\n\nNo! As soon as I went for the interview, I regretted it. The manager was looking at me like, \"What do you mean, you can't work on most days?\"\n\nSeveral of your songs, like For A Minute and London Mine, are love letters to London. Why does it inspire you so much?\n\nThe beauty of London is that it wouldn't be London without all the immigration, and the mix of cultures and colours and the smells and the stories it contains.\n\nI grew up on a street where my neighbours are Bajan and the neighbours after that are Bengali and the neighbours after that are from Nigeria. I learned so many mannerisms and different forms of respect and stories and myths and legends from all these places. I wouldn't be the person I am without London. It inspires me to be a certain kind of woman, and a certain kind of person.\n\nImage copyright Joy Crookes Image caption Crookes is currently recording her debut album, with a self-imposed deadline of May 2020\n\nAmerican musicians often eulogise their hometowns, but it's not so common in the UK. Why is that?\n\nI love my area, and London as a whole, so I think I should sing about it and celebrate it.\n\nBut when I write about London, it's also a response to the austerity of the last 10 years. For A Minute is about growing up in an area that may not be rich or vibrant, but making the most out of things like having \u00a32 to go to the chicken shop after school. There's a lyric, \"eating sunshine every day\", that's a comment on poverty.\n\nThen I also talk about \"creamy legs in London air\" because when I was growing up all the girls from secondary school, who are mainly black and brown, would have the most moisturised legs you've ever seen in your life.\n\nSo I try and have a positive message: \"Hey, this is the sick stuff about London. If we all packed up and left, and went back to India, Yorkshire or wherever, you wouldn't know what to do. It wouldn't be London any more.\"\n\nThere's a fearlessness in the way you talk about relationships, too. I love that line in Man's World - \"I find my love in red wine\".\n\nI was very angry when I wrote that! I'm saying I find my love in something that's an object, as opposed to you. You are less important to me than a drink.\n\nAt least alcohol's always there when you need it.\n\nExactly. That's probably a very Irish message!\n\nOn a more serious note, you've been playing a new song recently that addresses your mental health...\n\nYeah, it's called Anyone But Me. The first line is, \"Seven years strong with my therapy, making mosaics of my memories,\" so there's no mucking around. It's literally like, this is how I feel: I feel like there's another person living in my head.\n\nIt's something I've battled with for a long time. I remember when I was 12, I rang up the NHS and said, \"I can't get out of bed. I'm not ill, I haven't got a cold, I just can't get out of bed\". And the guy on the other end of the phone said, \"Ah, have you heard of depression?\"\n\nHave you spoken to your therapist about how the music industry could affect your health?\n\nNo, I haven't been able to see him because I haven't had time - which is not good. And I'm kind of struggling with that now. The first album just makes me want to crap myself. I'm like, \"Why am I stressed every day, I should be excited about this? But why should I be excited when this is nerve-wracking?\"\n\nI'm massively over-thinking everything.

However, the ABVP said that its members had been attacked by left-wing groups, and some had been injured.\n\nThe cause of the attack is still unclear. There were violent clashes at JNU last year over a rise in hostel fees.\n\nThe university initially released a statement informing students that \"armed miscreants\" were \"roaming around, damaging property and attacking people\".\n\nIt later released another statement in which it blamed a \"group of students\" who were opposing an ongoing admission process to register new students. It is widely believed that the statement referred to leftist students who have been protesting against the hostel fee hike for the past three months.\n\nThe university also recently saw protests over a controversial citizenship law.\n\nStudents at the university said they would take out rallies against the violence on Monday. A group of them also protested against police \"inaction\", alleging that it took them hours to get to the campus.\n\nThe atmosphere around the campus is still tense, reports the BBC's Vikas Pandey who is at JNU.\n\n\"Students are really worried about their future. They fear more attacks. The fear is such that many of them refused to talk on camera, fearing reprisals.

Since then, it has honed the tech on the streets of Moscow and Tel Aviv.\n\nYandex's fleet has clocked 1.5 million miles (2.4 million km) of autonomous driving so far. That puts it behind the likes of Google's Waymo, which had achieved more than 10 million as of July 2019.\n\n\"The robot drivers which we are developing, they cannot get distracted,\" Yulia Shveyko, head of media relations for Yandex driverless cars, tells me.\n\nThe fleet is already used by Yandex's rideshare service in Moscow.\n\n\"So we have passengers who are using our app to order rides. They're going to the university, post office, grocery store, and it's completely integrated into their typical routines,\" she adds.\n\n\"And what we've seen is that within a very quick time period, once they feel safe it starts to feel very normal.\"\n\nI can't vouch for this of course - except to say next time I am in Moscow, I will try to rock up at a supermarket in a driverless car and see if anybody bats an eyelid.\n\n'Exhilarating at first'\n\nI have to admit that after an exhilarating first few minutes, it all felt pretty normal to me too.\n\nLater, I decided to take a second driverless ride - this time from rideshare service Lyft, which is offering driverless journeys around Las Vegas in its fleet of adapted BMWs during CES.\n\nMy colleague Cody and I didn't tell them we were journalists, mainly because we couldn't get a word in edgeways, but this was a far more cautious journey.\n\nThere were two humans in the front - a driver and a man called Dan who seemed to be a kind of tour guide. The vehicle was actually in manual mode much of the time. Not all of the hotels have agreed to this tech being used on their private property, so getting on and off the strip required human effort.\n\nIf you want an opinion about anything, ask a cabbie.

Here, one former abattoir worker describes her job, and the effect it had on her mental health.\n\nWarning: Some readers may find this story disturbing\n\nWhen I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.\n\nIt was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it's not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.\n\nI was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.\n\nWhether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There's animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.\n\nAnd the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.\n\nWhy would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?\n\nFor me, it was because I'd already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.\n\nOn my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I'd get used to it.\n\nSoon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I'm sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You'll know if you've ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.\n\nPersonally, I didn't suffer physical injuries, but the place affected my mind.\n\nAs I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I'd witnessed throughout the day.\n\nOne skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn't just make the job easier - it's necessary for survival.\n\nThere are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.\n\nAt the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.\n\nWhenever I walked past that skip, I couldn't help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I'd participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.\n\nI know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I'll never forget the day, after I'd been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.\n\nI took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, \"It's just not right, it's not right,\" over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.\n\nEven worse than pregnant cows, though, were the young calves we sometimes had to kill.\n\nA physically demanding role\n\nOn its website, the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) says the UK meat industry has some of the highest standards of hygiene and welfare in the world.\n\nMany of its members, it says, \"are at the forefront of abattoir design with facilities designed to house the animals and help them move around the site with ease and without any pain, distress or suffering\".\n\nMeat processing in the UK employs about 75,000 people of whom approximately 69% are from other European Union member states, the BMPA notes.\n\n\"The barrier to British people taking up roles in meat processing is an unwillingness to work in what is perceived to be a challenging environment,\" it says. \"Most people, while they eat meat, find it difficult to work in its production partly because of the obvious aversion to the slaughter process but also because it is a physically demanding role.\"\n\nAt the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I'd been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.\n\nWe tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.\n\nWhen the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne. When we put the first calf in, it only came about a quarter of a way up the box, if that. We put all five calves in at once. Then we killed them.\n\nAfterwards, looking at the dead animals on the ground, the slaughterers were visibly upset.\n\nI rarely saw them so vulnerable. Emotions in the abattoir tended to be bottled up. Nobody talked about their feelings; there was an overwhelming sense that you weren't allowed to show weakness. Plus, there were a lot of workers who wouldn't have been able to talk about their feelings to the rest of us even if they'd wanted to. Many were migrant workers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, whose English wasn't good enough for them to seek help if they were struggling.\n\nA lot of the men I was working with were also moonlighting elsewhere - they'd finish their 10 or 11 hours at the abattoir before going on to another job - and exhaustion often took its toll. Some developed alcohol problems, often coming into work smelling strongly of drink. Others became addicted to energy drinks, and more than one had a heart attack. These drinks were then removed from the abattoir vending machines, but people would still bring them in from home and drink them secretly in their cars.\n\n'I'm an animal lover'\n\nFor The Food Chain, the BBC's Emily Thomas met a slaughterman at Tideford abbattoir, who described his approach to his work:\n\n\"Basically, I'm an animal lover. I don't take any pleasure in what we're doing, but if I can do it as quietly and professionally as possible, then I think we've achieved something. Just be professional, do it, then switch off - and then, when we've finished work, go home and be a normal person. It's not for everybody. I know a couple of butchers that would not walk inside this abattoir; the thought of taking something's life, they find that difficult to accept, or witness.\"\n\nListen to The Food Chain: Inside the Abbattoir\n\nAbattoir work has been linked to multiple mental health problems - one researcher uses the term \"Perpetrator-Induced Traumatic Syndrome\" to refer to symptoms of PTSD suffered by slaughterhouse workers. I personally suffered from depression, a condition exacerbated by the long hours, the relentless work, and being surrounded by death. After a while, I started feeling suicidal.\n\nIt's unclear whether slaughterhouse work causes these problems, or whether the job attracts people with pre-existing conditions. But either way, it's an incredibly isolating job, and it's hard to seek help. When I'd tell people what I did for work, I'd either be met with absolute revulsion, or a curious, jokey fascination. Either way, I could never open up to people about the effect it was having on me. Instead I sometimes joked along with them, telling gory tales about skinning a cow or handling its innards. But mostly I just kept quiet.\n\nA few years into my time at the abattoir, a colleague started making flippant comments about \"not being here in six months\". Everyone would laugh it off. He was a bit of a joker, so people assumed he was taking the mick, saying he'd have a new job or something. But it made me feel really uneasy. I took him into a side room and asked him what he meant, and he broke down. He admitted that he was plagued by suicidal thoughts, that he didn't feel like he could cope any more, and that he needed help - but he begged me not to tell our bosses.\n\nI was able to help him get treatment from his GP - and in helping him, I realised I needed to help myself too. I felt like the horrific things I was seeing had clouded my thinking, and I was in a full-blown state of depression. It felt like a big step, but I needed to get out of there.\n\nAfter I left my job at the abattoir, things started looking brighter. I changed tack completely and began working with mental health charities, encouraging people to open up about their feelings and seek professional help - even if they don't think they need it, or feel like they don't deserve it.\n\nA few months after leaving, I heard from one of my former colleagues. He told me that a man who'd worked with us, whose job was to flay the carcasses, had killed himself.\n\nSometimes I recall my days at the slaughterhouse. I think about my former colleagues working relentlessly, as though they were treading water in a vast ocean, with dry land completely out of sight. I remember my colleagues who didn't survive.\n\nAnd at night, when I close my eyes and try to sleep, I still sometimes see hundreds of pairs of eyeballs staring back at me.\n\nAs told to Ashitha Nagesh\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nTwenty million chickens are killed each week to feed consumers in the UK.

This week we speak to Mette Lykke, co-founder of fitness tracker Endomondo, and chief executive of food waste app, Too Good To Go.\n\nFor many people, leaving the stability of a well-paid job to start your own business might seem daunting. For Danish entrepreneur Mette Lykke, it's a leap she's made not just once, but twice.\n\nBack in 2007 she was working for management consultancy firm McKinsey, but decided it was time to change direction. \"I was missing the feeling of having a real impact,\" she says.\n\nIn a serendipitous twist she was in New York when a stranger came over and handed her a postcard. It read: \"Whatever our wildest dreams may be, they only scratch the surface of what's possible.\"\n\n\"It was just a nice sign,\" the 38-year-old recalls. \"She gave it to me when I was waiting at a red light, and she just walked away.\"\n\nMette decided to go for it and partnered with fellow Danes and McKinsey colleagues, Christian Birk and \u00adJakob Jonck, to launch the personal training app Endomondo.\n\n\"I might have done it anyway,\" she says. \"But it definitely didn't feel like a coincidence at that time.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fitness app Endomondo was sold to Under Armour for $85m\n\nMette was a competitive horse-rider and for the three sports enthusiasts, launching an app to \"make fitness fun\" was a logical fit. Making a success of their Copenhagen-based idea was no walk in the park though.\n\nAt that time - 13 years ago - most phones lacked GPS. In the first few months of Endomondo there were days when no one signed up at all. \"It really felt a little bit uphill,\" she says.\n\nMette says that her upbringing helped prepare her for the hard graft. She grew up alongside her family's timber business in Ringkobing, a small town in Jutland in western Denmark. \"I grew up seeing that there are ups and downs,\" she says.\n\n\"Most days are just hard work, [but] if I had known back then that I wouldn't see any salary for the next two years, I might have reconsidered,\" she laughs. \"You just don't know.\"\n\nAs an entrepreneur, \"you're definitely an optimist,\" she explains. \"We always thought next month is going to be different.\"\n\nThe game-changer came when the Apple App Store opened in 2008 and smart phone sales boomed. But it still took Endomondo six years to make its first profit.\n\nImage copyright Too Good To Go Image caption Too Good To Go says it now has more than 18 million users\n\nBy 2015, the app had 20 million users and caught the attention of American sportswear giant, Under Armour.\n\n\"They were particularly interested in increasing brand awareness in Europe,\" says Mette. \"We could help with that, with the vast majority of [our] users being based here.\"\n\nThe US company bought Endomondo for $85m (\u00a365m). Mette was just 33 at the time, and she and her two co-founders were suddenly multimillionaires.\n\n\"It's a strange thing to sell a business you were part of creating,\" she says. \"While the deal was a big success from a business perspective and I was happy with the decision, it was still hard to let go of my baby on a personal level.\"\n\nAfter the sale she continued to work for Endomondo and its new parent, managing teams both in Copenhagen where she was based and also in Texas.\n\nIt was following a chance encounter on a bus outside Copenhagen in August 2016 that the Dane embarked on her next mission - fighting food waste. She started chatting to a fellow passenger who showed her an app called Too Good To Go.\n\n\"I was not fully aware of how big of an issue in society food waste really is,\" recalls Mette. After doing more research she was shocked to learn about its climate impact. \"That was mind-blowing to me.\"\n\nImage copyright Too Good To Go Image caption Mette now employs 450 people at Too Good To Go\n\nFive young Danish entrepreneurs had launched the online marketplace several months earlier. Restaurants and shops post what leftover food they have available, together with a time-slot for collection.\n\nMembers of the public can then purchase discounted meals or groceries through the app. The surplus food is saved from being thrown away - the firm makes money by taking a cut on meals sold.\n\n\"The fact that we can help solve such a massive issue and then leave everyone as winners in the process, I thought that was really powerful,\" says Mette.\n\nShe found the start-up \"so exciting\" that she invested. Several months later she left Under Armour and joined Too Good To Go as chief executive. \"I wouldn't have jumped into this if I didn't think I could contribute,\" she says.\n\nAccording to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, one-third of the world's food is wasted. When ranked alongside countries, food waste is the world's third-largest producer of carbon dioxide after the USA and China.\n\nIn recent years dozens of firms have set out to tackle this, including similar platforms like Olio, Foodcloud and Karma. Alan Hayes, from food and grocery research group IGD, says these apps have \"helped to raise awareness of food waste in businesses and in schools\" as well as empowering consumers.\n\nWhen it comes to changing behaviour about food waste, Trish Caddy, an analyst at fellow research firm Mintel, thinks consumers respond better to rewards. \"The Too Good to Go app is particularly good at normalising eating leftovers by promoting end-of-day food at a discount,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Too Good To Go Image caption More than 30,000 food firms are signed up\n\nMette has overseen a rapid expansion. The firm now employs 450 people, operates in 13 European countries and is due to roll out in Sweden.\n\n\"Endomondo took three years to get to the first million users and with Too Good To Go it took 15 months,\" she says. \"It's just a completely different time\u2026 the technology is ready.\"\n\nMette says it is one of Europe's fastest-growing apps with 18 million users and is gaining an additional 45,000 daily. Customers range from bargain-hunting students to environmentally-conscious young families, while women over 50 are another big market. It has also partnered with more than 30,000 food suppliers, from Yo Sushi to Accor Hotels.\n\nMore The Boss features:\n\nMette describes it as a \"social impact\" company. \"Every time we make a euro in revenue, it's because we did something good.\"\n\nIt aims to ultimately be profit making, though Mette says the timeline for delivering returns isn't yet clear. \"At the moment, every revenue we make goes back into the business. Just growing it and expanding it to more and more countries. That's our focus.\"\n\nSo far the Too Good To Go team reckon they have helped save more than 25 million meals.\n\n\"I feel like this is just the beginning,\" says Mette. \"It doesn't feel like we're anywhere near the goal line at all. Within the next five years, we want to have saved a billion meals.\""}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51003084", "published": "2020-01-06T00:41:10", "title": "CES 2020: Restaurant cat robot meows at dining customers", "text": "Image copyright PuduTech Image caption BellaBot is a waiter with attitude\n\nA robot cat designed to ferry plates of food to restaurant customers has been unveiled at the CES tech expo in Las Vegas.\n\nBellaBot, built by the Chinese firm PuduTech, is one of a number of wacky robotic inventions being shown off at the event this year.\n\nThere is also UBTech's Walker, which can pull yoga poses.\n\nAnd Charmin's RollBot.

So, did the Bush camp solicit foreign interference to help him win an election - the allegation that has seen President Trump impeached?\n\n\"A guy like that doesn't deserve to be president,\" President Bush told his sister about Clinton.\n\nHe viewed the young Arkansas governor, who was the same age as Bush's eldest son, as a scoundrel and felt confident he could roll over him.\n\nBut the president sorely underestimated a political thaumaturge, so gifted that his ascent to the White House had been foreseen when he was aged just seven by his school teacher.\n\nTo Bush's mystification, his saxophone-tootling challenger's popularity in opinion polls was even defying the gravity of revelations about his draft-dodging past.\n\nThe Republican, a decorated World War 2 fighter pilot, dictated to his diary: \"I'm tired of this guy lying and ducking on the draft and not coming clean.\"\n\nBush had another problem - his campaign was as stale as the recession-sapped US economy.\n\nSo he turned for inspiration across the Atlantic to his friend, UK Prime Minister John Major.\n\nThe British premier's come-from-behind general election win in April 1992 was being touted by American conservatives as a blueprint for the US president.\n\nBush had a very special relationship with Major, his brother-in-arms from the 1990-91 Gulf War, as has previously been revealed in transcripts of their private conversations obtained by the BBC.\n\nHe once spoke of sending him \"a love letter\" and assured the British PM \"obviously we're rooting for you\" to beat Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nMajor, critics suspected, returned the favour.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTwo UK Tory panjandrums - architects of the PM's surprise victory - flew to Washington eight weeks before the US election and advised the Bush team to focus attacks on Clinton's character.\n\nThe president's campaign hired an opposition research specialist to dig for dirt in Britain.\n\nWhat happened next was either a bureaucratic mishap, or an egregious act of political meddling by the UK in the internal politics of a friendly nation.\n\nAt some point in early October 1992, the Home Office inspected its immigration nationality section to see whether Clinton had applied for British citizenship while at Oxford University from 1968-70 in order to escape the Vietnam draft.\n\nBriefing reporters on background, the department said its \"comprehensive\" check was conducted out of \"sheer helpfulness\" to the media, even though it usually always rebuffed journalists with the stock answer that it did not discuss individual cases.\n\nNothing compromising on the Democrat was discovered, though it remains an open question how any such political bombshell, had it been excavated, would have been handled by Whitehall.\n\nThat same month, a frustrated Bush would dictate to his diary that \"we cannot get this smoking gun on Clinton\".\n\nMore on US presidents\n\nAll Major could offer him were well wishes.\n\nThe British premier called Bush on Air Force One during a last burst of campaigning two days ahead of November's election.\n\n\"I wanted to wish you a great hurrah and all of my best for the home stretch,\" Major said, according to a transcript of their conversation at the Bush presidential library in Texas.\n\nBut he had backed the wrong horse - Clinton trounced Bush.\n\nReturning to the White House a day after he lost, the humiliated one-term president grew emotional, according to biographer Jon Meacham.\n\nBush dictated to his diary that he was thinking to himself: \"How in God's name did this country elect a draft dodger?\"\n\nA month later, when the Home Office publicly acknowledged having carried out the file check, the victorious Clinton did not hide his annoyance.\n\n\"They should have more pressing business,\" he said of British officials when asked about the controversy during a morning jog in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThat very same day, 6 December 1992, Major wrote a letter of apology to the US president-elect.\n\nAccording to a copy of the correspondence, declassified only last year by the UK National Archives, the British premier said he was \"disturbed by reports which have appeared about enquiries by our Home Office relating back to your time at Oxford\".\n\n\"I am only sorry,\" Major added, \"that it has been played up now in a mischievous way. I hope the mischief will be short-lived.\"\n\nThe file does not indicate that Clinton responded.\n\nLater that month, Major flew to Washington on an official working visit. He had hoped to mend fences with the president-elect during the trip.\n\nBut Clinton declined to meet him - the Washington Post described it as a snub.\n\nWith the so-called special relationship on ice, Labour MPs jeered the prime minister in the House of Commons in February 1993 as he denied taking sides in a US election.\n\nMargaret Beckett, the opposition's deputy leader, was among members of Parliament who shook her head sceptically at Major's explanation.\n\n\"No I didn't buy it,\" the MP for Derby South tells the BBC, remembering that day in the chamber 27 years ago.\n\n\"I thought at the very least there must have been a nod and wink [between the US and UK].\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bush and Clinton - pictured with Major (L) at Russian leader Boris Yeltsin's 2007 funeral - struck up a friendship after leaving office\n\n\"And probably a bit more than a nod and a wink, 'if you can find something, George [HW Bush] might be rather grateful'.\n\n\"Because it [the Home Office records search] seemed to me like the kind of thing most civil servants would be fairly wary about doing.\"\n\nWhosever idea it was, Beckett says, it was \"quite a big mistake\".\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Major - now a knight of the realm - denied approving the Home Office file search.\n\nHis spokeswoman, Dame Arabella Warburton, says: \"Sir John did, indeed, have a close working and personal relationship with President George HW Bush.\n\n\"However, Sir John neither sanctioned, nor had any knowledge of, Home Office checks being carried out on George Bush's Presidential rival Bill Clinton.\"\n\nNo-one in the Bush camp set any UK official to go rummaging for such skeletons in Clinton's closet, insists Charles Black, who was a senior adviser to the president's re-election bid.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident that nobody in the campaign asked for it,\" he tells the BBC.\n\n\"It didn't come up in the meetings I had with the [UK] Conservatives, so maybe somebody in the [US] government did.\"\n\nThe two top Tory apparatchiks who flew to Washington were Sir John Lacy and Mark Fullbrook. Lacy died in 2009 and Fullbrook declined to comment to the BBC.\n\nJames Pinkerton, who was deputy assistant to Bush and worked on the campaign, thinks his former boss' hands were clean.\n\n\"Bush was an ethical, honest guy,\" he tells the BBC, \"and if you said to him, we're going to do a dirty trick to help you win, he would've said, no.\"\n\nBut despite his reputation for civility and decency, \"the last gentleman\" - as Bush's admirers call him - did not always measure up to the ideal of noblesse oblige.\n\nIn his political life, he was fully prepared to fight dirty to win, as evidenced by the infamously race-baiting attacks he launched in 1988 to tar his then-Democratic challenger, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, as soft on crime.\n\nBush effectively blamed his rival for the torture and rape of a white couple by a black felon, Willie Horton, who had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on a weekend-release programme.\n\nAnd as Ronald Reagan's deputy, Bush blatantly lied when insisting he was \"out of the loop\" on the administration's secret effort to trade arms with Iran for hostages in violation of its own policy.\n\n\"I'm one of the few people who know the details,\" the vice-president had confided to his diary.\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush - who died one year ago, aged 94 - was an intensely competitive man.\n\nIn 1980, as his dream of capturing the Republican presidential nomination began to slip away in the wake of defeat to Reagan in New Hampshire, Bush penned a revealing note to himself on a flight.\n\n\"I WILL NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER. NEVER,\" it said in bold scrawl. He gave up three months later.\n\nSidney Blumenthal, a historian and former Clinton White House aide, tells the BBC that \"of course\" the Home Office files search was done at the behest of the British government in cahoots with team Bush.\n\nHe notes that former Bush chief of staff James Baker - who declined to speak to the BBC for this article - stated in a 1992 memo, cited recently by the New York Times, that the commander-in-chief would not have enlisted the UK to aid his campaign.\n\n\"And yet somehow the Home Office went ahead,\" Blumenthal archly adds. \"Hard to believe that they [the British government] would do this entirely unbidden.\"\n\nThe UK action might be dismissed as the suspected rogue meddling of an over-zealous ally, except that it was mirrored by a simultaneous muck-raking exercise within the Bush administration.\n\nJust as the Republican president was making an issue of his rival's past opposition to the Vietnam War, a government warehouse in suburban Maryland was being scoured for damaging information on Clinton, and even his mother.\n\nThis scandal came to be known as Passportgate.\n\nA stinging Department of State inspector general report would later implicate two Bush political appointees in having Clinton's documents unsealed. It was a fruitless bid to find out if the Democrat had ever considered renouncing his US citizenship during the Vietnam conflict.\n\nWhile the watchdog did not establish the White House had directly instigated the invasion of privacy, it found Baker was aware of the \"heinous activity\", yet did nothing to stop it.\n\nBaker was cleared three years later of any \"criminal intent\" in the matter by an independent counsel investigation set up under then-and-current US Attorney General William Barr.\n\nBeyond the suspicions, no concrete proof has emerged of collusion between Bush and Major in the US election of '92.\n\nBut even if there was, isn't what President Trump allegedly did - brazenly soliciting the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to harm the election prospects of his potential White House challenger, Joe Biden - worse?\n\nNot under US campaign finance law, according to Ann Ravel, former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIt is illegal for anyone to seek or accept anything of value from a foreign national in an American election, she points out.\n\nMs Ravel, who led the federal regulator in 2015, tells the BBC: \"It would be the equivalent of what we're seeing now [with Trump] because obviously it would be a request by the Bush White House for what is something of value to the campaign.\"\n\nThough so much about the Trump presidency is said to be unprecedented, foreign interference in elections - with the occasional connivance of unscrupulous US office-seekers - is as old as the American republic itself.\n\nAs he pursued his own political ambitions, Founding Father Thomas Jefferson enabled outrageous French meddling in US internal affairs.\n\nWhen President George Washington infuriated Paris by forging a peace treaty with Great Britain in 1794, Jefferson briefed against his commander-in-chief to the French ambassador, who was trying to wreck the accord.\n\nAs vice-president to John Adams in 1797, Jefferson was suspected of treason when he undercut his boss by sabotaging Franco-American peace talks, again via diplomatic back channels.\n\nHow prescient that a decade earlier Adams had written to a friend in France: \"As often as Elections happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.\"\n\nThat letter was addressed to Jefferson.\n\nFollow @judesheerin\n\nMore on US presidents\n\n."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50716694", "published": "2020-01-06T00:54:24", "title": "Pakistan forgiveness laws: The price of getting away with murder", "text": "The murder was so brutal it shocked even the hardened detectives who arrived at the scene on the outskirts of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad.

In reality, legal observers agree that the primary motive for that \"forgiveness\" is normally financial, and the informal payment of money to victims is not illegal.\n\nImage caption Mohammad Zakaria believes his brother-in-law became more violent after the first incidents\n\nThe provisions allowing crimes of bodily harm to be \"settled\" or \"forgiven\" were introduced in the 1990s as part of a set of Islamic-inspired legal reforms.\n\nSupporters of the system say it helps reduce pressure on Pakistan's already overburdened and delay-ridden court system, and reduces the likelihood of feuds developing. But according to one study, the murder conviction rate in the country dropped from 29% in 1990, before the laws were introduced, to just 12% in 2000.\n\nCritics argue the law can give repeat offenders a sense of impunity, and is a tool for the more powerful to evade justice. Bushra Iftikhar's brother believes the fact her killer was never punished in any of his previous cases only made him grow more violent.\n\n\"He became arrogant. He thought: 'I did this, and nothing happened. Now I'm free and the law can't touch me.'\"\n\nSami Ullah's family admit the previous cases had ended in what are often termed \"compromises\", but insist they had agreed them to avoid a drawn-out legal process, not because Sami Ullah was guilty. Sami Ullah is currently appealing against a death sentence after being convicted of murder.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Many cases never even make it to court (pictured: the Supreme Court in Islamabad)\n\nAshtar Ausaf Ali, who served as attorney general under the previous government, put forward plans to reform the laws in 2015 whilst still retaining the element of forgiveness.\n\n\"A person has the right to forgive,\" he told the BBC from his office in the city of Lahore, but he added that crime wasn't just a matter for an individual, but for society.\n\nHis idea was to introduce mandatory minimum sentences, so that \"people would know that they cannot put a price tag on a crime\".\n\nDespite being supported by some clerics, Mr Ali's proposals were blocked by a number of Islamist politicians. At the moment, there seems little prospect of them being resurrected.\n\nUndermining the system\n\nThe current law is a source of frustration at times for both police officers and criminal prosecutors. Courts do have the right to reject settlements if they believe they are coerced, but most observers agree that due to the number of cases in the court system, they rarely investigate thoroughly.\n\nMeanwhile, one detective told me he had come across dozens of examples of offenders reaching a settlement with their alleged victims only to go on to reoffend. He said the police would spend time and resources investigating a crime only for the case to end abruptly.\n\nThen there are other times, when the police themselves can be the beneficiaries of such \"settlements\".\n\nImage copyright Handout Image caption Salahuddin Ayubi died after being arrested\n\nIn August, CCTV images of a thief sticking his tongue out at the camera as he stole a bank card from a cash machine in the central Pakistani city of Faisalabad went viral on social media.\n\nBut the case took a grim turn as shortly after Salahuddin Ayubi was arrested by police, he died in custody.\n\nThe compromise\n\nSuspicions mounted after another video emerged of Salahuddin Ayubi, who apparently initially pretended to police that he was deaf and mute, writhing in pain as a policeman twisted his arms behind his back while another interrogated him.\n\nSalahuddin's father, Muhammad Afzal, initially pressed for justice for his son, who is believed to have suffered from a mental illness. However, a month later, he announced he was forgiving the policemen accused of killing him \"in the name of God\".\n\nThe \"settlement\" or \"compromise\" in that case is understood to have consisted of an agreement the authorities would build a new 8km (five-mile) road in the family's village, as well as a new gas pipeline, not to mention the payment of an undisclosed sum of money.\n\nSalahuddin's father seemed content with the deal, which was brokered by a radical cleric with links to the intelligence services. But others, who don't have powerful backers or the weight of public pressure behind them, often end up feeling as if they have no choice but to agree with what is being offered to them.\n\nIn a village outside Lahore, I met the family of another man who died in police custody. He had been detained after wrongly being accused of murder.\n\nThe BBC is not revealing the family's names in order to protect them from repercussions, but they say a mixture of coercion and money led them to drop the case against the police officers they hold responsible for his death.\n\n\"We haven't forgiven them in our hearts,\" the victim's brother told me. \"We never will, but we were helpless.\"\n\nHe said a steady stream of local politicians and influential figures had arrived on his doorstep when they began to fight for justice.\n\n\"They would say: 'Do a deal. If you don't, you won't be able to do anything anyway. Maybe they'll go to jail for six months or a year, after that they'll be freed and can make all sorts of trouble for you.'\"\n\nThe family are poor and were offered enough money to buy a house, something they would have struggled ever to do otherwise. They accepted, but the mother remained distraught at the bargain she felt forced to make.\n\n\"I wish to God that we were still living in a rented house, and my son was still alive,\" she said. \"They took my son and gave me money for a house, what kind of deal is that?\"\n\nIllustration by Nick Galvin"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50951043", "published": "2020-01-03T15:19:10", "title": "Australia fires: A visual guide to the bushfire crisis", "text": "Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.\n\nThe fires, burning since September, have intensified over the past week, with a number towns evacuated.

Parks, trails and camping grounds have been closed and holidaymakers have been told to urgently leave a 260km (160-mile) stretch of NSW coast before Saturday, 4 January, when extreme conditions are forecast.\n\nOther states are also suffering\n\nIn Victoria, more than 800,000 hectares have been burned.

Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.\n\nData shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.\n\nAustralia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C.\n\nBy the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.\n\nA climate phenomenon is causing the heatwave\n\nThe main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.\n\nThe difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years.\n\nAs a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia.\n\nAndrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.\n\n\"The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,\" he says.\n\n\"A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country.\"\n\nAnd meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50987303", "published": "2020-01-05T00:47:47", "title": "Why fewer US students want to learn about UK these days", "text": "Image copyright Paul Grundy/DCMS\n\nOnce a bastion of English and History departments, the British studies discipline is waning as American students increasingly put career goals over their love of Charles Dickens, writes James Jeffrey.\n\nIt's Friday afternoon at the University of Texas at Austin, which means it's time for sherry and a weekly lecture on British studies.

A few undergraduate and graduate students are dotted around but they are definitely in the minority.\n\nBritish studies is up against shifting trends in American universities as history and English departments focus less on Western Europe and more on other parts of the world.\n\nAmerica quit being a British colony almost 250 years ago but until recently the UK loomed large culturally.\n\n\"As a field, British Studies was inflated in relation to other parts of the world during the 20th Century,\" says Jason Kelly, director of the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Arts and Humanities Institute.\n\n\"Folks have become more concerned about other places and interests around the globe, which I have to say is increasingly productive for thinking about the world, and more in tune with the challenges we face as a global community.\"\n\nImage copyright - Image caption In 1946 Churchill coined the term \"special relationship\"\n\nThis has led to a dramatic decline in the number of British studies courses over the past few decades.\n\nAt the same time, enrolment in undergraduate British history courses has declined \"precipitately\", according to a report by the North American Conference on British Studies (NACBS).\n\nNowadays, the report laments, the discipline is considered by many \"to be old-fashioned, hide bound, conservative and boring - a discipline of old men in tweed coats who still hanker after the stuffy and sexist atmosphere of the senior common room.\"\n\nThose within British studies, however, note the decreasing numbers reflect a wider trend within the humanities as it struggles in the face of changing expectations among students. Since the late 1990s the number of English degrees has fallen by nearly half, according to the US Department of Education. History in general is down about 45% from its 2007 peak.\n\n\"The cost of college is exploding, there's this complete inflation in US higher education,\" says Professor James Vaughn, a historian specialising in Britain at Ohio University.\n\n\"If one has to attend for four years at great cost, you want some remuneration, so the STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] subjects are seen as having massive pay-offs compared to the humanities and the social sciences.\"\n\nThis has been compounded since the financial crash of 2008, with students increasingly fearful that a humanities degree won't lead to gainful employment, says Paul Halliday, president of NACBS.\n\nNevertheless, all may not be lost for British studies.\n\n\"As the balloon of British studies has deflated, we've seen it redefining itself in terms of what it means and does,\" Kelly says. \"What we have been seeing, especially in the last decade, is British studies reorienting itself to increasingly focus on the British Empire and its lasting impact and influence around the world.\"\n\nImage copyright James Jeffrey Image caption British studies, along with other humanities, is losing students in the US\n\nThis is particularly relevant for those wanting to better understand how the US got to where it has, especially on the global stage.\n\n\"Our laws and national institutions, but also character, are so shaped by being part of the British Empire and breaking away from it,\" says Erika Rappaport, the American author of A Thirst for Empire: How Tea Shaped the Modern World.\n\n\"We can't understand the history of US global influence without understanding that Great Britain laid the groundwork, infrastructure and ideologies of globalisation while building and losing their empire in the 19th and 20th Centuries.\"\n\nRappaport became interested in British history and empire studies through a love of reading Victorian literature as a teenager that left her \"dying to find out more about the culture that produced such amazing literature\".\n\nShe says the history of the US being a former colony of the UK has created \"a love-hate relationship\".\n\n\"We share so much in terms of our consumer culture and education, but at times our tastes are very different,\" says Rappaport, citing how the US fondness for coffee stemmed from Americans turning away from British food stuffs - such as tea - because these reminded them of their colonial status.\n\nThe UT Austin British Studies programme - it is not a degree in itself - began in 1975 based on weekly lectures about English literature, history and government.\n\nSince then it has hosted many eminent speakers - CP Snow, the British novelist and scientist, spoke in 1976 on Elite Education in England; Iris Murdoch in 1985 spoke on Themes in English Literature and Philosophy; and the historian Michael Howard spoke in 1993 on Strategic Deception in the Second World War.\n\nImage copyright James Jeffrey Image caption The British Studies programme at the University of Texas at Austin has adopted a stuffed lion - the national animal of England - as its unofficial mascot\n\n\"I like the interdisciplinary ethos, how you get to meet people from other departments,\" says 34-year-old Trevor Simmons during a break in the carol singing at the recent British Studies Christmas Party.

Indeed, the Reds had not started a single teenager in any of their previous 10 meetings with Everton in all competitions before today.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe Reds are at Tottenham on Saturday 11 January (17:30 GMT) and the Toffees host Brighton (15:00 GMT) on the same day."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/51000472", "published": "2020-01-05T23:51:27", "title": "Watch Liverpool's Curtis Jones' stunning goal against Everton in the FA Cup third round", "text": "Watch 18-year-old Curtis Jones' spectacular winning goal for Liverpool against Everton in the FA Cup from all the angles.\n\nAvailable to UK users only\n\nWATCH MORE: Highlights: Liverpool 1-0 Everton"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/51000780", "published": "2020-01-05T16:44:16", "title": "England in South Africa: Dom Sibley's 85 not out puts tourists in control", "text": "Dom Sibley (left) and Joe Root put on 116 for the third wicket\n\nSecond Test, Newlands, Cape Town (day three of five): England 269 & 218-4: Sibley 85*, Root 61 South Africa 223: Elgar 88, Van der Dussen 68, Anderson 5-40 England lead by 264 runs Scorecard\n\nDom Sibley made an unbeaten 85 as England took total control of the second Test against South Africa on day three in Cape Town.\n\nThe opener played a fine watchful knock for his maiden Test fifty to help the tourists grind down the Proteas and close on 218-4, a lead of 264 runs.\n\nEngland captain Joe Root hit a fluent 61 before he and nightwatchman Dom Bess fell late on at Newlands.\n\nJames Anderson (5-40) claimed two quick wickets to dismiss the hosts for 223.\n\nIt gave England a first-innings lead of 46 that they turned into a match-winning position with a sensible batting display.\n\nEngland now have two days to force victory and level the four-Test series at 1-1.\n\nPatient Sibley shows the way\n\nSibley had shown glimpses of ability in his five previous Test innings but only had a top score of 29 and needed to secure his long-term spot.\n\nWhile fellow opener Zak Crawley played more positively, but fell for 25 from a loose drive at Kagiso Rabada, Sibley left well outside off stump and waited for South Africa to stray on to his pads.\n\nThe Warwickshire batsman then whipped forcefully through mid-wicket and calmly clipped off his hips, but proved he has more range as he went on, playing a few lovely cover and square drives.\n\nOther prospective solutions at opener have played impressive innings and faded but the patient manner of Sibley's knock is encouraging, not least with Rory Burns now expected to miss March's tour of Sri Lanka with the ankle injury he sustained playing football.\n\nAlthough Joe Denly fell into the trap, hooking Anrich Nortje to fine leg for 33, the second-wicket stand of 73 gave Root a rare platform to come in and busily up the scoring rate.\n\nHe scored all round the wicket to help England inflict the kind of demoralising day on a fielding side they have themselves experienced often recently and appeared set to push on for a century on day four, only to nick one as Dwaine Pretorius found some late movement.\n\nBess made his second duck of the match, gloving Nortje behind from what proved to be the final ball of the day, but protected Ben Stokes from having to bat and England are well-placed to declare whenever they want on day four.\n\nEvergreen Anderson back to best\n\nJames Anderson needs 18 more wickets to become the first pace bowler to take 600 wickets in Tests\n\nFollowing Anderson's below-par performance in defeat at Centurion, his first Test back after a long-standing calf injury, Root said one of Anderson or Stuart Broad could be dropped for this match - before Jofra Archer was ruled out injured.\n\nBoth the retained seamers impressed on day two and Anderson was back to his ruthless best on the third morning to ensure South Africa's tail barely added to the hosts' overnight total.\n\nHe removed Rabada caught behind for a duck with the first ball of the day before Nortje fell to another fine catch by Stokes at second slip - the first time an England non-keeping fielder has taken five catches in a Test innings.\n\nAnderson, 37, now has 28 five-wickets hauls in Tests and has taken 102 wickets in 26 matches at a staggering average of 20.67 since his 35th birthday.\n\nAny significant injury, like the one that kept him out of the majority of the summer's Ashes series, will invite questions about the future of England's all-time highest Test wicket-taker.\n\nBut if he can return at this level and remain such a threat, England may enjoy his talents for a while yet.\n\nMost five-wicket hauls for England in Tests James Anderson: 28 in 151 Tests Ian Botham: 27 in 102 Tests Sydney Barnes: 24 in 27 Tests Graeme Swann: 17 in 60 Tests Fred Trueman: 17 in 67 Tests Derek Underwood: 17 in 86 Tests Stuart Broad: 17 in 136 Tests\n\n'A terrific day for England' - what they said\n\nEngland's James Anderson on Sky Sports: \"We've had a really good day. We wanted to be ruthless with the ball and we were.\n\n\"I have missed Test cricket. It gives you a buzz when you get out there. The biggest thing for me at Centurion was getting through it.

Ricky Gervais reclaimed his throne\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhen Ricky Gervais first hosted the Globes in 2010, his cutting comments and sarcastic style was a master class in ridiculing celebrities and set a blueprint for the ceremony's future hosts.\n\nThis year, he sensibly pre-empted the inevitable social media outrage over his politically incorrect gags by telling the audience: \"Remember, they're just jokes. We're all going to die soon, and there's no sequel.\"\n\nHere are a few of his best:\n\n\"I came here in a limo tonight and the licence plate was made by Felicity Huffman.\"\n\n\"Martin Scorsese said the Marvel films remind him of theme parks. I don't know what he's doing hanging around theme parks - he's not big enough to go on the rides.\"\n\n\"Knives Out has three nominations tonight. See what can happen when you don't dress people up as Cats?\"\n\n\"We were going to do an In Memoriam section, but when I saw the list of people who had died this year, it wasn't diverse enough. It was mostly white people. And I thought, 'No, not on my watch.'\"\n\n\"In a moment we're going to see a short clip from The Irishman. It's 88 minutes long.\"\n\n\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was nearly three hours long. Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere, and by the end his date was too old for him.\"\n\n\"Lots of big celebrities here tonight. Legends. Icons. On the same table, there's Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Baby Yoda. Oh no, that's Joe Pesci, sorry.\"\n\n\"Kevin Hart was fired from the Oscars for some offensive tweets. Luckily for me, the Hollywood Foreign Press can barely speak English and they've no idea what Twitter is, so I got offered this gig by fax.\"\n\n2. Ellen's acceptance speech poked fun at acceptance speeches\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\n\"The thing I like about this award is that coming in, I knew I was going win,\" joked talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as she accepted the Carol Burnett Award.\n\nThe prize recognises outstanding achievement in television and was only introduced as part of the ceremony last year.\n\nDeGeneres, who was announced as the winner in advance, also made light of several acceptance speech tropes and clich\u00e9s from the stage.\n\n\"I couldn't have done it without my husband Mark. Mark, you are my rock, thank you for supporting me through this crazy journey,\" she said to big laughs from the audience (which included her wife, Portia de Rossi).\n\n\"I know it wasn't easy for you or the kids - Rupert and Fiona, go to bed!\" she added, despite also not having any children.\n\n\"The important thing,\" she added on a more serious note, \"is that you all know me, and obviously you know me or else you wouldn't have laughed at all of that.\n\n\"I feel like we all think we know someone - there's a connection when we watch them on TV... Television inspired and influenced everything that I am today.\"\n\n3. Tom Hanks got emotional. Possibly because he had a cold\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe prestigious Cecil B DeMille Award - effectively the night's outstanding contribution prize - was given to awards season veteran and general legend Tom Hanks.\n\nHe told the audience he was feeling \"a little jittery\" because of how much orange juice he'd been drinking to try and get over a cold he'd had over the weekend.\n\nBeing ill turned out to be quite convenient, because when he became teary during his speech, he told the crowd: \"It's the cold that is making this happen. I swear to God, I'm not nearly this emotional at home.\"\n\nPaying tribute to his wife and children, he said: \"A man is blessed with a family sitting down front like that. A wife who has taught me what love is. Five kids who are wiser and braver than their old man is. I can't tell you how much your love means to me.\"\n\nAnd before he left, a provided a quick lesson in etiquette and punctuality for budding actors.\n\n\"Showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie,\" he said, to much applause.\n\n\"Those people with radios in their ears don't need to knock on your doors and say 'they're ready for you' because you're already ready. You have the freedom to settle down, because when the time comes, you have to hit the marks.\"\n\n4.

Not only was she vilified at the time, but the affair stalked her throughout her life. For the first time, a new drama reappraises her character by telling the story through her eyes, writes Tanya Gold.\n\nThe Profumo Affair, with its ingredients of sex, aristocrats and espionage, was a scandal so perfect it remains one of the most enduring in modern British political history. It is also a story that is often remembered as an overture to the Swinging Sixties - a tale of sexual liberation and hope, but one in which everyone who took part was punished.\n\nIt was 1961 in London and 19-year-old model Christine Keeler was sleeping with both John Profumo, 46, the Conservative Secretary of State for War, and Yevgeny Ivanov, 31, a naval attach\u00e9 at the Soviet embassy, and a spy. Keeler's enabler was her friend Stephen Ward, an osteopath and amateur artist who moved in aristocratic circles and introduced her to both men.\n\nAfter the affair was exposed, Profumo resigned, Keeler went to prison for perjury and Ward took his own life. The following year, Harold Macmillan's Conservative government fell - the Profumo Affair had exacerbated its rot. It is now dramatised, in minute detail, in a six-part BBC series The Trial of Christine Keeler by screenwriter and novelist Amanda Coe. Sophie Cookson stars as Keeler, Ben Miles plays Profumo and James Norton, Ward.\n\nUnlike Michael Caton-Jones's 1989 film Scandal, which focuses on Ward (John Hurt) and is over-jolly for the subject matter, Coe prefers to concentrate on Keeler herself.\n\n\"The story had never been told from the point of view of the woman at the centre of it,\" says Coe.\n\nImage caption Ben Miles as John Profumo and Sophie Cookson as Christine Keeler\n\nWho was Keeler? Superficially, a series of archetypes, and that is surely why she fascinated. You can project anything onto an archetype who is usually portrayed, as Coe says, as \"a dead-eyed siren\". Prime Minister Harold Macmillan called her a \"tart\", while Ward always called her his \"little baby\". Ward was fantasising about Keeler's compliance, and Macmillan was merely wrong.\n\nKeeler, who died in 2017, was never a prostitute. She was something more interesting and complex - a young woman who liked sex in an era when good girls didn't, or at least they pretended that they didn't. And so, Keeler became an unfortunate cipher for sexual promise when repression was a national disease. The term \"prostitute\" is merely a guilty slur.\n\nLater, for anyone who still cared, she was an object of pity, occasionally photographed by the tabloids as she tried and failed to thrive after the scandal, her famous beauty gone and with it, her small power.\n\nImage copyright Mirrorpix/ Getty Images Image caption Christine Keeler shortly before her trial\n\nKeeler was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in an unhappy and impoverished home - a house made from two converted railway carriages. Her father abandoned her mother during World War Two, and at one point, Keeler was removed from her mother when it was discovered the child was suffering from malnutrition.\n\nKeeler had the complex gift of beauty, and men used her for it. Her stepfather, she reveals in her memoir Secrets and Lies, assaulted her when she was 12 and asked her to run away with him because he did not love her mother. Local fathers assaulted her when she babysat their children. She left school at 15 without qualifications and became pregnant by an American serviceman. She apparently tried to abort the child herself, but failed, and it died at six days old. In the 1950s, there was no pity for young women who suffered as Keeler did, but there was much reproach.\n\nImage copyright Bob Hope / Getty Images Image caption Secretary of State for War John Profumo at Sandown Park Racecourse in 1963\n\nShe ran away to London and became a show girl at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho, dancing topless for \u00a38.50 a week. It was here that she met Stephen Ward. We might presume now that she was still suffering from the early neglect, the assaults and the death of her child - certainly Sophie Cookson plays Keeler as unknowable and untouchable.\n\nWard was from a bourgeois background - his father was a Torquay vicar - and he loved to court aristocrats. He also enjoyed the company of working-class girls like Keeler. She became one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, and while he never slept with her, he did take her to orgies and eased her into love affairs that would benefit him socially. She was his living, breathing toy. He groomed her - although in Coe's telling and James Norton's tender and bewildered performance, Ward, too, is vulnerable - a man on the outside looking in. Perhaps this is what bound him and Keeler together.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Stephen Ward at one of his art exhibitions\n\nLord Astor, who slept with Keeler's friend Mandy Rice-Davies, allowed Ward to rent a cottage in the grounds of Cliveden, his country home. It was there in July 1961, while swimming naked in a pool in a walled garden, that Keeler met the 5th Baron Profumo, who was married to the f\u00eated actress Valerie Hobson. She says he chased her, trying to remove her towel.\n\nThey had an affair, but it lasted only months.\n\nWhy did she do it? I suspect that after her youthful experiences of abandonment and betrayal, she wanted to please men, and Ward in particular, since he noticed her and appeared to cherish his \"little baby\". Was it easier to say yes, and to do what they wanted - since it was all they wanted? Keeler's testimony about Profumo suggests that tenderness from men could move her: \"I enjoyed it,\" she wrote of the sex, \"for he was kind and loving afterwards\".\n\nImage copyright Bettmann / Getty Images Image caption John Profumo with his actress wife, Valerie Hobson after resigning from his post\n\nBut not everyone was \"kind and loving\" in this context. There were many beatings for a beautiful girl who liked sex. She was involved with Jamaican jazz singer Aloysius \"Lucky\" Gordon, who raped her and held her hostage; it was that affair that exposed the wider scandal, and led to her prison sentence. Keeler had already left Gordon when he was wounded in a fight with Johnny Edgecombe - another of her lovers. Edgecombe stalked Keeler to Ward's flat in Wimpole Mews, central London, in December 1962 and fired gunshots at the front door. The police were called, the press was alerted, and the Profumo Affair began to unravel.\n\nImage caption Sophie Cookson as Christine Keeler, with Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as boyfriend Johnny Edgecombe\n\nJust two years earlier, the Portland Spy Ring had been uncovered, leading to the conviction of five people for passing secrets to Russia. Now, the confection of espionage (Keeler had been sleeping with a Russian spy), sex, aristocracy and race - Edgecombe and Gordon were both of West Indian descent - was irresistible. Keeler, from anger and naivety, sold her story to the newspapers and became famous and reviled at the same time.\n\n\"Lucky\" Gordon was jailed for assault, but when Keeler withdrew her testimony, she was imprisoned for perjury. Ward, meanwhile, was punished with a spurious accusation of living off the immoral earnings of prostitutes. In fact, Keeler and Rice-Davies, who had both lived with him, had merely contributed to the telephone bills and repaid money he had lent them. But the order was given to Scotland Yard to \"get Ward\" and they obeyed. Memories are long. A submission to review the conviction in 2017 was denied; the official material is sealed until 2046.\n\nThe wreckage of the affair was cast far and wide. No-one escaped uninjured, except Ward's aristocratic friends, who promptly - and inevitably - dropped him. Towards the end of his trial, Ward took an overdose of barbiturates. He died three days later. Profumo resigned from the government when it was revealed that he lied to the House of Commons about his affair with Keeler. He spent the rest of his life as a volunteer at an east London charity called Toynbee Hall.\n\nImage copyright Evening Standard / Getty Images Image caption Christine Keeler, October 1963\n\nHowever, his CBE from Elizabeth II in 1975 signalled society's forgiveness, and he was invited to Margaret Thatcher's 70th birthday party, where he was seated next to the Queen. Lord Longford said he felt more admiration for Profumo than \"all the men I've known in my lifetime\". In this reading, Profumo remains, eternally, Keeler's victim, and the obituaries after he died in 2006 were kind. Misogyny dies hard.\n\nFor Keeler, there was no such redemption - at least, perhaps, until now, when in Coe's telling, she can step out from behind her archetypes and be seen as whole and with agency.\n\nThe scandal stalked her throughout her life, particularly after her own sexuality entered the national culture and became part of it - her portrait, by Ward, a talented amateur artist, is owned by the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nShe was poorly educated but not stupid, and when she said, \"I took on the sins of everybody, of a generation, really\", it feels true.\n\nImage caption Sophie Cookson playing Christine Keeler and Ellie Bamber playing Mandy Rice-Davies\n\nSo, it is gratifying that Coe, in detailing her story so precisely, makes Keeler so human - a young woman who walked blithely through life and made mistakes, for which she paid too high a price. Nor does Coe keep Keeler forever entombed in 1963, the year of her infamy, and the year that she posed for a portrait that has become one of the defining images of the decade.\n\nIn the photo, an apparently naked Keeler straddles a chair which has been positioned with its back to the camera.\n\nAccording to Coe, Keeler had been adamant in later interviews that she had refused to pose naked - that she had in fact worn knickers for the photo, and had pulled them out of the way of the shot.\n\nThe \"naked\" Keeler is just another myth, she says - another example of how she has been misrepresented.\n\nThe final scene of The Trial of Christine Keeler looks forwards from that 1963 moment - it has her dancing in a reverie, with closed eyes and upturned arms.\n\nThe Trial of Christine Keeler continues on Monday 30 December and then on Sunday nights at 21:00 on BBC One."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-50713991", "published": "2019-12-28T00:41:55", "title": "The anti-vaccination movement that gripped Victorian England", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition to vaccination is as old as the process - as are fears of its side effects\n\nThe distrust of doctors and government that feeds the anti-vaccination movement might be seen as a modern phenomenon, but the roots of today's activism were put down well over a century ago.\n\nIn the late 19th Century, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to compulsory smallpox vaccinations. There were arrests, fines and people were even sent to jail.\n\nBanners were brandished demanding \"Repeal the Vaccination Acts, the curse of our nation\" and vowing \"Better a felon's cell than a poisoned babe\". Copies of hated laws were burned in the streets and the effigy was lynched of the humble country doctor who was seen as to blame for the smallpox prevention programme.\n\nWarning - this story contains graphic images\n\nAt the height of this fight, the people of Leicester, a city in the English Midlands, claimed to have found an alternative to vaccination - and it's an approach that is still quoted by campaigners today.\n\nThe shockwaves from this storm of anti-establishment anger went far beyond the streets of Leicester and the group behind it, formed 150 years ago.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The \"speckled monster\" - shown on this preserved foot - had devastated entire cultures\n\nSmallpox, called the \"speckled monster\" due to its distinctive blister-like rashes, had killed millions since medieval times.\n\nAt one stage it was the single biggest cause of death in Europe, killing 400,000 every year. In the Americas it ravaged native tribes and entire cultures collapsed.\n\nA third of survivors were blinded. Almost all who did not die were scarred for life.\n\nSo why did a cheap and apparently effective solution - vaccination - threaten to tear society apart?\n\nImage copyright Global Freedom Movement Image caption One anti-vax website cites \"The City of Leicester: Sanitation Trumps Vaccination\" as one of its \"5 Historical Vaccine Scandals\"\n\nThe story starts in 1798 with Gloucestershire doctor Edward Jenner successfully testing the country-lore that a dose of relatively mild cowpox infection gave protection from smallpox.\n\nWithin five years, Jenner's discovery was being used across Europe and a decade later it had gone global.\n\nBut opposition was swift and savage.\n\nImage copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption In this cartoon, vaccination was depicted as a diseased cow-like monster being fed children\n\n\"This came from a variety of angles - sanitary, religious, scientific and political,\" said medical historian Dr Kristin Hussey.\n\n\"Some felt the method - using material from cows - was unhealthy or unchristian, using matter from lower creatures.\n\n\"Some disputed smallpox was passed from person to person, but many simply objected to being told what was good for them.\"\n\nImage caption There were many and varied ways to die in London in 1801 and doctors seemingly had few answers\n\nThere followed a 100-year battle between the authorities and an often sceptical, sometimes aggressive, public.\n\nIn Britain, a succession of laws made vaccinations free, then compulsory - backed by fines and even imprisonment. While riots flared in some towns, there was also more restrained opposition in the form of anti-vaccination leagues.\n\nFor an increasingly literate population, pamphlets were produced with titles like \"Vaccination: its fallacies and evils\", \"Vaccination, a Curse\" and the suitably Gothic \"Horrors of Vaccination\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The slums of the Industrial Revolution were a breeding ground for disease\n\nDr Hussey said: \"In modern terms, it was a very 'woke' time.\n\n\"People were asking questions about rights, especially working-class rights. There was a sense the upper classes were trying to take advantage, a feeling of distrust.\n\n\"This was a move into an area of people's private lives, their health, which had not been governed before.\n\n\"And vaccines were not as safe as they are now - people did become seriously ill and even died.

An 1848 medical book claimed common causes of illness were \"diseased parents\", night air, sedentary habits, wet feet and abrupt changes of temperature.\n\nIt stated cholera, a scourge of Victorian society, was caused by rancid food, \"cold fruits\" like cucumbers and melons, and passionate fear or rage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Street remedies were sometimes the only option open for the poor\n\nIn 1850 the average life expectancy was not much above 40 years, and 15% of children died before the age of one.\n\nThe 1858 Medical Act brought in standards and registration but this was at a time when the majority of professionals still believed bad air - miasma - caused many illnesses.\n\nGerm theory - that microscopic organisms invading the body can cause disease - was not widely accepted until the 1880s.\n\nAlongside qualified medics were the quacks and traditional healers - and without a health service, everyone charged for their services, excluding many from all but the most basic care.\n\nAt this point, immunisation was still in its infancy and naturally produced cowpox material varied in quality.\n\nWhat is more, it took decades to realise vaccination failed to give lifelong immunity, while clumsy procedures could lead to secondary infections, such as syphilis, hepatitis and tuberculosis.\n\nThe Leicester Anti-Vaccination League was set up in 1869 but the approach that would be lauded by those opposed to vaccination came in 1877, ironically enough, from the medical establishment.\n\nThe city medical examiner made it compulsory to report cases of smallpox. He would then isolate the patient, quarantine family and disinfect - and sometimes burn - belongings.\n\nOriginally designed to work alongside vaccination, the League promoted it as an alternative and the \"Leicester method\" sparked growing defiance.\n\nTimeline\n\nImage copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption Edward Jenner carried out a series of tests on children before publishing his ideas\n\n1796 - Edward Jenner successfully tests the idea that cowpox protects against smallpox\n\n1805 - First attempt at compulsory vaccination, in Italy, fails\n\n1820 - Smallpox deaths in London fall significantly\n\n1840 - Vaccination Act makes vaccinations free\n\n1853 - New Vaccination Act makes vaccination compulsory in the first three months of a child's life\n\n1867 - Vaccinations compulsory for all children below 14\n\n1869 - Leicester Anti-Vaccination League founded\n\n1885 - Mass protest held in Leicester\n\n1898 - Vaccination Act introduces \"conscientious objection\" clause\n\nScience writer Jason \"The Germ Guy\" Tetro sees powerful echoes in today's controversy.\n\n\"We tend to hear civil rights as a major factor in detractors' arguments,\" he said. \"They feel the government is imposing too many restrictions on their liberties by invoking mandatory vaccinations.\n\n\"This is similar to what was heard in Leicester.

I am not sure how that would go over in today's world.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The mid 19th Century was a time of political and social protest\n\nIn Leicester the number of prosecutions for non-vaccination grew from two in 1869 to 1,154 in 1881 and about 3,000 in 1884.\n\nFigures for the second half of 1883 showed in Leicester, of 2,281 births only 707 babies were vaccinated.\n\nCourt cases provided incendiary publicity for the anti-vax movement.\n\nIn March 1884, resident George Bamford told magistrates his three eldest children had been vaccinated. Two had been confined to bed for days and a third had died.\n\nFor refusing to vaccinate his fourth child, he was ordered to pay 10 shillings - half the average weekly wage - or spend seven days in prison.\n\nFines were fiercely enforced. Police collecting a fine from one Arthur Ward threatened his pregnant wife with prison. The argument sent her into premature labour and the child was stillborn.\n\nImage copyright Jenner Trust Image caption Brothers, one vaccinated, one not, were pictured in the Leicester smallpox isolation hospital\n\nIn October 1884 the Leicester Board of Guardians asked the London authorities for an easing of prosecutions, in the light of the Leicester method. The request was rejected, setting the stage for the city's mass protest of 1885.\n\nAlthough peaceful, the scale of the demonstration shook the establishment. Medical professionals feared for the unvaccinated city, predicting \"a terrible nemesis would overtake it in the shape of a disastrous epidemic\".\n\nSmallpox duly returned between 1892 and 1894. And the result shocked many.\n\nImage copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption An unvaccinated smallpox victim in Gloucester in 1896. He survived - dozens did not\n\nLeicester actually escaped relatively lightly, with 370 cases - a rate of 20.5 cases per 10,000 of the population - resulting in 21 deaths. This was a far lower figure of cases than in some well-vaccinated towns like Warrington (125) and Sheffield (144).\n\nAnti-vaccinationists were triumphant, claiming the Leicester method had been proven.\n\nMr Tetro said: \"The so-called marvellous success of the Leicester method was based on the fact it used a tried and true method of notification and quarantine in combination with the benefit of a hospital and the use of a type of ring vaccination in which healthcare staff were vaccinated.\n\n\"In a small population, this can work but as the population grows, this method becomes untenable.\n\n\"This was seen in 1893 when people had to resort to staying at home instead of being cared for in a hospital during an epidemic that led to hundreds of infections.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A global vaccination programme saw smallpox declared eradicated by the 1970s\n\nThe flip side was that in London - where vaccination was widespread - there was success in containing smallpox, with 5.5 cases per 10,000 people. And some poorly vaccinated places, like Dewsbury (339 cases) and Gloucester (501), were badly hit.\n\nAnd Leicester had the highest proportion of cases - more than two thirds - in under 10s.\n\nNonetheless, the headlines and protests, along with a growing understanding of how diseases spread, resulted in significant change.\n\nIn 1898 a new Vaccination Act introduced a clause allowing people to opt out for moral reasons - the first time \"conscientious objection\" was recognised in UK law.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition to vaccinations has endured despite overwhelming medical evidence of their success\n\nThe following year, notification of various infectious diseases, including smallpox, became compulsory. And while smallpox returned to Britain in the early 20th Century, it never carried the same threat.\n\nAs the use of vaccines spread - along with improved sanitation - smallpox was pushed out of Europe and North America.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) global eradication programme was launched in 1959 and intensified in 1967. Apart from a death linked to a Birmingham laboratory, the last case was recorded in Somalia in 1977.\n\nImage copyright Twitter Image caption The Leicester method is regularly quoted in vaccine debates on social media\n\nHowever, opposition to vaccines - questioning their efficiency and safety - continues.

Parts of the medical profession, such as the Royal College of Paediatrics, believe it would be counterproductive and make people more suspicious.\n\nEarlier this year, the WHO declared \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the top 10 threats to global health.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption People queuing for smallpox vaccination in Niger 1969\n\nOwen Gower, the manager of the Jenner's House Museum, reflected on the country doctor's legacy.\n\n\"Countless deaths and incidences of the severe scarring and blindness that the disease could cause have been averted, thanks to Jenner's discovery and his determination to tell the world about it.\n\n\"Now we have the opportunity to do the same with other diseases.

The resulting siege, writes the BBC's Eli Melki, shook the Muslim world to its foundations and changed the course of Saudi history.\n\nIn the early hours of 20 November 1979, some 50,000 faithful from all over the world gathered for dawn prayers in the huge courtyard surrounding the sacred Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest place. Among them mingled 200 men led by a charismatic 40-year-old preacher called Juhayman al-Utaybi.\n\nAs, the imam finished leading prayers, Juhayman and his followers pushed him aside and seized the microphone.\n\nThey had placed closed coffins in the centre of the yard, a traditional act of seeking blessings for the recently deceased. But when the coffins were opened, they revealed handguns and rifles, which were quickly distributed among the men.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Kaaba in 1971\n\nOne of them began to read a prepared speech: \"Fellow Muslims, we announce today the coming of the Mahdi\u2026 who shall reign with justice and fairness on Earth after it has been filled with injustice and oppression.\"\n\nFor the pilgrims in the courtyard, this was an extraordinary announcement. In the hadiths - reports of what the Prophet Muhammad said or approved - the coming of the Mahdi, or divinely guided one, is foretold. He is described as a man endowed with extraordinary powers by God, and some Muslims believe he will usher in an era of justice and true belief.\n\nThe preacher, Khaled al-Yami, a follower of Juhayman, claimed that \"countless visions have testified to the coming of the Mahdi\". Hundreds of Muslims had seen him in their dreams, Yami said, and now he was in their midst. The Mahdi's name was Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Qahtani.\n\nIn an audio recording of the speech, Juhayman can be heard interrupting the speaker from time to time to direct his men to close the shrine's gates and take up sniper positions in its tall minarets, which then dominated the city of Mecca.\n\n''Attention brothers! Ahmad al-Lehebi, go up on the roof. If you see someone resisting at the gates, shoot them!''\n\nAccording to an anonymous witness, Juhayman was the first to pay homage to the Mahdi, and immediately others started following his example. Cries of \"God is great!\" rang out.\n\nBut there was confusion too. Abdel Moneim Sultan, an Egyptian religious student who had got to know some of Juhayman's followers, recalls that the Grand Mosque was full of foreign visitors who spoke little Arabic and did not know what was happening.\n\nImage caption Abdel Moneim Sultan, a student in 1979, was a witness to the events\n\nThe sight of armed gunmen in a space in which the Koran strictly forbids any violence, and a few gunshots, also stunned many worshippers, who scrambled to reach any exits still left open.\n\n''People were surprised at the sight of gunmen... This is something they were not used to. There is no doubt this horrified them. This was something outrageous,'' says Abdel Moneim Sultan.\n\nBut in just an hour the audacious takeover was complete. The armed group was now in full control of the Grand Mosque, mounting a direct challenge to the authority of the Saudi royal family.\n\nThe men who took over the Grand Mosque belonged to an association called al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Muhtasiba (JSM) which condemned what it perceived as the degeneration of social and religious values in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFlush with oil money, the country was gradually transforming into a consumerist society. Cars and electrical goods were becoming commonplace, the country was urbanising, and in some regions men and women began to mix in public.\n\nBut the JSM's members continued to live an austere life, proselytising, studying the Koran and the hadiths, and adhering to the tenets of Islam as defined by the Saudi religious establishment.\n\nJuhayman, one of the JSM's founders - who hailed from Sajir, a Bedouin settlement in the centre of the country - confessed to his followers that his past was far from perfect. During a long evening around a fireplace in the desert, or a gathering in the house of one of his supporters, he would tell his personal story of fall and redemption to a captivated audience.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption The siege triggered protests by Muslims in other parts of the world\n\nUsama al-Qusi, a religious student who frequented the group's meetings, heard Juhayman say that he had been involved in \"illegal trading, including drug smuggling\".\n\nHowever, he had repented, found solace in religion and became a zealous and devoted leader - and many members of the JSM, especially the younger ones, fell under his spell.\n\nMost of those who knew him, such as religious student Mutwali Saleh, attest of his force of personality as well as his devotion: \"Nobody saw this man and didn't like him. He was strange. He had what is called charisma. He was true to his mission, and he gave his whole life to Allah, day and night.\"\n\nHowever, for a religious leader he was poorly educated.\n\n\"Juhayman was keen to go to the isolated and the rural areas where Bedouins live,\" Nasser al-Hozeimi, a close follower, recalls. \"Because his classical Arabic [the language mastered by all scholars of Islam] was weak and he had a strong Bedouin accent, he avoided addressing any educated audience to avoid being exposed.\"\n\nMore from BBC Arabic\n\nOn the other hand, Juhayman had served as a soldier in the National Guard, and his rudimentary military training proved important when it came to organising the takeover.\n\nEventually, the JSM began to clash with some Saudi clerics and a crackdown by the authorities ensued.\n\nJuhayman fled to the desert, where he wrote a series of pamphlets criticising the Saudi royal family for what he considered it to be its decadence, and accusing clerics of colluding with it for earthly gains. He became convinced that Saudi Arabia had been corrupted and that only a heavenly intervention could bring salvation.\n\nIt was at this point that he identified the Mahdi as Mohammad Bin Abdullah al-Qahtani, a soft-spoken young preacher known for his good manners, devotion and poetry.\n\nThe hadiths talk of a Mahdi with a first name and father's name similar to the prophet's, and features outlined by a large forehead and a pronounced thin, aquiline nose. Juhayman saw all of this in al-Qahtani, but the supposed saviour himself was taken aback by the idea. Overwhelmed, he retreated into prayer.\n\nEventually, however, he emerged from his isolation convinced that Juhayman was right. He took on the role of Mahdi, and the alliance with Juhayman was sealed all the more tightly when Qahtani's older sister became Juhayman's second wife.\n\nConveniently, a few months before the siege, strange rumours spread that hundreds of Meccans and pilgrims had seen al-Qahtani in their dreams, standing tall in the Grand Mosque and holding the banner of Islam.\n\nJuhayman's followers were convinced. Mutwali Saleh, a member of the JSM, recalls: \"I remember the last meeting when a brother asked me, 'Brother Mutwali, what do you think about the Mahdi?' I said to him, 'Excuse me please, don't talk about this subject.' Then someone said to me, 'You are a silent devil. Brother, the Mahdi is real and he is Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Qahtani.'\"\n\nIn the remote areas where he had sought refuge, Juhayman and his followers began to prepare for the violent conflict to come.\n\nThe Saudi leadership reacted sluggishly to the seizure of the Grand Mosque.\n\nCrown Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz al-Saud was in Tunisia at the Arab League summit and Prince Abdullah, head of the National Guard - an elite security force tasked with protecting royal leaders - was in Morocco. It was left to the ailing King Khaled and Defence Minister Prince Sultan to co-ordinate a response.\n\nThe Saudi police at first failed to understand the scale of the problem and sent a couple of patrol cars to investigate, but as they drove up to the Grand Mosque they came under a hail of bullets.\n\nOnce the gravity of the situation became clear, units of the National Guard launched a hasty effort to retake control of the shrine.\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nMark Hambley, a political officer at the US embassy in Jeddah and one of the few Westerners who were aware of the situation, says this assault was brave but na\u00efve. \"They were immediately shot down,\" he says. \"The sharp-shooters had very good weapons, very good calibre Belgian rifles.\"\n\nIt became clear that the insurgents had planned their attack in detail and would not be easy to dislodge. A security cordon was established around the Grand Mosque, and special forces, paratroopers and armoured units were called in.\n\nReligious student Abdel Moneim Sultan, who was trapped inside, says clashes intensified from after noon on the second day. ''I saw artillery fire directed towards the minarets, and I saw helicopters hovering constantly in the air, and I also saw military airplanes,\" he remembers.\n\nThe Grand Mosque is a vast building consisting mainly of galleries and corridors, hundreds of meters long, surrounding the Kaaba's courtyard, and built on two floors. During the next two days, the Saudi units launched frontal assaults in an effort to gain entrance. But the rebels repelled wave after wave of attacks, despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered.\n\nAbdel Moneim Sultan recalls that Juhayman appeared supremely confident and relaxed when they met near the Kaaba that day. \"He slept for half an hour or 45 minutes resting his head on my leg, while his wife stood by. She never left his side,\" he says.\n\nThe rebels lit fires with carpets and rubber tires to generate heavy clouds of smoke, then they hid behind columns before stepping out of the dark to ambush emerging Saudi troops. The building was turned into a killing zone, and the casualties quickly rose into the hundreds.\n\n\"This was a man-to-man confrontation, within a limited space,\" says Maj Mohammad al-Nufai, the commander of the Ministry of Interior's special forces. \"A combat situation with bullets whizzing by, left and right - it's something unbelievable.\"\n\nA fatwa issued by the Kingdom's main clerics, assembled by King Khaled, cleared the Saudi military to use any degree of force to expel the rebels. Anti-tank guided missiles and heavy guns were then employed to dislodge the rebels from the minarets, and armoured personnel carriers were sent in to breach the gates.\n\nThe rebels were galvanised by the Mahdi. \"I saw him with two minor injuries under his eyes and his thowb (his dress) was riddled with holes from gunshots,\" says Abdel Moneim Sultan. \"He believed that he could expose himself anywhere out of the conviction that he was immortal - he was the Mahdi, after all.\"\n\nBut Qahtani's belief in his own invulnerability was unfounded and he was soon struck by gunfire.\n\nImage caption Mark Hambley: The Saudis pushed the rebels deeper into the catacombs\n\n\"When he was hit, people started to shout: 'The Mahdi is injured, the Mahdi is injured!' Some tried to run towards him to rescue him, but the heavy fire prevented them from doing this, and they had to retreat,\" the anonymous witness says.\n\nThey told Juhayman that the Mahdi had been hit, but he declared to his followers: \"Do not believe them. They are deserters!\"\n\nIt was only on the sixth day of fighting that the Saudi security forces managed to take control of the courtyard of the mosque and the buildings surrounding it. But the remaining rebels merely retreated to a labyrinth of hundreds of rooms and cells underneath, convinced by Juhayman that the Mahdi was still alive, somewhere in the building.\n\nTheir situation was now dire, though. \"The smells surrounded us from the dead or the injuries that had rotted,\" says the anonymous witness. \"In the beginning, water was available, but later on they started to ration supplies. Then the dates ran out so they started eating balls of raw dough... It was a terrifying atmosphere. It was like you were in a horror movie.\"\n\nAlthough the Saudi government issued one communiqu\u00e9 after the other announcing victory, the absence of prayers broadcast to the Islamic world told another story. \"The Saudis tried tactic after tactic, and it didn't work,\" says Hambley. \"It was pushing the rebels deeper and deeper into the catacombs.\"\n\nIt was clear the Saudi government needed help to capture the leaders alive and put an end to the siege. They turned to French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing.\n\n\"Our ambassador told me that it was obvious the Saudi forces were very disorganised and didn't know how to react,\" Giscard d'Estaing tells the BBC, confirming for the first time France's role in this crisis.\n\nImage caption Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing\n\n\"It seemed to me to be dangerous, because of the weakness of the system, its unpreparedness and the repercussions this could have on the global oil market.\"\n\nThe French president discreetly dispatched three advisers from the recently formed counter-terror unit, GIGN. The operation had to remain secret, to avoid any criticism of Western intervention in the birthplace of Islam.\n\nThe French team was headquartered in a hotel in the nearby town of Taif, from where it devised a plan to flush out the rebels - the basements would be filled with gas, to render the air unbreathable.\n\nImage caption The French commandos, Paul Barril on the left\n\n\"Holes were dug every 50m in order to reach the basement,\" says Capt Paul Barril, who was in charge of executing the operation. \"Gas was injected through these holes. The gas was dispersed with the help of grenade explosions into every corner where the rebels were hiding.\"\n\nFor the anonymous witness, holed up down in the basement with the last of the resisting rebels, the world seemed to be coming to an end.\n\n\"The feeling was as though death had come to us, because you didn't know whether this was the sound of digging or of a rifle, it was a terrifying situation.''\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe French plan proved successful.\n\n\"Juhayman ran out of ammunition and food in the last two days,\" says Nasser al-Hozeimi, one of his followers. \"They were gathered in a small room and the soldiers were throwing smoke bombs on them through a hole they made in the ceiling... That's why they surrendered. Juhayman left and all of them followed.\"\n\nMaj Nufai witnessed the meeting that followed, between the Saudi princes and a stunned but unrepentant Juhayman: \"Prince Saud al-Faisal asked him: 'Why, Juhayman?' He answered: 'It's only fate.' 'Do you need anything?' He just said: 'I want some water.'\"\n\nJuhayman was paraded before the cameras, and just over a month later 63 of the rebels were publicly executed in eight cities across Saudi Arabia. Juhayman was the first to die.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Juhayman al-Utaybi\n\nWhile Juhayman's belief in the Mahdi may have set him apart, he was part of a wider movement of social and religious conservatism reacting against modernity, in which hardline clerics gained the upper hand over the royal family.\n\nOne man on whom the siege had a profound effect was Osama Bin Laden. In one of his pamphlets against the Saudi ruling family, he said they had \"desecrated the Haram, when this crisis could have been solved peacefully\". He went on: \"I still remember to this day the traces of their tracks on the Haram's floor tiles.\"\n\n\"Juhayman's actions stopped all modernisation,\" Nasser al-Huzaimi says. \"Let me give you a simple example. One of the things he demanded from the Saudi government was the removal of female presenters from TV. After the Haram incident, no female presenter appeared on TV again.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia remained on this ultra-conservative path for most of the next four decades. Only recently have there been signs of a thaw.\n\nIn an interview in March 2018, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, said that before 1979, \"We were living a normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries, women were driving cars, there were movie theatres in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nHe was referring above all to the siege of the Grand Mosque."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-50843474", "published": "2019-12-19T01:12:50", "title": "A school looking after its children \u2013 and their families", "text": "Image copyright Alison Baskerville\n\nThe government says school funding is at record levels, but Bellfield Junior School in Northfield, Birmingham, still finds it hard to make ends meet.

Parents regularly need debt counselling, help with parenting skills, or simply some emergency food shopping. It's not unheard of for head teacher Nigel Attwood to switch off his computer at the end of the school day and then to jump in his car to go to the supermarket, and to take supplies to a family in crisis, to make sure their children are fed through the weekend.\n\nThe school has also had to step in to pay gas and electricity bills for struggling families, while teachers have been approached by shame-faced parents needing help to provide Christmas dinner. At a parents' evening, two mothers tell me confidentially that during difficult family times, the Rainbow Room has often saved their sanity. Both independently describe the primary school's pastoral care service as a \"lifeline\".\n\nLorraine tells me that when she first started work at the school, 18 years ago, there was an educational social worker working beside her. But now, she and Jamie, neither of whom are trained psychologists, are completely on their own. When I ask her if she feels out of her depth sometimes, she shakes her head slowly and looks wearily at Jamie.\n\nThere's a very small pot of money within the pastoral budget to bring in specialised counsellors and educational psychologists.\n\n\"I don't think we are always the best placed people to be pushing for these children,\" Jamie admits. \"But the systems aren't there. Children's services are a sham at the moment. We get frustrated with them but we know the pressure they're under and why they struggle to do the things we think they should do.\"\n\nAnother small, tear-stained face has appeared at the Rainbow Room's window and looks in hopefully. Jamie walks slowly towards the door.\n\n\"But somebody's got to keep pushing for these children,\" he says over his shoulder. \"Somebody's got to keep pushing.\"\n\nThe four-and-a-half-day week\n\nEmma Jane Kirby reported in June on Bellfield's decision to drop down to a four-and-a-half-day week.\n\nIt was feared that attendance might suffer as a result, but Nigel Attwood says attendance is now at its highest rate in 12 years.\n\nOver the six months that I've been visiting Bellfield Junior School, there have been incidents that we cannot report for legal reasons. Last month, the receptionist who tots up attendance figures, alerted the pastoral team when she tried to contact the parents of a child with an unexplained absence from school. Alarmingly, the given telephone numbers proved to be unattributed or simply rang out.\n\n\"The families that resist our help we worry about,\" says Jamie. \"Because then other services have to move in on an emergency basis, and that's never good.\"\n\nLorraine's eyes are unfocused when she talks about the children she suspects of being physically or sexually abused.\n\n\"We have sessions with them, we try to get them to talk,\" she says, \"but unless they actually tell us, there's really nothing we can do.\" She's also concerned about parental drug and alcohol abuse, which she says always leaves children neglected.\n\nWe sit in silence for a moment. Jamie offers to switch on the soothing tweeting \"dicky-birds\" CD. The brightly coloured puppet slips from Lorraine's knee on to the floor.\n\nLorraine admits that she can't always sleep after a heavy day in the Rainbow Room. Often during the holidays, she says, she finds herself dialling Jamie's number for a chat. Jamie protests that he always slept peacefully when he worked as a police officer - there's no bravado in his voice when he says that policing was child's play next to his current job.\n\nThe thin little girl has reappeared at the door and squints at us anxiously through the glass. Lorraine gets up wearily.\n\nBut today it's celebration time and on stage now in the hall, Year 5 is belting out the Calypso carol while the shepherds and their flock sway self-consciously. Every child is word-perfect and completely focused on the performance. Those with speaking parts deliver their lines with evident pride and professionalism, ignoring interruptions from audience members' beeping mobile phones and younger siblings clamouring for juice or the toilet.\n\nBy the time they get to We Three Kings, any residual nerves have dissipated and each child is jubilant and sings joyfully. Their teachers watch them with genuine emotion and the applause is thunderous.\n\nNigel Attwood is grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"We've done a lot of work with the children on resilience and aspirations,\" he shouts over the noise of scraping chairs as the hall is cleared. \"And it looks like it's really paid off.\"\n\nHe pauses to congratulate an elated angel who is galloping back to class, still humming the Calypso carol under her breath.\n\n\"Some of our children have some really huge problems,\" Nigel reminds me. \"But tell me, did that show when they were up on that stage? The children gave it everything they've got.\"\n\nSince I began following Bellfield Juniors back in June, the school has had some glad tidings of its own. Although the BBC has not been fund-raising for the school and nor did Bellfield agree to take part in our programmes in the hope of receiving donations, nonetheless a number of concerned well-wishers have sent gifts of money, stationery, books and shoes, all of which have deeply touched head teacher Nigel Attwood and his deputy, Claire du Toit.\n\nLast summer, Claire complained there were no whiteboard markers left in her classroom and that she couldn't order more until the new term and the new budget. The next day a jiffy bag of pens was pushed through the school's letter-box. Over the following weeks, several more packs arrived by post until Bellfield's supplies cupboard contained more than 700 pens. Cheques from \u00a35 to \u00a3500 flooded in to help fix draughty windows, to fund school prizes and educational visits. And three huge consignments of shoes, sandals, trainers and wellies were sent from a shoe shop in the Channel Islands.\n\n\"If you could see the look on the children's faces when they get a brand-new pair of shoes or wellies,\" laughs Nigel. \"The way they look after them and how they go skipping down the corridor!\"\n\n\"It's such a total surprise to see how other people do things for you and it gives you faith in the world really,\" interjects Claire. \"Everybody's looking out for everybody and we're not on our own.\"\n\nThere was a moment last month, though, when the school really felt it was sinking. After breakfast club one morning, the dinner ladies noticed that the floor in the dining hall was buckling. Nigel Attwood showed me the damage and laughed bitterly when I asked him how he was going to manage the cost of replacing the floor. He retired to his office to punch numbers into a calculator but it was clear that, however good he may be at juggling figures, the repair work would push the school into deficit.\n\nAnd then, incredibly, two BBC listeners stepped in and sent a cheque for \u00a320,000 - enough to cover replacing the dining hall floor. Nigel Attwood and Claire du Toit still have difficulty expressing how they felt when they opened the envelope.\n\n\"I thought they'd got the noughts in the wrong place,\" smiles Nigel. \"Honestly, I was speechless. I have no words.\"\n\nAlthough he has never shared the school's financial difficulties with the pupils, he did decide to tell the children on the School Council (who are like prefects) about the donations. Flabbergasted, they asked first why someone wanted to help their little school so much and then immediately afterwards, asked if they might write the donors a letter of thanks?\n\n\"Apart from the overwhelming generosity, it's the fact that people are getting a really clear message about what's happening in school,\" reflects Claire. \"It's the understanding, really, that we did this for. Because it gets hidden under all sorts of other headlines\u2026 and there are so many schools in this position.\"\n\nShe taps her pen on the desk to emphasise her point.\n\n\"It's the education of the children that suffers. And each year that goes by, each year it gets worse for them.\"\n\nOutside the staff room, Jamie Neadle is trying to cajole a little boy who's squeezed himself into a corner and who's hiding his face in his hood, back to his classroom. Recently a concerned psychologist who heard Jamie speak of Bellfield's difficulties on the radio, telephoned the school to offer staff some free training.\n\nThe \u00a3114,000 a year that Bellfield spends on pastoral care could pay for three more teachers, for more classroom assistants, for necessary school repairs. When budgets are stretched so tightly, difficult choices have to be made and Lorraine Harvey and Jamie Neadle say that since they are not part of the core teaching service, they always fear the axe might fall on their department.\n\n\"We can understand that, but what happens to the children then?\" asks Lorraine rhetorically.\n\nAstoundingly, on the day I visit in October, she has spent much of her morning counselling a scared 10-year-old who's been approached by the local gun and knife gangs.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she nods when I look at her incredulously. \"Gangs. It's constant. And it's mainly gun-gangs round here and some of our children are allowed to wander Northfield alone, so, you know, it's easy for the gangs to pick on them. The children just don't see the danger.\"\n\nJamie agrees.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more of it,\" he says. \"We have children interacting with gangs on a daily basis because their parents don't know where they are. You have to remember a lot of our children don't have much, they don't have nice things, so if someone offers them something\u2026\"\n\nHe presses his fists to his temples.\n\n\"We haven't lost a child to a gang yet, but it's yet.\"\n\nLorraine and Jamie begin to tidy the Rainbow Room, turning off lights and plumping the cushions.\n\n\"You know,\" says Jamie suddenly, with barely suppressed anger, \"we sit in here sometimes with our heads in our hands, because it's just heart-breaking.\"\n\nWe can hear the busy chatter of children in the corridor putting on their home-time coats and wellies. Jamie jerks his thumb towards the noise.\n\n\"We have children in this school who could fly through university, who are as clever as any children in this country, in this world, but they will never get there because of the blockages in the way. They'll never get the opportunity because regardless of all the things we try to do, breaking the cycle that exists in society is impossible. It's heartbreaking.\"\n\nAfter the carol concert, on the hall stage, a tinsel halo and a discarded Christmas jumper are all that remains of Year 5's triumph. In the adjacent dining room, the coloured plastic bowls and beakers for tomorrow's breakfast club have already been laid out in neat lines.\n\nJamie Neadle's phrase still echoes in my ears. \"Someone's got to keep pushing for these children.\"\n\nAll photographs by Alison Baskerville except portrait of Jamie Neadle\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhen Jessica Share bought sperm from a sperm bank in order to start a family, she never imagined that more than a decade later she would meet the donor - and would feel a strong attraction to him.\n\nI met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his child"}]}, "theguardian": {"rss": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/suleimani-killing-donald-trump-defends-threat-to-hit-cultural-sites-in-iran", "published": "2020-01-06T06:11:09", "title": "Suleimani killing: Donald Trump defends threat to hit cultural sites in Iran", "text": "Donald Trump has defended his threat to target Iranian cultural sites \u2013 widely seen as a war crime \u2013 if Tehran retaliates for the killing of General Qassem Suleimani.\n\nOn bellicose form, the US president also lashed out at Iraq following its parliament\u2019s demand for American troops to be expelled from that country, and vowed to respond with crippling sanctions.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments suggest he was making no idle threat when, on Saturday night, he tweeted that the US has \u201ctargeted 52 Iranian sites ... some at a very high level & important to Iran & Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One a day later, he sought to offer a justification. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to kill our people,\u201d Trump said, according to a pool report. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nTargeting cultural sites is prohibited by international conventions signed in Geneva and at the Hague. In 2017, the United Nations security council passed unanimously a resolution condemning the destruction of heritage sites. The action previewed by Trump would almost certainly involve the deaths of civilians.\n\nDiplomacy over Iran is still possible \u2013 if only to avoid an all-out war Read more\n\nTrump\u2019s statements come after secretary of state Mike Pompeo defended the assertion that the drone strike against Suleimani in Baghdad prevented an imminent attack on US interests. \u201cWe would have been culpably negligent had we not taken this action,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. When host Chuck Todd asked if retaliation against US citizens should now be expected, Pompeo admitted: \u201cIt may be that there\u2019s a little noise here in the interim.\u201d\n\nUS-Iran tensions are escalating following last Friday\u2019s drone strike \u2013 ordered by Trump without congressional authorisation \u2013 in Iraq that killed Suleimani, commander of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.\n\nOn Monday morning in Tehran, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei presided over prayers for the slain general, and Suleimani\u2019s daughter Zeinab told a huge crowd at his funeral ceremony that the US and its ally Israel faced a \u201cdark day\u201d for his death.\n\n\u201cCrazy Trump, don\u2019t think that everything is over with my father\u2019s martyrdom,\u201d Zeinab Suleimani said in an address broadcast on state television. \u201cThe families of US soldiers in the Middle East will spend their days waiting for death of their children.\u201d\n\nBefore the ceremony, mourners had packed the streets around Tehran university, chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d. One man held up a placard reading \u201chard\u2013revenge\u201d.\n\nThe ceremony followed a turbulent weekend that saw the Iraqi parliament pass a resolution calling on the government to expel US troops, of which about 5,000 remain, most in an advisory capacity. On Sunday, Iran\u2019s government said the country would no longer observe limitations on uranium enrichment, stockpiles of enriched uranium or nuclear research and development. The statement noted that the steps could be reversed if Washington lifted its sanctions on Tehran.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, Human Rights Watch condemned the president\u2019s latest threat to Iran\u2019s culture sites: \u201cPresident Trump should publicly reverse his threats against Iran\u2019s cultural property and make clear that he will not authorise nor order war crimes,\u201d said Andrea Prasow, its acting Washington director. \u201cThe US Defense Department should publicly reaffirm its commitment to abide by the laws of war and comply only with lawful military orders.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cTrump\u2019s threat to attack Iran\u2019s cultural heritage shows his callous disregard for the global rule of law. Whether refusing to condemn the brutal murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi or pardoning convicted war criminals, Trump has shown little respect for human rights as part of US foreign policy.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump\u2019s drone strike \u201cprovocative and disproportionate\u201d and said legislation would be introduced this week to halt the president\u2019s military actions regarding Iran unless Congress is involved.\n\nShe told Democrats: \u201cWe are concerned that the administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress\u2019s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke to reporters on Sunday as he flew back to Washington from another eventful holiday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. He showed no hint of regret. Asked about vows of vengeance from Iran, the president said simply: \u201cIf it happens it happens. If they do anything, there will be major retaliation.\u201d\n\nHe also turned his ire on Iraq after that country\u2019s parliament passed a resolution calling on the Iraqi government to expel US troops. \u201cWe have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We\u2019re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\n\n\u201cIf they do ask us to leave, if we don\u2019t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they\u2019ve never seen before ever. It\u2019ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks look set to trigger another political firestorm amid concerns that he has not considered the consequences of the strike against Suleimani and may even be seeking to distract from his upcoming impeachment trial.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former US presidential envoy to the global coalition to counter Isis, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s comments tonight regarding Iran and Iraq are not only unacceptable, they\u2019re unAmerican. American military forces adhere to international law. They don\u2019t attack cultural sites. And they\u2019re not mercenaries.

Arquette, accepting for a repeat win as best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, urged viewers to look past the pomp toward real issues. \u201cWhile I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world,\u201d she said. \u201cFor our kids and their kids we have to vote in 2020 and we have to get \u2013 beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.\u201d\n\nWilliams, accepting for best actress in limited series for Fosse/Verdon, built on her memorable Emmys speech on giving space for women to do their best work with a moving call for women\u2019s right to choose. \u201cI\u2019ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me, but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over,\u201d she said \u2013 choices not possible without her right, as a woman, to \u201cchoose when to have my children and with whom, when I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing, as all mothers know, the scales must and will tip towards our children\u201d. She concluded by calling on women \u201c18 to 118\u201d, to vote in their self-interest, because \u201cit\u2019s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them \u2013 but don\u2019t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let\u2019s make it look more like us.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Hanks accepts the Cecil B DeMille award. Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/Associated Press\n\nThe night\u2019s other most resonant speeches belonged to the evening\u2019s two lifetime honorees: Ellen Degeneres, accepting the Carol Burnett award for achievement in television from Kate McKinnon, who described the impact the comedian\u2019s coming out had on her as a young woman, and America\u2019s great everyman, Tom Hanks, introduced for the Cecil B DeMille by Charlize Theron as, simply, a man who \u201cmakes the world a better place\u201d.\n\nPhoenix also took a political, if slightly less coherent than Arquette and Williams, stance in his speech. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice that so many people have sent their well wishes to Australia but we have to do more than that,\u201d he said, referencing the country\u2019s devastating bush fires. \u201cI have not always been a virtuous man. So many of you in this room have given me so many opportunities to get it right \u2026 Together, hopefully we can be unified and make some changes,\u201d such as, he added, not taking a private jet to Palm Springs.\n\nThe climate change-fueled disaster in Australia received much attention throughout the night; best supporting actor in a limited series Russell Crowe wasn\u2019t in attendance due to the fires, sending word instead to take climate action seriously, while Aussie native Cate Blanchett thanked well-wishers and urged for donations to first responders and those affected by the raging bushfires, because \u201cwhen one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster\u201d.\n\nEven Gervais had to agree, ending the night with a call to \u201cget drunk, take your drugs, and also: donate to Australia.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/06/pay-ratios-source-national-shame-high-ftse-boss", "published": "2020-01-06T00:01:14", "title": "Top FTSE bosses paid typical worker's annual salary in just 33 hours", "text": "Senior executives in the UK\u2019s top 100 companies took just 33 hours to be paid more than the typical worker\u2019s annual salary, according to data that unions say should be a \u201csource of national shame\u201d.\n\nFigures released by the High Pay Centre thinktank showed that the typical FTSE 100 chief executive is paid 117 times more than the median worker, at \u00a3901.30 an hour or \u00a33.46m a year.\n\nIt means that by 5pm on 6 January 2020, the chief executives of Britain\u2019s largest listed businesses will have pocketed more than the \u00a329,559 annual salary earned by the median full-time employee, who is taking home about \u00a314.37 an hour.\n\nTim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union, said: \u201cIt should be a source of national shame that in just a handful of days, company fat cats will have made more money than the typical UK full-time worker will earn in the entire year.\n\n\u201cThese empires are built on the back of hardworking staff, many of whom will be struggling to make ends meet.\u201d he\n\nThe pay gap between executives and workers will come under additional scrutiny in the coming months, when individual companies with more than 250 staff will have to publish pay ratios between top earners and the rest of staff in their annual reports for the first time.\n\nPeter Cheese, chief executive at the professional HR body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which analysed pay data for the study, said: \u201cPay ratio reporting will rightly increase scrutiny on pay and reward practices, but reporting the numbers is just the start. We need businesses to step up and justify very high levels of pay for top executives, particularly in relation to how the rest of the workforce is being rewarded.\n\n\u201cGreater fairness and openness in pay is essential in building trust, amongst employees as well as external stakeholders and investors. Expectations on businesses behaving and acting responsibly are rising, and greater transparency around how they are treating and managing all their people is a vital part of building long-term sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe High Pay Centre/CIPD report is based on 2018 data, in which the former Persimmon boss Jeff Fairburn was the highest paid after receiving \u00a339m, plus a controversial \u00a385m bonus. After Fairburn, the Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden was the second highest paid chief executive with a total package of \u00a317.8m.\n\nThe TUC said the latest pay gap figures strengthened an argument for raising taxes on top earners and ensuring staff were given seats on company boards.\n\nLast month the union published a poll showing that 68% of voters \u2013 including the majority of those who voted Conservative \u2013 think that taxes should be raised for those earning more than \u00a380,000 annually.\n\nFrances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThis tells you everything about how unfair our economy is. Every working person plays a part in creating Britain\u2019s wealth. But people at the top are taking more than their share.\n\n\u201cThere should be seats for workers on pay committees and company boards to stop fat cats taking more than their fair share. We also need a fairer tax contribution from those at the top, to help provide our public services the investment they need.\u201d\n\nCriticism of high executive pay comes despite a slight decline in the median executive\u2019s remuneration, from \u00a33.9m to \u00a33.46m, which may fall further following a backlash over pension pay.\n\nA number of the UK\u2019s largest companies, including Britain\u2019s five largest banks, have started to bow to investor pressure over bumper retirement benefits in recent months.\n\nIt comes after politicians, shareholders and City lobby groups agitated for pension payments to be brought in line with the rest of staff.\n\nIn November, Standard Chartered said it would halve the pension allowance of its chief executive, Bill Winter,, which was worth 40% of his salary, to \u00a3237,000 following a shareholder revolt at its AGM in May. Standard Chartered\u2019s UK workers receive a pension worth on average about 10% of their pay.\n\nAndrew Ninian, director of stewardship and corporate governance at the Investment Association, said: \u201cDespite some good progress in the last year on executive pensions, shareholders want companies to ensure that their pay policies are justifiable.\n\n\u201c2020 is an important year, which will see the majority of companies seek shareholder approval for their remuneration policies for the next three years, and they will want to see that CEO pay is proportionate and aligned to performance.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/anti-abortion-activists-increasingly-targeting-uk-university-students", "published": "2020-01-05T18:02:49", "title": "Anti-abortion activists increasingly targeting UK university students", "text": "Anti-abortion campaigners are increasingly targeting students at UK universities, where there has been a rise in the number of anti-abortion societies on campus and demonstrations by outside groups displaying graphic imagery.\n\nThe campaign has gathered momentum on the back of a continuing debate about freedom of speech in universities. Some student unions have been threatened with legal action if they attempt to prevent anti-abortion groups opening on campus.\n\nAccording to the National Union of Students (NUS) there are now at least 14 anti-abortion societies in university students\u2019 unions around the UK, many of which have faced fierce opposition from students who are overwhelmingly pro-choice.\n\nMost recently there have been a series of demonstrations by anti-abortion campaigners outside Cardiff University, which have prompted counter-protests by some students. The rise in tensions followed a vote by the students\u2019 union to adopt an official pro-choice stance, in common with other universities.\n\nIsadora Sinha, a postgraduate student of bioinformatics at Cardiff, proposed the motion which gained overwhelming support when put to a vote in November. Since then there have been at least three anti-abortion protests outside the university, organised by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK (CBR UK), which recently targeted the pro-choice Labour MP Stella Creasy.\n\nThere have been anti-abortion societies at Cardiff students\u2019 union before, but in October a new anti-abortion society opened called Cardiff Students for Life. Its website encourages members to get involved with the wider anti-abortion movement through events such as the annual March for Life and \u201c40 days of life\u201d vigils outside clinics.\n\nSinha said she and other pro-choice activists had received online threats from external parties following the vote and had been in virtual hiding for two weeks. \u201cThe motion was written in a way to ensure free speech and expression for those who are pro-life and the pro-life society can function as before. Unfortunately, there has been backlash against this motion passing despite it having passed by a democratic vote by hundreds of students.\u201d\n\nStudents\u2019 unions at universities including Birmingham, Nottingham, Aberdeen and Strathclyde have been forced to lift bans against anti-abortion groups when faced with possible legal challenges over free speech.\n\nAn organisation called the Alliance of Pro-Life Students (APS) supports students to set up their own anti-abortion societies. It encourages them to affiliate with their students\u2019 unions in order to gain access to facilities, resources, students\u2019 union funding and training opportunities.\n\nThe APS chief executive, Madeline Page, said: \u201cOur societies remain autonomous and students are welcome to run their society as they see as most appropriate to their university\u2019s setting. We do not dictate how they should be run, nor do we run any societies as an organisation.\u201d\n\nWhere legal heft is required, a faith-based legal advocacy group called the Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF International, intervenes to remind universities of their responsibilities to protect freedom of speech, an issue which both the government and the higher education regulator have recently addressed.\n\nDr Pam Lowe, a senior lecturer in sociology and policy at Aston University, researches anti-abortion activism across the UK. \u201cThe anti-abortion movement has collectively recognised they have got an ageing population. They are setting out strategically to try to engage more younger people and get younger people advocating against abortion.\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate policy, that\u2019s quite new. It\u2019s an orchestrated campaign, but where exactly it originates is unclear to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign that it\u2019s really being successful at the moment.\u201d\n\nRachel Watters, the NUS women\u2019s officer, agreed the anti-abortion movement was more visible on campuses, but it did not reflect any change of heart among students. \u201cStudents\u2019 unions and students have been passionate in campaigning about reproductive rights issues for decades.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that recent changes to the law on abortion in Northern Ireland had brought the issue back into focus. \u201cI don\u2019t think the general opinion of students will be massively influenced by the growth of these societies. Anti-choice societies have the right to express their views. Of course, students\u2019 unions, people in the student movement, also have a right to challenge what they are saying.\u201d\n\nKerry Abel, who chairs the campaigning group Abortion Rights, agreed: \u201cAnti-choice campaigners on campus are not new, but their strategies are \u2013 they are becoming more brazen. It\u2019s not acceptable for students\u2019 access to healthcare and information to be blocked or interfered with.\u201d\n\nThe CBR UK chief executive, Andy Stephenson, said anti-abortion activities were being being targeted at students \u201cas universities are attended with people very likely to have an abortion\u201d. He said the demonstrations in Cardiff would continue for the foreseeable future, with protests planned once or even twice a week for the new year. \u201cThe only thing that would make us stop such frequent displays would be the students\u2019 union reversing its advocacy for abortion and mistreatment of pro-life students.\u201d\n\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), said institutions had a duty to provide inclusive and safe environments, and to consider the needs of all students.\n\n\u201cUniversities are places where people can encounter challenging and \u2013 at times \u2013 uncomfortable ideas, and see those ideas questioned, sometimes for the first time. This is something which we should encourage, and the OfS stands for the widest possible definition of free speech. But that challenge must take place in a respectful environment in which civil discourse can thrive.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/harvey-weinstein-trial-new-york-metoo-movement", "published": "2020-01-05T07:00:54", "title": "Weinstein set to face his toughest legal challenge yet in New York trial", "text": "The trial, which begins 6 January, will include testimony from two alleged victims and Annabella Sciorra amid concerns he may not be ultimately held legally accountable\n\nHarvey Weinstein is set to face his toughest legal challenge yet \u2013 a criminal trial for rape and sexual assault that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.\n\nOnly a handful of women will be allowed to testify at the trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan, which begins on 6 January. But watching from the sidelines will be scores of women who have alleged sexual misconduct and abuse at the hands of Weinstein.\n\nIn the New York trial, the 67-year-old movie producer is accused of raping a longtime lover, who has not been publicly named, in 2013, and of forcibly performing oral sex on his production assistant in 2006. The trial will include testimony from these two alleged victims, as well as from Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her at her apartment in the early 1990s.\n\nLisa Bloom on working for Weinstein: \u2018Attorneys represent a lot of distasteful people\u2019 Read more\n\nThe alleged 1993 incident was initially deemed too old to be considered as evidence, but was recently admitted under the legal theory that the testimony could help support charges of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum life sentence and requires prosecutors to show a pattern of misconduct.\n\nThe prosecution will attempt to prove that Weinstein is guilty of all five counts brought before the court, including two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of rape in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. Sciorra\u2019s allegation cannot be charged separately, according to prosecutors.\n\nWeinstein has denied all wrongdoing, saying any sex that took place was consensual.\n\nZo\u00eb Brock, a former model and writer from New Zealand who was part of that civil settlement, told the Guardian that watching proceedings will be agonizing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken that I won\u2019t have the opportunity to face him in court myself. I\u2019m really disappointed. It\u2019s been devastating,\u201d said Brock, who has alleged Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances in a hotel room in 1997, forcing her to lock herself in the bathroom to escape.\n\n\u201cI can definitely paint a picture that he was aided and abetted by people who worked for him, and some of the people who worked for him admitted to my face that he did it repeatedly.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken that I won\u2019t have the opportunity to face him in court myself. I\u2019m really disappointed Zo\u00eb Brock\n\nThe trial comes two years after New York Times and New Yorker investigations into widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by Weinstein helped galvanise the #MeToo era \u2013 and a year after his arrest in 2018, when he was released on $1m bail.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that though Weinstein\u2019s fall from Hollywood royalty to criminal defendant was a watershed cultural moment, he may not ultimately be held legally accountable for most of his alleged conduct.\n\nSuch concerns were heightened in December, following reports that the Weinstein Company had reached a tentative $25m settlement deal in a civil case with more than 30 alleged sexual misconduct victims, which would not require Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing or pay anything out of his own pocket to his accusers.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers insist he is innocent and will only need to sow doubt in the jurors\u2019 minds since it\u2019s up to the prosecution to meet the burden of proof, which is higher for criminal cases than civil ones.\n\n\u201cMr Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false, and he expects to be fully vindicated,\u201d Weinstein lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement.\n\nThe road to the trial has been long and gruelling. In October 2018, Weinstein lawyers got one of six criminal sex charges dismissed. But the defense subsequently failed to get other charges against Weinstein dropped in December 2018, after the judge ruled the court had found \u201cno basis for the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial or law enforcement misconduct\u201d.\n\nLast summer, prosecutors obtained a new indictment allowing for Sciorra to testify \u2013 a move a Weinstein\u2019s lawyers called \u201cdesperate\u201d. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers faced another setback in October when the defense lost its bid to move the trial to another city: the court rejected the former producer\u2019s concern that he wouldn\u2019t get a fair trial in what his lawyers referred to as the \u201ccircus-like atmosphere\u201d of media in New York. Unlike other high-profile court cases in the US, this trial will not be televised.\n\n\ufeff\u201cI\u2019m trying as much as I can to brace myself for the worst possible scenario,\u201d the actor Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to speak out against Weinstein, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd at the same time I feel really hopeful because this is a historic moment and it feels like the message could get out there to people that your stories matter and the judicial system will do something about it.\u201d\n\nKendall came forward as part of the New York Times\u2019 initial investigation into Weinstein, alleging he harassed her in 1993. She has since sought out therapeutic resources, like the trauma workshops led by fellow Weinstein accuser Louise Godbold.\n\n\u201cIf this man walks free it is not just an insult to those of us who have lost friends, families, careers as a result of coming forward with the truth,\u201d Godbold told the Guardian, \u201cbut it is sending a dangerous predator back into the world.\u201d\n\nThe former actor and screenwriter Louisette Geiss emphasized her frustration with the limited scope of the criminal trial. \u201cIn the class action we know of 150 women he\u2019s affected,\u201d Geiss told the Guardian.\n\nA mother to four, Geiss left Hollywood for real estate after she said Weinstein tried to make her to watch him masturbate in front of her as she was pitching a movie at the Sundance film festival in 2008.\n\nShe now serves as co-chair of the $25m civil settlement against Weinstein and the Weinstein Company.\n\n\u201cWe all know that the court of public feelings are very important around these decisions and if he\u2019s seen as this poor guy \u2026 that\u2019s not going to fly,\u201d she said, in reference to his recent media appearances.\n\nWeinstein has begun appearing with a walker, and while recovering from spinal surgery, he granted a rare photo opportunity and interview to the New York Post.\n\n\u201cI feel like the forgotten man,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cI made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I\u2019m talking about 30 years ago.

What our job is, for the next three years, is to hold Boris Johnson to account for all the promises,\u201d she said on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show.\n\n\u201cSo if we are living in an absolute paradise of trade, and we\u2019re totally safe in the world, and we\u2019re not going to worry about having to constantly look to America for our safety and security, then maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. But the reality is that if our country is safer, if it is more economically viable to be in the EU, then I will fight for that, regardless of how difficult that argument is to make.\u201d\n\nHer approach contrasted with the insistence of shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, who was closely associated with Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second Brexit referendum, that it is now time to move on.\n\n\u201cWe are going to leave the EU in the next few weeks; and it\u2019s important for all of us, including myself, to realise that the argument for leave and remain goes with it. We are leaving. We will have left the EU,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis election blew away the argument for a second referendum, rightly or wrongly, and we have to adjust to that situation.\u201d\n\nStarmer said debate would move on to Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, as a non-member. \u201cThe argument now is can we insist on that close relationship with the EU \u2013 close economic relationship but collaboration in other areas \u2013 and also, what is the framework now, for future trade relations?\u201d\n\nNorwich South MP Clive Lewis, who co-founded the Love Socialism Hate Brexit group of Labour MPs, also warned against the risk of rehashing the leave/remain debate in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cThe fight now is about the kind of country we\u2019re going to be,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd if we now spend the next five years or longer looking back, and define our future as rejoining the EU we\u2019ll lose the next stage of this battle, which is about whether we\u2019re going to be an isolationist, inward-looking, xenophobic country, or an outward-looking, progressive, internationalist country.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) will meet at noon on Monday to confirm the rules and timetable for the election, which is expected to be completed by the end of March.\n\nOne NEC source said they were likely to stick with rules thrashed out at Labour\u2019s 2018 annual conference, that will oblige candidates to win the backing of trades unions or local parties, as well as MPs. They may be given just days to secure the necessary 21 nominations from MPs and MEPs.\n\nLeading leftwing candidate Rebecca Long Bailey, who is an NEC member, will not attend the meeting, allies said, amid fears from rival camps of a conflict of interest if she took part.\n\nCampaigning stepped up on Sunday with most contenders making media appearances \u2013 though Long Bailey has so far confined her participation in an article in the Guardian calling for \u201cprogressive patriotism and solidarity\u201d.\n\nFriends said she had taken a break to spend time with her son over Christmas and the new year, but was preparing to launch her candidacy formally this week.\n\nLong Bailey\u2019s close friend Angela Rayner, who had been seen as a potential leadership candidate, will kick off her bid to become Labour\u2019s deputy leader with a speech in Stockport on Tuesday.\n\nAs well as adjusting to Britain\u2019s imminent departure from the EU, the MPs jostling to succeed Corbyn have been setting out their analysis of the party\u2019s poor performance in last month\u2019s general election.\n\nPhillips said Labour\u2019s key problem during the campaign was that voters did not trust it to deliver on its ambitious promises, including free broadband for every household.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental thing is that the country didn\u2019t trust us to govern. It didn\u2019t trust us to deliver on what we were saying,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked what she thought when she saw the free broadband pledge, which was based on a plan to renationalise elements of BT, she said: \u201cWhat I thought was actually what I think lot of people thought, which was I wasn\u2019t sure how we were going to deliver that.\u201d\n\nPhillips also questioned whether the full list of nationalisations promised by the manifesto \u2013 which included mail, water and energy, as well as rail \u2013 should have been Labour\u2019s priority.\n\nOn rail, she said the case had clearly been made; but in other areas, she said the party has to look to \u201chow those services can better serve the public, and nationalisation is one of those ways \u2013 but we have to make choices that people can trust that we will deliver\u201d.\n\nNandy echoed Phillips\u2019s concerns about Labour\u2019s manifesto. \u201cFirst of all I wouldn\u2019t have been offering free broadband,\u201d she told the BBC Radio 5 live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics. \u201cPeople said to us, \u2018It\u2019s all very well promising free broadband but can you sort out the buses?\u2019 and that was the more pressing issue in their lives.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you\u2019re radical or not; it\u2019s about whether you\u2019re relevant.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/croatia-elects-leftist-zoran-milanovic-to-be-next-president", "published": "2020-01-06T00:20:34", "title": "Croatia elects leftist Zoran Milanovi\u0107 to be next president", "text": "Croatia\u2019s leftist former prime minister Zoran Milanovi\u0107, who has pledged to make his nation a more tolerant place and turn the page on its wartime past, will be his country\u2019s next president after defeating the incumbent conservative in a run-off vote.\n\nMilanovi\u0107 took 52.7% of the vote in Sunday\u2019s run-off, while president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, who had tried to unite a fractured right-wing, garnered 47.3%, according to results based on a vote count from nearly all polling stations released by the electoral commission.\n\nThe second-round election was held just days after Croatia took over the European Union\u2019s helm for a six-month period, which will be dominated by Brexit and the bloc\u2019s enlargement.\n\nAt the same time, the EU\u2019s newest member is struggling with a mass exodus of its people, corruption and a lacklustre economy.\n\nGrabar-Kitarovi\u0107 campaigned on a slogan promoting the \u201creal Croatia\u201d, hinting that she believed the ruling conservative HDZ party that backed her was the only one that can truly represent the country.\n\nMilanovi\u0107, a Social Democrat, called such statements \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and advocated a vision of a \u201cnormal Croatia\u201d as a liberal democracy that promoted equality for all citizens.\n\n\u201cFour million of us ... are looking for our place in Europe which is, despite all the problems, the nicest place to live, the most peaceful project in which Croatia must find its place and interest,\u201d Milanovi\u0107 told supporters in Zagreb after his victory.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be united in (our) differences,\u201d the 53-year-old said.\n\nWhy I long for a Croatian passport | Adrian Chiles Read more\n\nIn the campaign Milanovi\u0107 stressed that the \u201cwars are over\u201d, referring to the 1990s independence war that remains an emotive issue.\n\nGrabar-Kitarovi\u0107, 51, the country\u2019s first female president, had tried but failed to lure back hardliners who had voted for a nationalist folk singer in the presidential election\u2019s first round in December.\n\nShe stressed unity, patriotism and references to the 1990s war in her re-election bid.\n\nConceding defeat on Sunday evening, Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 promised a \u201ccivilised transfer\u201d of power to Milanovi\u0107.\n\nShe stressed that Croatia needed stability and unity as \u201cwe are the strongest when we are together\u201d.\n\nAnalysts say that Milanovi\u0107, who dominated in the cities, also won thanks in part to the split among the rightwingers.\n\nThe election was viewed as a key test for the ruling HDZ party of moderate prime minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, ahead of parliamentary elections later this year. Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107\u2019s loss was seen as a heavy blow.\n\nPolitical analyst Tihomir Cipek said the result would weaken the HDZ party and harm Plenkovi\u0107\u2019s reputation,\n\nThe prime minister is also facing the discontent of hardliners within the HDZ over his moderate policies.\n\nGrabar-Kitarovi\u0107 presented herself as a \u201cwoman of the people\u201d with humble farming roots.

Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled.\n\nThe Institute of Student Employers said employers were planning to increase graduate recruitment by just 3%, compared with the 18% rise in graduate vacancies predicted this time last year.\n\nManagers also failed to meet student recruitment targets last year by around 3%, it added. If that pattern persists, the graduate market will be stagnant in 2020, marking the worst graduate jobs growth rate since 2016.\n\nWhile it is not as bleak as the 25% drop in the graduate jobs market seen in 2008/2009, the ISE said it was a sign that employers are hesitant to increase investment in new staff. Stephen Isherwood, the ISE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe graduate jobs market is an early indicator of the health of the economy as employers tend to plan further ahead when deciding their graduate recruitment needs.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe ISE said that a 14% rise in vacancies in the charity and private sectors was the only saving grace for the graduate labour market overall, which would otherwise be at risk of shrinking this year. This is partly due to the government\u2019s plans to increase spending on policing and the NHS.\n\nGrowth in the number of apprenticeship and school leaver programme vacancies also slowed to 2% from 7% last year, suggesting that a spike in openings sparked by the apprenticeship levy may be peaking.\n\nIsherwood said: \u201cOutside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we\u2019ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best. If the government want to see further growth in the apprentice market, they need to address employer concerns about how the apprentice levy works.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/06/burger-kings-new-plant-based-burger-is-not-suitable-for-vegans", "published": "2020-01-06T00:01:14", "title": "Burger King's new plant-based burger is not suitable for vegans", "text": "Burger King has launched its first plant-based burger in the UK, but it is not suitable for vegans because of the way it is cooked.\n\nThe soy-based version of the chain\u2019s Whopper beefburger will be available in UK restaurants from Monday, but is cooked on the same grill as meat, meaning that many non-meat eaters will refuse to eat it.\n\nInstead, the fast-food chain is aiming the new burger, which it has named the Rebel Whopper, at \u201cflexitarians\u201d \u2013 people who eat meat but are reducing their intake of animal products.\n\nToni Vernelli, international head of communications and marketing at Veganuary, a campaign to encourage people to go meat, dairy and egg-free for the month of January, complimented the burger.\n\nHe said that the method of cooking \u201cmakes absolutely no difference\u201d to those trying to cut down meat, but could encourage meat-eaters to lower their consumption.\n\n\u201cWhat does make a big difference to animals and the planet is when non-vegans choose a plant-based menu option, enjoy it and then order it again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly who Burger King\u2019s plant-based Whopper is aimed at, flexitarians who want to reduce their meat consumption for health or environmental reasons, or are considering going vegan.\u201d\n\nThe Vegan Society says veganism is \u201ca plant-based diet avoiding all animal foods such as meat (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and honey\u201d.

She signed off on the repossession of her home in Surrey and moved to London, close to friends, into a \u201cgorgeous, French-style apartment, with flowers and plants everywhere and so much light,\u201d she says, eyes widening. She had 12 months of trauma therapy, which she describes as \u201cthe best gift I ever gave myself\u201d. And she won one of the leading roles in the West End production of the musical City of Angels, which opens in March.\n\nWe meet at a canalside bar in London just before Christmas. \u201cPrior to this year, I\u2019d say I had five of the unhappiest years of my life. Just really tough emotionally,\u201d she says. There was a long period in which an ex-boyfriend harassed and stalked her, which led to his prosecution in 2017, all of which \u201ctook a massive toll on my life\u201d, she says. \u201cI had a few heartbreaks along the way. I was kind of ground down.\u201d Roberts says that just two years ago she would not merely have lacked the confidence to audition for her new role \u2013 \u201cI actually would have been terrified for it to be in the public domain that I was going to be in the same space every night, because I was fearful for my safety\u201d.\n\nIn Josie Rourke\u2019s award-winning production of City of Angels, Roberts plays Avril, an actor, and Mallory, the character Avril is playing. Her acting coach has had to remind her to exaggerate: to make her gestures big enough, declarative enough, to reach the back of the house. Roberts, 34, tiny in a black satin tracksuit, shrinks at the thought. \u201cIt goes against everything in me. I like everything to be natural \u2026 believable.\u201d\n\nThis instinct for subtlety is not synonymous with most pop stars \u2013 particularly pop stars who started out on TV talent shows. But Roberts has always been different. She entered the limelight in 2002, aged 16, by auditioning for the singing competition Popstars: The Rivals while on a family holiday after her GCSEs. She became the youngest member of the band Girls Aloud, who won the show. They went on to have 21 Top 10 singles, including four No 1s; two of their five albums topped the charts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest (Left to right) Sarah Harding, Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Cheryl and Kimberley Walsh of Girls Aloud in 2002. Photograph: balkanpix.com/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nRoberts was one of the group\u2019s most recognisable faces, known as the alternative one, set apart from the other four not only by her red hair and pale skin, but by her measuredness and taste. She was often described by interviewers as \u201csulky\u201d or \u201creserved\u201d.\n\nThere were health difficulties \u2013 hypoglycaemia and anaemia \u2013 exacerbated by the gruelling performance schedule. And there was grotesque bullying over her appearance. When Matt Willis from the band Busted called her a \u201crude ginger bitch\u201d in 2003, she made a stand, painting his words on a skirt, then performing in it. In 2007, Lily Allen called her \u201cthe ugly one\u201d from Girls Aloud, while Chris Moyles, who was then a BBC Radio 1 DJ, insulted Roberts for years, calling her the \u201cropey-looking ginger one\u201d, \u201chorsey chops\u201d and a \u201csour-faced old cow\u201d. (Moyles made a non-apology in 2012.)\n\nToday, Roberts downplays the impact on her self-esteem, but she marvels at how beauty standards have changed. In 2008, she launched a makeup line, Dainty Doll, to cater for those with a pale complexion. \u201cI struggled all the time to find makeup that was light enough,\u201d she says. The palest available shade would be \u201cfive shades too dark \u2013 but, again, that was because of beauty trends at the time. People weren\u2019t pale. Everyone was on the sunbed and using fake tan ... It\u2019s just crazy now, isn\u2019t it, to think that?\u201d\n\nEarly in her career, Roberts had tried sunbeds. But after presenting a BBC Three documentary about the health risks in 2010, she joined the then Labour MP Julie Morgan\u2019s campaign to ban under-18s from using them; the law was introduced the following year.\n\nFor Roberts, the legacy of Girls Aloud is her friendships with her bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl (with whom she continues to collaborate; she co-wrote Cheryl\u2019s recent singles). \u201cKimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 there\u2019s such a deep thread there. We\u2019ve gone through everything together. Everything.\u201d\n\nThe group went on hiatus in 2009 to allow each member to pursue solo projects. Roberts changed management, ended a six-year relationship and experienced a sort of delayed adolescence. She also released her debut solo album, Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, in 2011, informed by her struggles to fit in. It was widely acclaimed by critics for its musical idiosyncrasies and lyrical insight \u2013 in the ballad Sticks + Stones, Roberts sang of \u201cbeing told I\u2019m ugly, over and over\u201d and pleading with her driver to buy her vodka to help her cope.\n\nKimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 we\u2019ve gone through everything together\n\nThe band split for good in 2013, after their 10th-anniversary tour, and Roberts was finally outside the long-standing group dynamic. Roberts has always been \u201cemotionally independent\u201d, something she credits to being the eldest sibling of four. \u201cI just handle everything myself,\u201d she says. But she was forced to accept the limits of that approach when she was stalked by a former partner. From 2012 to 2017, Carl Davies \u2013 an ex-soldier Roberts dated seriously before an acrimonious split in 2008 \u2013 sent Roberts thousands of messages over Twitter and Instagram, including some that were described in court as \u201cviolent and threatening\u201d. Davies also sent proclamations of love and had flowers delivered to Roberts\u2019 manager\u2019s office.\n\nRoberts never replied, but she documented 3,000 messages over five years, only going to the police in 2017 when Davies started contacting her friend, the R&B singer Joel Compass. For a long time, Roberts says, her approach to the harassment had been to \u201cprocess it and process it and process it myself \u2026 until it just became explosive\u201d. She wrote in her victim impact statement that the messages had been a reminder of \u201call the terrible things\u201d in her relationship with Davies: \u201cIt was like walking on eggshells.\u201d\n\nIn May 2017, Davies admitted one count of stalking and another of persistent use of public communication networks to cause annoyance or inconvenience, for which he was handed a 15-month suspended prison sentence (meaning he served no time). He was also given a lifetime restraining order, prohibiting him from contacting or approaching Roberts or any member of her family. His defence said Davies had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Afghanistan and noted that Roberts had not told him to stop sending the messages.\n\nJust a few months after his sentencing, Davies was accused of breaching the restraining order by following Roberts on Instagram \u2013 but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges on the advice that there was little chance of a conviction. In 2018, the CPS apologised for that decision, which Roberts\u2019 lawyer said reflected a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about social media.\n\nRoberts says of the apology now: \u201cIt was too late. That\u2019s the first time in my whole life, I am extremely fortunate to say, that I ever felt [I\u2019d been done] an injustice because I was a woman ... I felt genuinely begrudged, like something extremely unfair was placed upon me, because I was a woman. And it was a horrible feeling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberts (centre) on stage with Girls Aloud in 2005. Photograph: Dave Etheridge-Barnes/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think sometimes certain behaviour of men is seen as normal or usual \u2013 but it\u2019s never normal or usual to the victim, ever. It\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nDoes she have any closure now? \u201cIt\u2019s behind me in my everyday life, and that has been a blessing. It\u2019s behind me in that I don\u2019t have, like, a paranoia that I had before. I don\u2019t feel scared.\u201d\n\nWhen the messages started, anticipation was high for a follow-up to Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, but years of fearing for her safety took a \u201cmassive toll\u201d on Roberts\u2019 confidence. \u201cTo have these bloody messages, life-threatening messages, every day \u2013 it just ground me down. I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m being creative, with a project to work on \u2013 but I just couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d sit with the pen and go to write and I\u2019d be like: \u2018This. Is. Shiiit.\u2019 Like: \u2018I can\u2019t get out of me what I want to get out.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo changes enabled her to move on. The first was \u201cgetting out of that house\u201d in Surrey, where she had felt so afraid. In October, she signed off on the repossession of the \u00a31.25m home; she had been trying to sell it since 2017, slashing the price to \u00a3825,000.\n\nRoberts says now that she was \u201cscared to be there\u201d. \u201cIt was a prison \u2013 a horrible, horrible prison \u2026 I\u2019d just had enough.\u201d Moving to London, closer to her friends, has made a \u201cmassive contribution\u201d to her happiness.\n\nBut most transformative was her year of trauma therapy. Before this, Roberts says, she had a tendency to put her feelings in a box, then set them to one side. \u201cIt got to a point where I was compartmentalising everything \u2026 the box just got full.\u201d She laughs, before continuing. \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want this to affect me any more \u2013 it is my responsibility to make me happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn therapy, there was no way of separating out the different parts of her life and herself. She draws a parallel with getting a neck massage: \u201cThey start doing your back and you\u2019re like: \u2018I don\u2019t want my back done,\u2019 and they\u2019re like: \u2018Well, you gotta do your neck to do your back, y\u2019know?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe opened all the boxes. I feel like it\u2019s just changed me in the most amazing way, for ever.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Roberts\u2019 song Sticks + Stones.\n\nIn the past, Roberts was \u201ca fixer\u201d in relationships \u2013 not any more, she says. She has developed her boundaries. \u201cIt means that you take all the red flags that pop up extremely seriously and you turn around and walk the other way, straight away. Things that maybe you would tolerate before, or things that you would [explain away and] be like: \u2018Oh, you know, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ...\u2019\n\n\u201cI have been too unhappy and I am now so happy \u2013 I will never let anything disrupt that. So unless you are continuing with me in this happy, peaceful state, you\u2019re not getting near me.\u201d\n\nRoberts is single now, but open to a relationship with the right person. The bar is set high. \u201cI don\u2019t like the feeling of being unhappy.

She won\u2019t be drawn on specifics, but she says she and Ball have known each other for years and that he had commented on how \u201ccalm and different\u201d she seemed. \u201cAnd I could honestly say: \u2018Yeah \u2013 I just feel happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts says that, perhaps for the first time, she is gaining weight. \u201cI have boobs, I have a bum,\u201d she says delightedly. \u201cI threw out 17 pairs of jeans \u2013 can\u2019t get them past my thighs.

Photograph: John Pedersen\n\nPlan: Take as many trees as I can to the Dordogne\n\nI have 25 acres of land by the Dordogne. No house there, just the land. I built a tiny cabin on it. I\u2019m there spring and autumn planting a forest garden. I\u2019ve been propagating trees here [in the UK] and taking them to France to plant out. All sorts of things: pomegranates, peaches, nectarines, walnuts and lots of rootstocks I can graft apples and pears and so on on to. This will be the last year I\u2019ll be able to so freely take my trees over the border.\n\nAfter Brexit, I\u2019ll almost certainly need a phytosanitary certificate for each species of tree. Completely unaffordable at my scale of operation. So I\u2019ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I\u2019ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I\u2019m not there all the time.\n\nI might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they\u2019ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits. For some of the people I\u2019ve got to know in the business, Brexit will be a disaster, as some of them sell the great majority of their plants to the EU.\n\nEmma (name changed)\n\nUnemployed and disabled\n\nPlan: Get an electric wheelchair in the EU\n\nI will continue my discrimination claim against the government body that I worked for, using the fair laws from the EU that cover workers\u2019 rights before they are rewritten and possibly withdrawn by the Tories to exclude holiday pay or disability support.\n\nI\u2019d love to visit some more EU countries, but as my NHS wheelchair provider has been privatised, I need to fund \u00a36,000 for the electric wheelchair suggested by said provider before I can leave the house independently or at least with minimal support. Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider.\n\nI think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum\u2019s family are Irish immigrants, but it\u2019s OK because she voted Tory as she says, \u201cWe have too many immigrants in this country.\u201d\n\nI might also look for a new, less xenophobic family.\n\nFergal (name changed), 63, Dumfries\n\nConsultant surgeon\n\nI am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer.

However, my priority is now leaving Britain for good.\n\nI have been making the most of freedom of movement since the age of 18: I have Interrailed and travelled extensively, studied at a French university, worked in France as a tour guide, worked as a holiday representative in Spain, worked in a hostel in Budapest.\n\nI\u2019m using my last year of freedom of movement, as a British citizen at least, to become a legal resident of Germany and then hopefully one day regain the rights I am about to loose due to Brexit.\n\nThanks to Brexit, I won\u2019t be able to easily keep doing the seasonal work I love doing, because the likelihood of receiving a work permit as a non EU national is slim to none. I think it\u2019s a great shame because I have lived, worked and studied in three other countries already at the age of 21, all without hassle due to freedom of movement.

I have not lived in the UK since May 2003 and to have to return would be a personal tragedy. My life is here, I have no connection with the UK. I will never go to Britain of my own volition.\n\nApart from this, we hope to start a collective of musicians and artists to challenge the destructive myths of our society. We live in a society whose dominant narratives, of human centrality on the Earth, social and technological progress, endless growth,the primacy of the individual \u2026 these stories no longer have any basis in reality, and no longer equip us to deal with the political and ecological challenges of the new century.\n\nThus, the next challenge, the most pertinent and urgent, must be to reinvent our cultural narratives to reflect our new situation. In the Netherlands we still have some hope that we can avoid our government being taken over by corporate-sponsored ethnic nationalists.\n\nTo my fellow British-Europeans: I\u2019m sorry for how things worked out for you. Don\u2019t give up, but reevaluate, because a narrative which claims our current economic and political institutions can continue with minor progressive-oriented adjustments is no longer convincing, and will become less so as ecological and social disasters occur with ever greater frequency.\n\nGood luck.\n\nSofiya Cox, student, Aberdeen\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sofiya Cox Photograph: Sofiya Cox\n\nPlan: get funding for an Erasmus period of study elsewhere in the EU\n\nI would like to pursue a postgraduate degree abroad, somewhere that is cheaper than in the UK. After three years of my undergraduate degree in Scotland, a place where an English-registered student still has to pay \u00a39,000 a year, with classes bountiful with European students who pay less than I have for the same teaching and degree classification, I am looking for a bargain.\n\nBy being treated like a customer of higher education in the UK, I am looking for a place that will observe my academic ability more than what I (don\u2019t) have in my pockets. As a student of Politics and IR [International Relations], the debates around the political landscape in the future are coloured. They are 50 shades of uncertainty. Higher Education in the UK could do without this.

There\u2019s nothing left for the younger generation in this country. I\u2019m not 100% sure which EU country I will move to, but it\u2019ll most likely be Portugal.

I\u2019m old enough to remember the lies we were told when given our first opportunity of stating if we wanted to stay in the straitjacket that has now transformed from a trading partnership to a one size fits all conglomerate of now 27 countries all running very expensive home parliaments that have no ability to govern as they have no overall rights any more.\n\nThe biggest disaster to date was the introduction of the one size fits all euro, who says so? The very man whose idea it was in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t argue with him as Im not qualified to do. He\u2019s the professor of economics and recognised for it not me. I have carried out more reading on this one subject over the past four years than on any one single subject and therefore feel I take a balanced view.

This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. \u201cEverything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,\u201d said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty\u2019s technical operations manager in Dublin.\n\nBut there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland\u2019s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views).\n\nBy 2028 data centres and other large users will consume 29% of Ireland\u2019s electricity, according to EirGrid, Ireland\u2019s state-owned transmission system operator. Worldwide data centres consume about 2% of electricity, a figure set to reach 8% by 2030. Few countries, if any, will match Ireland\u2019s level.\n\nIt is already Europe\u2019s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Digital Realty\u2019s Ben Bryan and Valerie Walsh at the company\u2019s site in Grange Castle, Dublin. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian\n\nIt is just the beginning. With the state\u2019s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned \u20ac850m (\u00a3743m) centre last year.\n\n\u201cThe data centre industry is growing so fast it\u2019s hard to fathom,\u201d said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. \u201cBut somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.\u201d\n\nIreland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d, facilitating planning approval. \u201cData centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI).\n\nBut the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU\u2019s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than \u20ac250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines.\n\nA report by the Irish Academy of Engineering (IAE) has estimated data centre expansion will require almost \u20ac9bn in new energy infrastructure and add at least 1.5m tonnes to Ireland\u2019s carbon emissions by 2030 \u2013 up 13% spike on current electricity sector emissions.\n\nIreland\u2019s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Google\u2019s data centre in Grange Castle. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian\n\nDigital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation.\n\nIt powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power \u2013 and cooling \u2013 stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof.\n\nThe electricity came from 100% renewable sources, said Valerie Walsh, a company vice-president. \u201cThere is a huge amount of thought to make sure we\u2019re sustainable and do the right thing.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by \u2013 or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork.\n\nSuch deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report.\n\nAsked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: \u201cThe department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.\u201d\n\nBresnihan, the academic, said Ireland\u2019s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. \u201cIf they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there\u2019s only so long you can put off these contradictions.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/doctor-who-recap-series-38-episode-two-spyfall-part-two", "published": "2020-01-05T20:00:09", "title": "Doctor Who recap: series 38, episode two \u2013 Spyfall part two", "text": "Where were the Bond antics?

And yet Spyfall part two collapsed under the weight of its own bombast mere moments after those words were uttered. I complained last series about the seemingly pedestrian nature of this new Doctor Who compared with the more bonkers moments of Steven Moffat\u2019s pomp. Now, that feels like a case of careful what you wish for. Sure, the second instalment of Spyfall was a riot, but riots are supposed to at least be explicable. There was little of that on display here.\n\nNormally I would kick off with a recap of how they all got off the doomed aircraft, but even Graham, Ryan and Yaz were as clueless about that as the rest of us. Along the way, we took several trips to the White Light Nuns\u2019 spooky netherworld, teamed up (for no discernible reason) with computer pioneers Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage and took a trip back to the second world war where Hot Camp Master was disguising himself as a German soldier.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The \u2018fam\u2019 were as clueless as the rest of us ... Yaz. Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBC\n\nAside from killing his mother, Lenny Henry was barely to be seen after being hyped up as the Big Bad, though the Big Bad Tech through-line was laid on with a trowel to make up for his character\u2019s lack of screen time. Meanwhile, the \u201cfam\u201d also spent most of the episode similarly missing in action. I was left wondering what did happen this week, other than a trip to burning Gallifrey and another back in time for tea. And, other than the odd trick with a laser shoe, there was barely a Bond trope in sight either. A befuddling instalment.\n\n\u2018When does all this stop for you?\u2019\n\nThe relationship between the Doctor and the Master is among the most storied in Doctor Who lore. Once best friends at the Timelord Academy, the two took, as Thirteen puts it, \u201cvery different paths\u201d and have been each other\u2019s missing piece since the character was introduced in the 1970s. Had actor Roger Delgado survived, there were bigger plans for the Master that never came to pass. He appeared intermittently in the intervening years (played most notably by Anthony Ainley and John Simm) but never really caught fire again until s/he was rebooted and regendered as Missy, played by Michelle Gomez. Missy\u2019s story turned out to be one of redemption, but Chris Chibnall seems to be ignoring the notion of the Doctor\u2019s best frenemy having \u201cgone good\u201d. Hot Camp Master is not showing much in the way of redeeming features thus far. But there is still an awful lot to play for.\n\nLife aboard the Tardis\n\nNot much to see here officer. Too much else going on.\n\nFear factor\n\nThe White Light Nuns are named as the Kasarven \u2013 though neither Lenny Henry nor the Master seem to have any say over how to handle them after all the buildup. We don\u2019t even get much of a glimpse of their true nature \u2013 yet another crucial element to sink without enough screen time. They\u2019re probably not a long-term returning monster, I would wager.\n\nMysteries and questions\n\nIf one thing is at least clear, it\u2019s that something is afoot when it comes to the long game. We enjoyed a somewhat unexplained visit to Gallifrey to watch in horror the as the Citadel burned. Hot Camp Master admitted culpability, before expanding on his warning from last week that \u201ceverything you think you know is a lie\u201d. He then denounced the founding fathers of Gallifrey as traitors amid \u201cthe lie of the Timeless Child\u201d.

But his artistic response to the forced sterilisation programme he underwent in Nazi Germany, a bundle of leaves flimsily held together in a worn leather cover, is receiving growing recognition in the art world almost eight decades after his death.\n\nThe detailed sketches, like scenes from a puppet show, are believed to be the only works of art by one of the 400,000 people who suffered forced sterilisation under the Nazis\u2019 programme to eliminate \u201cundesirables\u201d.\n\nThe sketch book is to be the focal point of a major permanent collection of so-called outsider art \u2013 at the Prinzhorn gallery in Heidelberg, southern Germany from May.\n\n\u201cThese drawings are immensely precious both historically and artistically,\u201d says Thomas R\u00f6ske, art historian and director of the Prinzhorn, which owns Werner\u2019s drawings in its collection of 6,000 works by patients of psychiatric institutions, dating back to 1840 and the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\u201cMost work produced by patients was destroyed during the Nazi period,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pencil drawing by Werner. Photograph: Prinzhorn gallery\n\nThat Werner\u2019s works survived, he believes, is nothing short of a miracle. \u201cThere are some writings and poems of patients from this era but as far as we know no drawings.\u201d\n\nAn administrator at the Werneck asylum in southern Germany where Werner spent most of his life saved the book, regularly showing it to friends, and when he died several years ago his family sold it to the Prinzhorn.\n\nMarc Steene, director of Outside In, a UK-based charity that aims to provide a platform for artists largely excluded from the art world because of health, disability or social reasons, encountered Werner\u2019s works for the first time three years ago during a research residency at the Prinzhorn.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awful normality to Werner\u2019s drawings,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are a potent mix of what was happening to him and what he created out of that. He is like the director of his own awful play.\u201d He included two sketches in a show he curated at the Lightbox in Woking, The Outside and the Inside. The works of Werner have a particular poignancy, he says, viewed in the context of the many pieces of art by institutionalised artists that are often destroyed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pencil drawing by Werner. Photograph: Prinzhorn gallery\n\n\u201cI worked at a care centre in Brighton 30 years ago where I was struck by the artistic intuition and talent of those who came there. When I went back to get some of the works framed, I was told they had been pulped,\u201d Steene says. \u201cThe reality is that most works produced by people in similar situations ends up in landfill sites, deemed worthless.\u201d\n\nR\u00f6ske says that many medical files from before and during the Nazi era document the fact that patients often worked artistically. \u201cTypical are comments by doctors in their notes, that say: \u2018he or she makes nice drawings\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the thought of keeping them was rarely considered worthwhile.\u201d\n\nWerner\u2019s drawings are all that remain of his existence. It is only due to strict German bureaucracy that the scantest of details about his life are known.\n\nBorn on 18 September 1898, he was without a profession, unmarried, Catholic and diagnosed with idiocy. Analysis of his drawings suggest he was probably left-handed. But there is no birth certificate, no photograph and his medical file has been lost, probably destroyed. There is only the registration number HHSTAW Abt.631a, Nr 1645, assigned to him at the age of 42, when he was in a group of 143 people \u2013 mainly women \u2013 who were transported to Pirna Sonnenstein asylum near Dresden on 6 October, 1940 and murdered in its gas chambers as part of the Nazis\u2019 \u201cAction T4\u201d extermination programme.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pencil drawing by Werner. Photograph: Prinzhorn gallery\n\nR\u00f6ske\u2019s attempts to discover more about Werner took him back to the town of Nordheim am Main, where he had lived with his mother in the poorhouse. Residents there still remembered talk of the boy who was \u201cnot right in the head\u201d, and who was forbidden to play with younger children, he says.\n\n\u201cBut we have found nothing to back up the diagnosis of idiocy,\u201d R\u00f6ske added. \u201cThat would mean a mental age of two to four, whereas we have here someone who was able to write (some of the drawings are annotated), who had an imagination and developed an individual way of telling his story. It\u2019s clear that drawing was his world and he had developed a style and had inhabited that world for a long time.\u201d\n\nBerlin recreates Nazi-baiting art exhibition from 1938 Read more\n\nThe drawings show scenes from the clinic, including meetings between doctors and nurses. Round clowns depict the patients as they undergo surgery or juggle testicles. The nurses smoke, with swastika bands around their arms as they handle the patients\u2019 testicles. Twice, Werner refers to a Dr Weinzierl. Hans Weinzierl was head surgeon in a hospital in Schweinfurt where compulsory sterilisations were carried out, even though there is no evidence that he was involved. Although the artist\u2019s sympathy is clearly with the patients, the pictures are often ambiguous, R\u00f6ske says, with \u201cthe authority figures exuding an air of matter-of-fact authority\u201d.\n\nWerner also depicts sterilisation as a literal castration, R\u00f6ske says, whereas the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring only stipulated that patients should be made infertile. \u201cBut he seems to have understandably viewed the surgery as a brutal emasculation,\u201d R\u00f6ske says, \u201chence his frequent use of the motif of removed testicles and drawings of the sterilisation instruments, as he imagined them.\u201d\n\nIn arguably his most striking drawing, entitled The Triumph of Sterelation (as he referred to sterilisation), R\u00f6ske says it is still not clear to him if Werner was \u201cmaybe being sarcastic or trying to develop a humouristic fantasy about suffering for a \u2018good cause\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe drawing shows inmates of the clinic being transported on a bus decorated with swastika flags while on its roof a nurse displays two testicles on a plate. \u201cHe might well have been aware of the propaganda vehicles that drove through Nazi Germany advertising the party\u2019s slogans and could well have been referencing them,\u201d R\u00f6ske says.\n\nOn the inside of the book cover, Werner refers to himself as an \u201corator of the people\u201d and a \u201ctheatre director\u201d.\n\nSteene says: \u201cIt\u2019s rather wonderful.

A lot more. This holds true over time and across cultures. In America, the incarceration capital of the world (over 2 million detainees), males comprise 93% of the prison population. Men also account for 73% of all arrests and 80% of those charged with violent crimes. This disparity between the sexes is particularly stark when it comes to murder: 90% of the time, the ones who do the killing are men.\n\nAll these numbers add up to what criminologists call the \u201cgender gap\u201d. But read enough academic journals and government crime reports, and some curious facts emerge: while crime rates in the western world have steadily declined over the past three decades, the number of young women being convicted for violent crimes in some western countries has increased significantly; law enforcement records indicate the opposite is true for their male counterparts. In other words, the gender gap is closing.\n\nIn some UK cities, the number of female arrests increased by 50% from 2015 to 2016. That\u2019s more than a blip. A 2017 report by the Institute For Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London came up with this sobering data point: the global female prison population has surged by more than half since the turn of the century, while the male prison population increased by just a fifth over that same period. Women and girls may account for only 7% of all incarcerated people today, but their numbers are now growing at a much faster rate than at any time in recorded history.\n\nKelly Paxton, a Portland, Oregon-based private investigator known to news producers as the Pink Collar Crime Lady, says she isn\u2019t surprised that female arrest rates are going up: \u201cWomen suddenly have the financial pressures that men have had for decades. They\u2019re the breadwinners in 40% of all households. If these women can\u2019t pay the bills, some will resort to committing crimes.\u201d\n\nThe new crime trend hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. The National Herald ran this story last month: Greek cops nab teen girl pickpocket ring in Athens. And here\u2019s a recent BBC News headline: Sharp rise in women caught carrying knives (up 73% in the past five years). Even InSight Crime, a not-for-profit that studies organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, is all-in. One of their recent reports sounds like a Netflix elevator pitch: Female prisoners in Venezuela become cell block bosses to survive.\n\nWhat\u2019s really cemented this pulpy women-behind-bars image in the collective conscious, though, is Crime Has No Gender, a controversial Europol campaign that launched last August. \u201cAre women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men?\u201d reads the news release. \u201cThe female fugitives featured on Europe\u2019s Most Wanted website prove that they are.\u201d\n\nAre women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men? The female fugitives featured on Europe's Most Wanted website prove that they are\n\nTo show that women can be vicious sociopaths too, Europol asked 21 of the 28 EU member countries to select a single fugitive for their campaign. The methodology may have been flawed, and the sample size small, but the gimmick worked. The bad girls theme was reflected in the head count: 18 females, three males. Elena Puzyrevich (Russia), who trafficked nine young women into Spain and forced them to work as prostitutes, made the list. So did Dorota Kazmierska (Poland), a 44-year-old femme fatale who killed her husband by shooting him in the head. Then there\u2019s Zorka Rogic (Croatia), a blonde desperado who works in sales: narcotics, \u201cpsychotropic substances\u201d, firearms, munitions and explosives.\n\nDocumenting the rise in female crime is one thing. Explaining it is quite another. Cesare Lombroso, the Italian physician known as the \u201cfather of modern criminology\u201d (he invented the first lie detector) also wrote the first book about women and crime, La Donna Delinquente in 1893. He concluded that women who broke the law exhibited crude male traits. The profile was simple: short, lusty, vulgar and prone to wrinkles. They also had darker hair and smaller skulls than \u201cnormal\u201d women. A Lombroso dating tip: beware of girls with prominent lower jaws \u2013 they\u2019re likely to commit crimes of passion.\n\nFreud also thought criminal women were more like men. Sort of. He blamed female crime on a \u201cmasculinity complex\u201d, which could be traced back to (of course) penis envy. Most women resolved this complex and developed into law-abiding citizens. Others, however, fared worse. Instead of embracing femininity, these women over-identified with males and coveted their floppy organs. Think of a woman who smiles while she stabs her husband to death in bed, and later cleans the sheets.\n\nBiology and psychology theories are still discussed in criminology classes today. Studies that link the menstrual cycle to female crime have persisted for decades. According to the three female authors of The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation, the 19th century axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because \u201cher period coincided with an epileptic attack\u201d. Psychology models, of course, continue to be popular. Behavioral theory suggests that becoming a criminal requires conditioning, a form of learning that involves positive reinforcement: rob a bank, spend the money, rob another bank.\n\nAccording to three female authors axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because \"her period coincided with an epileptic attack\"\n\nIncreasingly, though, many of today\u2019s gender gap theories focus on external factors, like tougher drug sentencing laws (25% of women in US state prisons have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 14% of male prisoners) and the proliferation of violent female gangs (the Bad Barbies, an all-girls \u201csister gang\u201d, with chapters in Harlem and Brooklyn, have pulled off multiple revenge murders). There\u2019s also the post-conviction barriers that uniquely affect women and lead to recidivism: prison guard abuse, few mental health services and a lack of job training. Police, lawyers and judges being less protective toward women is another reason criminologists believe the gender gap is shrinking.\n\nWe should\u2019ve seen this coming. In 1975, the famous criminologist Freda Adler trumpeted this warning in her bombshell book Sisters In Crime: The Rise of the New Female Criminal: \u201cIn the same way that women are demanding equal opportunity in the fields of legitimate endeavor, a similar number of determined women are forcing their way into the world of major crimes.\u201d\n\nForty-five years later, Adler\u2019s feminist manifesto still resonates. Just try finding a criminologist who doesn\u2019t own a dog-eared copy. Critics may argue that her prediction was wrong (the \u201970s women\u2019s lib movement didn\u2019t breed a vast army of females toting guns and flashing armpit hair), but Adler was onto something. More women are committing violent crimes. It just took longer than she expected.\n\nThe most intriguing academic paper that explores the women behaving badly phenomenon is the 2017 essay The Gender Gap In Crime Is Decreasing, But Who\u2019s Growing Equal To Whom? Rejecting Adler\u2019s gender equality theory, the authors offer a reverse hypothesis: the real reason that the gender gap is shrinking isn\u2019t because women are copying the behavior of men and committing more crimes \u2013 it\u2019s because men are copying the behavior of women and committing fewer crimes. The idea that feminism might be making our mean streets safer may sound absurd to a beat cop, but the theory is being hotly debated among criminologists and gender studies scholars at liberal arts colleges.\n\nThe Pink Collar Crime Lady has her own gender gap theory, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with feminism, chivalrous judges or menstrual cycles. \u201cWomen nurture and raise us. We love and trust them,\u201d explains Kelly Paxton. \u201cSo being a female crook is the perfect cover.\u201d Then she shares some insider wisdom: \u201cThe first thing I tell clients is never underestimate a woman.

It was all clear by 5am on 13 December, in that great swath of once-safe Labour seats taken by the Conservatives, crudely understood as being leave-supporting, post-industrial and largely working class: Bolsover, Bishop Auckland, Bridgend, Great Grimsby, Durham North West, Wakefield, Wrexham, Bassetlaw.\n\nIn the three weeks since they turned blue, there has been a lot of talk about how places so ill-served by Tory governments could have elected Conservative MPs, but that misses a crucial point. Our convoluted electoral system has long ensured that the most reliable way a place can get political attention is by being part of a marginal constituency. And however it has happened, all those seats that were once solid parts of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d have now pulled this off, propelling themselves to the heart of the national conversation.\n\nGiven the Tories\u2019 responsibility for the dire inequalities of the last 40 years, the natural reaction might be to scoff\n\nIn that sense, a new decade marks the start of a completely new political model. At its heart will be people such as the man I met on election night in Tunstall, one of the six towns that make up Stoke-on-Trent, where all three parliamentary seats are now held by the Tories. He answered the door to Labour canvassers and said he had just voted Conservative for the first time in his life. How did that feel? \u201cNot good, really,\u201d he told me. For the foreseeable future, politics will be full of the questions that lurked in that brief conversation. Can such voters be turned into enthusiastic Tories? Will Labour win them back? And in the course of the resulting battle, how will things change on the ground?\n\nOver the Christmas break I dug out an old article from the Times, published towards the end of Tony Blair\u2019s time in power. Its author had got hold of Labour research that emphasised how, back then, elections were still decided by much the same people who held sway in the 1980s: \u201cyoung families with mortgages, working in the private sector in technical white collar or highly skilled manual work\u201d and \u201cself-employed workers with small businesses\u201d, clustered in the south-east, the more affluent areas of the Midlands and towns and cities such as Bristol, Milton Keynes, Swindon and Gloucester.\n\nWe all know what the privileging of such voters meant in practice: they were understood by both main parties as wanting to hold the post-Thatcher settlement intact, and keep government intervention in the economy (and their taxes) to a minimum, and yet somehow still be confident of well-funded public services. During the David Cameron years the same voters were held to accept the wisdom of austerity but also to be socially liberal and support his attempts to modernise his party.\n\nIf Labour is ever to form a majority government, people and places like these will still be crucial. But the party is first going to have win back rather different voters in its lost heartlands. For the Tories, meanwhile, post-Brexit hegemony now depends on the support of traditionally Labour-supporting areas that have long relied on the welfare state and public sector, and have stuck with communitarian values that post-Thatcher Conservatives never seemed to understand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The inescapable realities of a redrawn political map.\u2019 Flags on display in a residential tower block, Stoke-on\u2013Trent. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe mantra \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, and hostile Tory noises about immigration and crime and punishment, are part of the drive to keep these places onside, but what they fundamentally require from politicians is much more onerous: since the 2016 referendum, large parts of the country have been demanding serious economic change, now long overdue.\n\nLast week I had a long conversation with a senior minister. As surprising as it may sound, he insisted that some very prominent strands of Conservative thinking were now in retreat. Unprompted, he mentioned an infamous free-market tract co-written by some of the people he serves alongside. \u201cThings like Britannia Unchained, and those past Conservative plans to remodel the NHS \u2013 that\u2019s all off the agenda,\u201d he said. He talked about \u201cproblems with the capitalism we\u2019ve had over the last three decades\u201d, and the sense that \u201csome of the things we\u2019ve celebrated have led us astray\u201d.\n\nThere was mention of big employers who \u201cdon\u2019t have a sense of being rooted in the community\u201d, and one of the most overlooked challenges faced by countless places: how to develop parts of the country that have fallen behind, and how to encourage people who\u2019ve left to find opportunity elsewhere to come home.\n\nGiven the Tories\u2019 deep responsibility for the dire inequalities and imbalances that have befallen Britain over the last 40 years, the natural reaction may be to scoff. Seeking a crumb of comfort from last month\u2019s drubbing, some on the left might claim that credit for these shifts lies with Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. In fact, such ideas have been bubbling away in Conservative politics for the best part of a decade, as evidenced by sporadic talk about \u201cblue-collar conservatism\u201d, Theresa May\u2019s fleeting embrace of the \u201cjust about managing\u201d, and the kind of approaches long associated with the estranged Tory grandee Michael Heseltine. Johnson himself has reportedly told the cabinet that he now sees himself as \u201cbasically a Brexity Hezza\u201d.\n\nObviously, plenty of things are likely to remain exactly as they are, from the cruelties of the benefits system to the decay of vitalcouncil services delivered by councils. Reliable estimates suggest that public spending outside the NHS will still be 14% lower by 2024 than it was in 2010. The encroaching realities of Brexit could fatally undermine the Tories\u2019 appeal in large parts of the Midlands and the north, as investment slows and industries are upturned. Meanwhile, younger people\u2019s antipathy to the party and the leftward drift of England\u2019s cities and suburbs still highlight big questions about the Tories\u2019 long-term future.\n\nWe spent 10 years talking to people. Here's what it taught us about Britain Read more\n\nBut something is definitely happening. Johnson has already set great store by a 50p an hour rise in the minimum wage that will increase some people\u2019s earnings by nearly \u00a31,000 a year. The government is reportedly planning to spend around \u00a3100bn over the next five years on infrastructure projects. There is talk of rewriting Treasury spending rules to decisively tilt public investment away from London and the south-east, and the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d is suddenly back in vogue. And, jangling the nerves of Tory free marketeers, Johnson now talks about Brexit giving Britain the chance to bin EU rules about state aid, thereby allowing government to help troubled companies.\n\nA month on from the election, these things are less about ideological fashion than the inescapable realities of a redrawn political map. On election night, the prime minister marvelled at how the Tories could suddenly claim to speak \u201cfor everyone from Woking to Workington \u2026 [and] from Wimbledon to Wolverhampton\u201d. To hold this delicate coalition together will require not just the kind of shifts more thoughtful Tories are now talking about, but further changes in thinking that will jar against some of the party\u2019s deepest beliefs. Beyond Brexit, whether Johnson and his allies can achieve such feats will be one of the most compelling questions of the next five years.\n\n\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/the-government-response-to-the-bushfire-crisis-has-been-evasive-tepid-tone-deaf-and-above-all-too-late", "published": "2020-01-06T01:15:05", "title": "The government response to the bushfire crisis has been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and above all, too late | Kevin Rudd", "text": "\u200bIt\u2019s hard to know what to write in the midst of a national apocalypse.\u200b\u200b\n\nI\u2019m like most Australians, feeling every shade of human emotion each day as we see this living tragedy unfold before us.

Much of it justified. Some of it not. Our national government will have much to account for once the current crisis has passed.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is the government\u2019s response just doesn\u2019t pass the pub test.\n\nIt\u2019s been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and, above all, too late.\n\nIt\u2019s been conducted as an exercise in \u201cissue management\u201d, rather than a substantive response to one of the worst natural disasters in our history, with every shoulder to the wheel. And the Australian public can spot a fraud at a thousand paces.\n\nSo in the midst of all this, what can be said that\u2019s in any way productive for the future?\n\n\u200b\u200bFirst, the feds should be taking their marching orders from the state fire chiefs each day.\n\nIt\u2019s just not good enough when the New South Wales Rural Fire Service chief says he first heard of the call-out of the army reserve through the media.\n\nCanberra\u2019s job is to help provide whatever financial and physical resources firefighters and other emergency services need there and then. And on the question of \u201cwho\u2019s going to pay\u201d? I remember it well during the Victorian fires.\n\nThe answer should simply be: \u201cWhatever it takes. Just get it done.\u201d\u200b\u200b\n\nSecond, the National Bushfire Recovery Agency announced on Sunday should be underpinned by national legislation, jointly with the states, and empowered to slice through red tape.\n\nThere should be a national bushfire appeal \u2013 the Black Saturday appeal raised more than $400m \u2013 and its disbursement should be coordinated by new agency to avoid waste and duplication.\n\nThe taxable 13-week disaster recovery allowance should immediately be extended to 26 weeks and be exempted from tax, as it was in Victoria. The disaster relief payment of $1,000 has also lagged inflation, meaning its real value has fallen substantially since 2009.\n\nThird, provide proper permanent funding for the nation\u2019s bushfire services. The public will not tolerate any longer a discretionary \u201ctop-up\u201d by the feds, or the usual buck passing between the various levels of government. Each brigade needs to be confident of their long-term funding. The formula should be hammered out and rigorously implemented. \u200b\u200b\n\nAustralians aren\u2019t asking for miracles from Scott Morrison.

There will be accusations of waste if it remains idle for a while. Just like we were accused of waste when we co-funded Adelaide\u2019s desalination plant \u2013 until everybody realised we needed it.\n\nFifth, what more warning does Australia need on the absolute imperative of accelerated action on climate change? Not enough it seems for Scott Morrison, who says there will be no change in policy whatsoever. Nor for the high priest of climate change denial himself, Tony Abbott.\n\nIndeed, in the midst of the fires, there was Abbott on Israeli radio telling a global audience the real problem for Australia was that we had been taken over by a \u201cclimate change cult\u201d!\n\nAbbott! He who famously proclaimed climate change was \u201cabsolute crap\u201d. The political opportunist who stopped my government imposing a carbon price by toppling Malcolm Turnbull and revoking the deal we\u2019d struck to pass it.\n\nThe partisan thug who played cheap politics, ridiculing Australian efforts with our partners to broker a global deal at Copenhagen to keep temperatures within 2C. \u200bThe political cynic who ran the biggest fear campaign in recent memory against our carbon price in order to become prime minister in 2013. Yup.\n\nThe very same Abbott who destroyed Turnbull all over again in 2017 over climate policy \u2013 this time the national energy guarantee.\n\nSo why does Abbott do it? The truth is he doesn\u2019t give a damn about policy. Abbott has always been 100% politics. He\u2019s always seen climate as the perfect political wedge against Labor among working families, deploying fear campaigns based on wildly exaggerated projections about jobs and the cost of living. He\u2019s done the same internally, using it to divide and conquer his moderate opponents in the Liberal party.\n\nPretty tawdry when now we see half the country going up in smoke!\u200b\u200b\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub. The Abbott denialist cult has taken over the entire Coalition. It continues under Morrison and, when they oust him soon, it will continue under Peter Dutton. It\u2019s become the battle cry of the far right which now runs the entire conservative show in Canberra. \u200b\u200b\n\nAnd yes, before the Murdoch media leap to Abbott\u2019s defence, I know he is a firefighter. Good on him. The problem is most of the fire chiefs just don\u2019t agree with him on the impact of climate change. Nor does the CSIRO. Nor does any credible climate scientist in the world.\n\nIn Australia, as in America, the conservatives\u2019 strategic partner in climate change denial has been the Murdoch media. Rupert Murdoch, feeling the heat of public opinion, claimed recently there were no climate deniers at News Corp! The Murdochs, senior and junior, must believe the Australian people are total fools. Murdoch\u2019s papers remain a command centre for the entire mission of climate policy obstruction.\n\nJust look at their climate coverage over the last four federal elections.\n\nIn the midst of today\u2019s tragedy, we still see the old denialist trope trotted out that Australia, with only 1.3% of global emissions, can have no influence, and shouldn\u2019t bother trying. \u200b\u200bWhat pathetic nonsense.\n\nIf other middle-sized economies did the same \u2013 there are about 20 with a similar share of emissions \u2013 that\u2019s a quarter of the global total. We cannot work globally to get the biggest emitters \u2013 the US, China and India \u2013 to act unless we are also acting to clean up our own backyards. \u200b\u200b\n\nOur national interest dictates that Australia becomes once again a global climate change leader, not a follower. Unless we lead, and convince others to follow, Australia has a bleak future indeed. \u200b\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThe Australian people are angry. The Liberals and Nationals are now reaping what they have sown for more than a decade \u2013 through climate inaction at home, sabotaging climate negotiations abroad and a continuing pathology of poisonous fear mongering.\n\nThe melancholy truth is the only policies restraining Australian emissions today were taken under our government a decade ago.\n\nPrincipal among these is our legislated mandatory renewable energy target for 20% of electricity supply to be renewables by 2020. The conservatives said it would destroy the economy. It didn\u2019t. As a result, renewables are now 21%, up from 4% when we started.\u200b\u200b\n\nBut this is just the foundation stone of what must now become a bigger, bolder plan of national and international action.\n\nI stand by what I said a decade ago: climate change represents the greatest economic, environmental and moral challenge of our time. Moral because it\u2019s about what\u2019s right and wrong for the nation. Moral because it\u2019s about intergenerational justice.\n\nThe Liberals won\u2019t change on climate. Denial is now their DNA. They may start pretending to care. Scotty from marketing is good at that. But we all know it will be paper thin. That\u2019s why this lot have to go. Before it\u2019s too late for us all."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/jan/05/ben-jennings-on-boris-johnsons-input-on-the-us-iran-crisis-cartoon", "published": "2020-01-05T20:33:01", "title": "Ben Jennings on Boris Johnson's input on the US-Iran crisis \u2013 cartoon", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Britain\u2019s key ally is accused of war crimes on foreign soil in a fight with Iran and its regional proxies. European opinion has quickly solidified around the idea that both sides show restraint. The British response is to defy this advice and endorse a belligerent US administration\u2019s approach. Deja vu? It certainly should sound familiar.\n\nThe year was 2006 and the British prime minister was Tony Blair. His stubborn refusal to call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon dealt, by his own account, a \u201cfatal blow\u201d to his premiership.\n\nBoris Johnson could console himself that history does not quite repeat itself. He ought not to. Today\u2019s crisis in the Middle East is much more dangerous and volatile than the one faced by his predecessor. Unlike Mr Blair, the current Downing Street incumbent is unproven in war. Mr Johnson is also dealing with a far more unstable, narcissistic and bullying president in the shape of Donald Trump than Mr Blair did. The fact Mr Trump did not think it necessary to inform Britain of his rash decision to assassinate Qassem Suleimani \u2013 Iran\u2019s second most important leader after Ayatollah Khamenei \u2013 ought to tell Mr Johnson how little the White House thinks of him. Because the prime minister refused to return home early, his foreign secretary ate his own words in public. Dominic Raab was given a dressing down by his US counterpart after first siding with Europe over the almost certainly illegal killing of the thuggish Suleimani. It was disappointing to see Mr Raab replace his temperate response with self-serving US propaganda.\n\nThere appears barely any credible evidence of an imminent threat to the US from Suleimani or his Iranian-backed militias. Mr Trump has succeeded in replacing the media focus on his impeachment with the fallout from his lethal strike. This will not be inconsiderable: the Iraqi parliamentary vote for a motion calling for the ejection of US troops from the country is a taste of things to come. Mr Trump lacks the imagination to see the issues involved in the Middle East. The killing of the Iranian general is just another example of the failure of his \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d on Iran. His idea that crippling economic sanctions would force Tehran to capitulate only saw its leadership make bold military moves against both Arab rivals and western interests while restarting key parts of its nuclear programme.\n\nMr Trump projects the image of a strongman. Yet his actions have weakened the US strategic position in the Middle East. The national interest is not a guide to Mr Trump\u2019s action. What matters is personal political advantage in a US election year. To stoke his evangelical base he presents his rivalry with Iran as a clash of civilisations. It is appalling that he thinks a legitimate military response is to commit war crimes by levelling Iran\u2019s historic monuments. Mr Trump fears a public who already hold his policies responsible for tensions with Tehran. Whatever the Iranian retaliation it will be a messy outcome with no easy way for Mr Trump to pin the blame for war on anyone but himself.\n\nMr Johnson faces the first test of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit foreign policy posture. Unlike George W Bush, Mr Trump won\u2019t offer the British prime minister a way to sit out any upcoming war. He does not give help for free. He expects a quid pro quo. Jumping into the trenches with the US over a war Britain does not want may be the price Mr Johnson has to pay for a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal.

About once a month I would travel early in the morning from my house just outside of Jerusalem to his house in Ramat Aviv. He would make me \u201cthe best coffee in town\u201d according to him, and we would sit and chat.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it was the best coffee in town, but it definitely was the best company. We spoke about the state of the country, which seemed like it had no solution. We spoke about the dream and how that dream was shattering. About the books we had read. About other authors. About books we wrote, about frustrations and writer\u2019s block. And we spoke about our families. About our grandchildren and the world we were leaving them.\n\nIn each of his books, Amos expressed an ethical, political and clearly human stance\n\nI didn\u2019t gain his trust easily. In our first meetings he would sit in an armchair across from me, but his body and face were turned away. In those meetings he would listen very little and speak a lot. He basically lectured. But with each subsequent meeting he turned himself in his chair a few centimetres in my direction. With each meeting he lectured less and instead spoke \u2013 and listened \u2013 more and more. And when he finally sat with his face fully towards me, I knew he had begun to trust me.\n\nHe had a greatness about him, a nobility. Even towards those who attacked him. It was a nobility that was a bit anachronistic, as if from the 19th century. It wasn\u2019t easy for him, being Amos Oz. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to be the person who so many people project so much on to: their deepest desires, their hopes and disappointments, everything that is tangled and unresolved within them.\n\nI think of Amos the writer, and about Amos the spokesperson, and about what was in his writing that so succeeded in raising his readers; to stir them up, to shake them and to wake them.\n\nI think about his fictionalised characters, but also about the real people he met and documented. For example, in his wandering around Israel in autumn 1982, the journey that gave birth to one of his best books, In the Land of Israel. When we read this narrative, the same thing happens to us that happened to countless readers of A Tale of Love and Darkness: we feel that we are touching some elusive secret that is found in the foundation of the Israeli existence.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to define this secret in words: a type of vibration that is unending, spiritual, conscious. A vibration of an age-old memory and of unbearably hard traumas that still have not been digested or truly understood. A feeling of deep, existential insecurity that exists together with a sort of excessive self-satisfaction and hasty self-confidence. More than anything, I think, it is the vibration of a terrible pain, thousands of years old, that has no comfort. The hurt of a persecuted and hated nation that was almost annihilated. How turbulent it is to read all of this in a book. And how hard it is to live it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018His wandering around Israel in autumn 1982 gave birth to one of his best books.\u2019 Amos Oz in Arad, 1989. Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian\n\nIn each of his books, Amos expressed an ethical, political and clearly human stance, and we, the readers, travelled with him throughout the process. We experienced a wide net of emotions and thoughts, impulses and desires catching even our own soul\u2019s abominations, those that we know are distortions and deficiencies that have \u201crun in the family\u201d for generations.\n\nThanks to Amos and his unrivalled skill, we have faced them, have been burned by them, have perhaps even been tempted by them. We have also felt the misgivings of that which documents them. Sometimes we would also distance ourselves from him: sometimes he himself seemed like a character from one of his books, the same virtuous, reasonable rationalist who frustrated, and sometimes infuriated, us. Because of his powerlessness and his inability to better our complicated and nightmarish existence.\n\nHe said to me once: \u201cI hated my father in my youth, because I thought it was he who caused my mother to kill herself. And then I hated my mother, because how could she do something like that to me? How could she leave the house without saying where she was going? She was the one who demanded from each of us, whenever we left the house, to leave a note underneath the vase saying exactly where we were going \u2026\n\n\u201cAnd mostly I hated myself,\u201d said Amos, \u201cbecause if my mother killed herself, I must not have been lovable enough for her. How could it be? Even the mothers of Nazis loved their sons, and my mother didn\u2019t?\n\n\u2018The world is diminished by the death of Amos Oz, it has narrowed down\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cAnd only when I had my own children,\u201d said Amos, \u201cdid I begin to have compassion for my parents, and to love them. Only then was I able to understand them. And when I wrote A Tale of Love and Darkness I actually was a bit a \u2018parent of my parents\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor our last meeting, about a month before his passing, he asked me to bring my wife, Michal. And that meeting was distinct from the ones before it. Amos was at his peak \u2013 entertaining, witty, ironic, brilliant. He mostly did not speak about his illness, which at that point was already critical. He just said: \u201cThe architect of the body was a genius, but the contractor skimped on the materials.\u201d Michal and I laughed, but Amos apparently saw my expression and said: \u201cDon\u2019t pity me. I have had a very good life. Much better than I ever could have imagined. I have loving children, I have Nili, my beloved wife. My books are read around the world. I received so much more than one can ask from life.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Translated by Danielle Harris.\n\n\u2022 David Grossman is an Israeli author.

Shockingly, in our family courts, it seems it\u2019s only when you put up a fight and have the injuries to show for it. Never mind that you might clearly not consent to sex but in the end submit, terrified of what might happen if you were to actively resist.\n\nIn one recently reported case in the family courts a woman had complained to the court that she was a victim of domestic violence and had been raped.\n\nJudge Robin Tolson ruled that because the woman had taken \u201cno physical steps\u201d to stop the man from raping her, \u201cthis did not constitute rape\u201d, and consequently ruled against her.\n\nFamily courts failing victims of abuse and rape, say experts calling for inquiry Read more\n\nLegally speaking, this means that when it comes to that same judge deciding whether or not, say, it is safe for a father to have contact with his child, claims of sexual violence will not be taken into account. Because, in the eyes of the court, that rape simply didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe fact that the family law system in this country is hidden behind a veil of secrecy means that these offensively vintage attitudes to rape and domestic violence can persist in courts that tens of thousands of separating couples must pass through every year. And it raises the question: what other outrageously sexist decisions are being made by out-of-touch judges behind closed doors?\n\nThe woman in the above case was so horrified at the judge\u2019s finding that she challenged it via appeal. Unlike in a normal family court hearing, appeals are heard in public, and findings can be openly reported.\n\nIt is only because of this tiny chink in the family justice system\u2019s protective shield that we are able to glimpse inside Judge Tolson\u2019s courtroom, and see such attitudes for what they are. The usual level of secrecy in the family courts stifles investigation and reporting of what goes on.\n\nI am typically contacted several times a week by women who say family judges have not taken their evidence of domestic abuse seriously. These women, often mothers fearful of the man they say abused and sometimes raped them, are without question retraumatised by a system presided over by some judges who have simply not accepted a modern understanding of what is and is not domestic abuse or sexual assault.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be physically forced, there don\u2019t need to be bruises, you don\u2019t need to scream, for it to be rape\n\nWomen point particularly to difficulties in proving coercive control, a dangerous pattern of abusive behaviour that can indicate a risk of homicide. Coercive control is now a criminal offence; but in family courts, I am repeatedly told, judges are reluctant to name it, even if they find that emotional and psychological abuse has occurred.\n\nNot only that. Women say that judges can even agree domestic abuse has occurred but not consider it serious enough to protect the victim and child from what we now know to be its damaging continuing effects: an abusive ex can easily continue their controlling behaviour throughout many years of court-ordered contact with a child.\n\nIf it were \u201cjust\u201d scores of women telling me that this is happening, then these allegations would be exactly that: allegations. However, I recently sat through days of evidence in a family court case involving claims of domestic abuse and a dispute around child contact arrangements. The judge in that case made it clear he is unlikely to publish a judgment, and it is therefore unlikely at this stage that he will agree to allow the media to publish any part of what went on in court.\n\nBut I can say that I emerged from that courtroom astonished, dismayed and alarmed for very similar reasons to those that prompted the woman described above to appeal against a different judge\u2019s findings about what constitutes rape.\n\nIn the year ending March 2019, more than 58,000 allegations of rape were made to police in England and Wales. It is an uncomfortable fact that many women are forced to have sex without their consent within relationships. It may be inconvenient for a family law system that operates on the principle that children are better off having contact with both their parents to acknowledge this truth. But surely any judge who grasps the mechanisms and psychological effects of coercive control should understand that you don\u2019t need to be physically forced, there don\u2019t need to be bruises, and you don\u2019t need to scream, in order for it to be rape.\n\nWhy I fought for the right to open up family courts to greater scrutiny | Louise Tickle Read more\n\nThis is 2020, not 1920. Society has moved on. So have the criminal courts, which are open to scrutiny and would be instantly challenged should any barrister or judge articulate such archaic attitudes. Unless you have the courage and the cash to go to appeal, however, the family courts are essentially unaccountable to the public they serve.\n\nThanks to one of the most senior judges in the land coming firmly down on the side of the woman in the Judge Tolson case, she won her appeal. But it may well feel like a hollow victory. She will now have to relive every aspect of her evidence of domestic abuse and sexual assault at a new fact-finding hearing. This will be in front of a different judge. But that court will, once again, sit in private. How can we \u2013 or she \u2013 know what attitudes to sexual violence lie in store for her there?\n\n\u2022 Louise Tickle is a journalist who specialises in social affairs and family law"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/05/cold-streets-haunted-australia-bushfires", "published": "2020-01-05T19:00:08", "title": "On cold streets far from home, I am haunted by Australia\u2019s bushfires | Open door", "text": "I wonder if other Australian expatriates in cold London felt it last week.

Even though he was glacially slow, Sibley scoring just three off his first 30 deliveries and taking 50 overs to reach his half-century, he provided the platform for others to play around him.

But work with the freelance batting coach Gary Palmer, who has also helped Cook and Ian Bell, led him to remodel his technique and the runs have since flowed.\n\nA more open stance, to prevent him from falling towards the off-side, and hitting straighter has helped unlock the potential that was evident in 2013 when Sibley, aged 18 and 21 days, become the second-youngest English player, behind only WG Grace, to hit a first-class double hundred.\n\nThat high point against Yorkshire was followed by a trough, as so often happens with young players.

An IT glitch meant that patients were not followed up to see how soon they would need potentially life-saving surgery.\n\nA doctor at the trust, however, says it initially repeatedly refused to take any action, raising further questions about its management.\n\nThe trust initially suggested the problem was the result of senior doctors not keeping up with emails, but later accepted its IT systems were at fault. The hospital was forced to recognise that patients were potentially put at risk and took action only after a whistleblower alerted the NHS regulator.\n\nThe Bury St Edmunds hospital is already at the centre of claims of bullying and intimidation after it demanded medical staff take fingerprint tests in an effort to identify a whistleblower who raised the alarm about potentially botched surgery with the family of a patient who died under its care.\n\nIt has offered a partial apology to staff and agreed to reflect on its tactics after the Guardian revealed its extraordinary response to an anonymous letter a member of staff sent to the patient\u2019s widow.\n\nResponding to the new claims, the hospital acknowledged problems had occurred with its vascular surgery services and confirmed that an investigation was under way, but insisted that no patients had been harmed.\n\nThe issue involves the handling of scans for patients with aneurysms which are conducted to detect signs of growth in case surgery is required to prevent a life-threatening rupture. Under the hospital\u2019s eCare system those scans were automatically deleted after 90 days. The hospital\u2019s email system failed to alert doctors that they needed to check the scans before they disappeared from the system.\n\nRegular monitoring of these patients is vital because consultants need to know whether an aneurysm has reached 5cm in diameter, at which point they require an operation before the swollen blood vessels bursts.\n\nBoyle, who is based at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, but also works at West Suffolk, was so concerned about patients not being followed up that he made entries on Datix, the NHS-wide system for flagging up patient safety incidents.\n\nBoyle, the associate editor of the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, did not respond to the Guardian after calls for comment. But a colleague and someone familiar with the issues both said Boyle made several Datix incidents reports about the problem.\n\nHis reports were dismissed, however, with a note saying that \u201cno further action\u201d was needed by the hospital\u2019s head of eCare system, Dr Dermot O\u2019Riordan, who previously served as the trust\u2019s medical director and its interim chief executive.\n\nBoyle was so alarmed by this failure to follow up his concerns that he reported the problem to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which inspects and rates hospitals, including on the safety of their care.\n\nO\u2019Riordan has not responded to a request to comment.\n\nThe unnamed doctor told the Guardian that the problem typified how the trust sought to bury any signs of failure. \u201cThe trust knew what happened and didn\u2019t act,\u201d he said. The trust\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Dunn, was awarded a CBE last year for services to health and patient safety.\n\nFollowing Boyle\u2019s intervention, the CQC asked the trust to explain its action both before and during its inspection visits in September and October. The trust is expected to lose its \u201coutstanding\u201d rating when the commission reports this month. The regulator has already said its maternity services need significant improvement.\n\n\u201cThe reporting system used by the NHS is an important protection for patients, but only if it works properly and is acted upon. Delays in monitoring patients with aneurysms is a serious matter, potentially a life and death matter,\u201d said Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, a patient safety charity.\n\n\u201cIt is very surprising that this was not acted upon and even more so if the doctor reporting concerns is senior. If patient safety is given the priority it deserves in a trust it should not need the CQC to intervene, but on behalf of the patients I am glad they did.\u201d\n\nA CQC spokeswoman said: \u201cWe were made aware of concerns regarding the handling of information submitted via the trusts\u2019 Datix incident reporting system. These concerns were followed up directly with the trust prior to and during CQC\u2019s latest inspection.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for West Suffolk NHS foundation trust said: \u201cRegrettably, we identified an issue with our vascular surgery services and an investigation is under way. All affected patients have been identified, are receiving the appropriate treatment and there is currently no evidence that patients have been harmed.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out that when it realised the problem might affect patients it recorded the potential problem on its risk register. It also introduced a new policy to ensure that doctors act on patients\u2019 results, including scans, within 28 days.\n\nAfter the Guardian revealed the unprecedented lengths to which the hospital had gone to identify whistleblowers last month, it appeared to acknowledge that it may have gone too far.\n\nIn a statement on its website after the story was published, it said: \u201cWe asked staff who were involved in the investigation to provide handwriting and fingerprint examples in order to immediately rule themselves out of the investigation. Staff were asked to provide these, and were not threatened with disciplinary action if they chose not to do so.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that for some colleagues involved that it did not necessarily feel that way and that this was a very difficult and stressful situation for them, for which we are sorry.\u201d\n\nIt stopped short of acknowledging that the tactics were wrong, but added: \u201cKnowing the impact it has had on staff involved, we will continue to reflect on as an organisation on our approach.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/05/police-interview-four-over-problems-at-care-home-in-westminster", "published": "2020-01-05T15:21:50", "title": "Police investigate care of elderly people in Westminster home", "text": "Police have interviewed four women under caution in a criminal investigation into the treatment of about 30 elderly people at a London care home, the management of which was outsourced to a private company by a flagship Conservative council in a bid to save money.\n\nCare regulators rated Garside House nursing home as inadequate last month following inspections prompted by a whistleblower. The Care Quality Commission discovered dehydration, serious medication errors, wrongful deprivation of liberty and staffing levels cut below the level stipulated in the contract with Westminster city council.\n\nThe council outsourced the running of the the home to Sanctuary Care in 2015 as part of an eight-year contract worth \u00a3126m to \u201cdeliver savings\u201d.

The council must take action now to finally end the contract with Sanctuary.\u201d\n\nHeather Acton, Westminster\u2019s cabinet member for public health, said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that anyone should be treated with anything but the utmost care and respect at a time of life when they need it most. This was obviously not happening and I\u2019m saddened by the fact that some residents have experienced this poor level of care.\n\n\u201cThe police are still investigating and we will support them in any way we can. We are carefully considering the next steps with the NHS, but we\u2019re clear that the safety and care of our residents remains our priority.\u201d\n\nSarah Clarke-Kuehn, the group director for care at Sanctuary Care, said: \u201cWe are very sorry that the standard of care at Garside House fell far short of that which we aim to provide.

The document codifies the trust\u2019s calls for much stricter policies on fish farms, offshore renewables and mitigating the impacts of climate change on the sea.\n\nStuart Brooks, the trust\u2019s head of conservation and policy, said there should be a restriction of all mechanised fishing within that coastal zone, except for places where there was sufficient evidence inshore fishing was safe.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s about the sustainability of our fisheries, and the people and wildlife that depend on them,\u201d he said. Marine tourism now employed more people than fishing, he added.\n\nThe coalition, which includes NTS, is launching a campaign later this month urging the Scottish government to impose a three-nautical-mile ban, which was in force in Scottish waters for nearly a century until it was lifted in 1984.\n\nThe policy would have a significant impact on the boats that primarily trawl for langoustine or dredge for scallops, which replaced the once-bountiful stocks of finfish such as cod and herring that collapsed in inshore waters from overfishing.\n\nThe campaigners acknowledge narrow sea lochs and many sea channels between the islands would be closed to all trawling, except where trawlers can prove their activities were safe. It would promote lower-impact creel fishing for langoustine, crab and lobster, and hand-dived scallop firms.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lobster caught between Iona and the Ross of Mull, where creel fishing predominates. Photograph: Richard Baker/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nOpen Seas, a conservation charity in the Our Seas coalition, cites an expert study for the Scottish government that said a three-mile closure could produce up to 2,707 extra jobs after 20 years, and at least \u00a31bn of additional income, because it would boost fish stocks and other industries.\n\nScottish ministers have so far resisted pressure to adopt this proposal and have instead offered to ban bottom-trawling or dredging in 11 types of sensitive or rare habitat known as priority marine features.\n\nThese include beds of flame shell, seagrass and maerl, cold-water coral reefs, Northern sea fan and sponge communities, and native oyster colonies. Scores of sites around Scotland containing these habitats and species would be closed off. Scotland already has an extensive network of marine protected areas, covering 25% of the Celtic seas along the west coast and islands, and 12% of the North Sea.\n\nCampaigners argue this strategy of piecemeal designation has failed. They point to incidents where priority features have already been destroyed by illegally dredging or where trawlers have been fishing inside exclusion zones, without being caught or penalised.\n\nAlistair Sinclair, of the Scottish Creel Fishermen\u2019s Federation, a partner in the Our Seas coalition, said: \u201cWe need to look forward and think of the generations coming after us.

Lawyers acting on behalf of one of the applicants, Chishamiso Mkundi, 51, applied for a judicial review after his asylum claim was rejected.\n\nGranting permission for the review last month, judges said: \u201cIt is at least arguable that the respondent [the home secretary, Priti Patel] failed to consider whether her own actions, in inviting an official from the Zimbabwean embassy to an interview with the Home Office in December 2018, might have brought the applicant to the direct attention to the Zimbabwean authorities.\u201d\n\nMany asylum seekers from Zimbabwe sought refuge in the UK because of their anti-government protests or support for the country\u2019s opposition. Their claims were often rejected on the basis that they were not of sufficiently high profile to come to the attention of the Zimbabwe authorities and thus risk being mistreated on their return.\n\nEarlier this year, the high court granted permission for judicial review in a case of another asylum seeker, AG, who challenged the Home Office practice of interviewing asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected, and sharing their information with Zimbabwean government officials. A date for a hearing has been set in February.\n\nAG\u2019s lawyer, Rowan Pennington-Benton, said: \u201cOur client is one of many asylum seekers told by the Home Office that it was safe for them to return, as they were not high profile and would slip under the radar upon arrival in Harare.\n\n\u201cThe Home Office practice of highlighting the presence of these persons, and even allowing them to be interviewed by Zimbabwean officials, seriously and somewhat obviously undermines this.\n\n\u201cThe practice is dangerous and from a Home Office policy perspective curiously self-defeating, as it provides failed asylum seekers with good grounds to resist removal.\u201d\n\nMugabe\u2019s government refused to cooperate with British attempts to return people to Zimbabwe, unlike the administration of his successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nDespite hopes that Mnangagwa\u2019s government would bring political reform, human rights activists have condemned arbitrary arrests, abductions and beatings committed by the police and military.\n\nZimbabweans living in the UK told the Guardian earlier this year that the interviews with officials had left them nervous and unable to sleep. \u201cI\u2019m still so scared.

At an improvised session in the headquarters of a local newspaper, pro-Guaid\u00f3 lawmakers re-elected him as national assembly president, meaning that it \u2013 like Venezuela \u2013 now had two rival leaders.\n\n\u201cToday, once again, we have defeated the dictatorship,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told supporters. \u201cWe have resoundingly defeated the dictatorship\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\nThe United States criticised the Maduro regime\u2019s move, saying it would not recognize what it called a desperate and phoney \u201cfarce\u201d that went \u201ccompletely against the will of the people\u201d, adding: \u201cDemocracy cannot be intimidated.\u201d\n\nA European Union spokesperson said the day\u2019s events were unacceptable and represented \u201ca new step in the deterioration of the Venezuelan crisis\u201d. \u201cAs a consequence, the EU continues to recognise Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate president of the national assembly,\u201d the EU added.\n\nThe foreign minister of Brazil\u2019s far-right government, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, accused Maduro of attempting to forcefully prevent Guaid\u00f3\u2019s re-election, tweeting: \u201cBrazil will not recognize any outcome of this violence and this affront to democracy.\u201d\n\nBut there was also criticism from Argentina\u2019s new left-wing government. \u201cForcibly preventing the functioning of the national assembly means condemning oneself to international isolation,\u201d tweeted its new foreign minister, Felipe Sol\u00e1.\n\nThe move appeared designed to further weaken Guaid\u00f3, who recently vowed 2020 would be Venezuela\u2019s \u201cyear of freedom\u201d despite the growing impression that his campaign against Maduro is faltering.\n\nMore than 50 governments including the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil recognized Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s president, based on his leadership of the assembly and suspicions Maduro had stolen the 2018 presidential election.\n\nDespite that backing, mass street protests, and at least two attempts to spark military uprisings against Maduro, Guaid\u00f3 has failed to topple Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s authoritarian heir, who still enjoys support from China and Russia.\n\nIn a recent interview with El Pa\u00eds, Guaid\u00f3 denied his movement had failed and compared himself to a jogger entering \u201cthe final lap\u201d of the quest for political change.\n\nIn a televised speech on Sunday afternoon, Maduro recognized Parra\u2019s leadership and attacked Guaid\u00f3 as a \u201cpuppet of North American imperialism\u201d.\n\nBut Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, said Maduro\u2019s \u201cbrutal and ham-fisted\u201d move could backfire by \u201cre-legitimizing\u201d Guaid\u00f3 as a \u201cdemocratic martyr\u201d.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s international supporters would remain loyal, even if he did not retain his position at the head of the national assembly. \u201cThey won\u2019t abandon him,\u201d Sabatini predicted."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/rosanna-arquette-set-to-attend-harvey-weinstein-trial", "published": "2020-01-05T17:30:59", "title": "Rosanna Arquette set to attend Harvey Weinstein trial", "text": "The actor Rosanna Arquette, one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s most prominent accusers, says she plans to attend the trial of the disgraced film producer when it starts in New York on Monday.\n\nArquette will not be giving evidence in the case, but she said she will be there to lend support to the handful of women who have been allowed to give testimony in court of Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct and abuse.\n\n\u201cI feel very protective,\u201d Arquette said of those due to give evidence.

Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nThe alleged incident occurred too long ago to be tried separately, but will be used by prosecutors to support accusations of a pattern of behaviour by Weinstein.\n\nThe 67-year-old faces two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one of rape in the first degree and one of rape in the third degree. He denies the charges.\n\nArquette said: \u201cThis is a man that is a real predator. He\u2019s destroyed many women\u2019s lives ... We need to keep the focus on this crime, and this case with Harvey Weinstein is huge because so many people are looking at it.\u201d\n\nShe was one of the first women to come forward in 2017 at the start of the #MeToo movement after New York Times and New Yorker investigations into widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by Weinstein. She accused Weinstein of derailing her career after she resisted his advances, a claim he denies.\n\nArquette is hoping the testimony of Sciorra and others will lead to an eventual conviction against Weinstein, which if successful could result in him being jailed for life.\n\nShe said Sciorra\u2019s life was \u201cshattered by this experience for many years\u201d.\n\nArquette, who is best known for appearing alongside Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan, added: \u201cThe justice system works in a way ... people can get out of criminal behaviour, and we\u2019re praying that that doesn\u2019t happen and that justice is served.\u201d\n\nRose McGowan, another of Weinstein\u2019s most well known accusers, has decided not to attend the trial fearing it will be too traumatic.\n\nShe said: \u201cI also have to focus on what\u2019s healthy mentally for me and seeing him is extremely difficult.\u201d McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her over 20 years ago and destroying her career; charges he also denies.\n\nWeinstein has denied all wrongdoing and all accusations.\n\nMcGowan said: \u201cI had body flashbacks for years when I would see and receive photos of him or if I saw him in person, I would lean over and throw up in a trash can and my body remembered, you know, things that my brain wanted to silence.\u201d\n\nMcGowan said seeing Weinstein face criminal charges \u201cwill speak volumes to people in the world that have been hurt.

Film is the art of rascals!'", "text": "Arnaud Desplechin looks surprisingly calm as he excuses himself to listen to a voicemail from the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s technical team. France is one week into a general strike over pension reform and the country\u2019s premier theatre company has followed suit, resulting in cancelled performances and rehearsals. \u201cWe take it day by day,\u201d says Desplechin, whose new production of Angels in America is due to open in mid-January. \u201cIt will start to get difficult if it continues.\u201d We spoke in December and the strike is still going strong, but there is no plan to delay.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Tony Kushner\u2019s sprawling 1990s play about the Aids crisis is only Desplechin\u2019s second theatre project, his first being a 2015 version of August Strindberg\u2019s Father. The 59-year-old auteur is renowned for such character-driven screen dramas as Kings and Queen and My Golden Days, which often draw on his own life and background. Yet this month he will be in two Paris theatres at once, since an adaptation of his film A Christmas Tale is appearing at the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe.\n\nIt\u2019s an unlikely development for a film director who never pined for the stage. \u201cI always told myself I would never do theatre,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was for bourgeois, adult people, while I was making cinema, the art of rascals.\u201d Father, he says sheepishly, came out of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d. Eric Ruf, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s director, had a small part in My Golden Days, and one morning asked Desplechin if he would direct a production for the company, 10 minutes before filming was due to start. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, of course.\u2019 But if he\u2019d asked me to run around the block in my underwear, I would have done it \u2013 anything so the actor is good.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Festive froideur \u2026 Mathieu Amalric and Catherine Deneuve in A Christmas Tale. Photograph: Allstar/IFC FILMS\n\nRuf took him at his word and the result was Father. Angels in America is a more ambitious undertaking. Desplechin says the company was \u201cterrified\u201d when he proposed more than 40 set changes: the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise is a repertoire theatre, so productions must rotate from one day to the next, and come with a strict three-hour time limit. To make it work, Ruf, an experienced set designer himself, provided support and extra rehearsal time on the stage of the Salle Richelieu, the company\u2019s historical home, not far from the Louvre.\n\nDesplechin, who is focusing on the romantic relationships between the mostly gay characters, admits to some trepidation, not being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cI felt it was missing from my work,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that some heterosexual love stories have the privilege of being universal, while there is something singular about a gay story. So how do you make sure everyone in the audience is moved? Am I capable of it?\u201d Like fellow film-maker Christophe Honor\u00e9 \u2013 who crafted an impressive play, Les Idoles, about the toll the Aids crisis took on the French intellectual scene \u2013 Desplechin lost some of his artistic heroes to the illness, and vividly remembers the pervading sense of \u201cterror\u201d.\n\nWhen discussing his theatre work, the soft-spoken French director seems in awe of his Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise cast. \u201cThere is a technical knowledge that I don\u2019t have. I feel very lucky to be a student. If my actors are happy, if they think I haven\u2019t said anything stupid, then it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nA different side of Desplechin comes out when the conversation turns to cinema, his childhood love. \u201cOn film sets, I like to be the king,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a despot. When I need to go to the bathroom, everyone shouts, \u2018The king is going to the bathroom\u2019 \u2013 because it takes three minutes and everything is organised around me. I love it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You want a production to be the best it can be, the rest doesn\u2019t concern me\u2019 \u2026 Oh Mercy! starring L\u00e9a Seydoux (right).

Roubaix, the nondescript industrial city in northern France where he was born, has provided the background for many of his films, including A Christmas Tale and his latest, Oh Mercy! He even filmed his own family in a 2007 documentary, L\u2019Aim\u00e9e. \u201cYou work on a production, you want it to be the best it can be. The rest doesn\u2019t concern me.\u201d\n\nNot even, I ask, when he was sued, unsuccessfully, by his former partner Marianne Denicourt, who claimed in her 2005 book Evil Genius that Desplechin had lifted painful episodes from her personal life without permission to write Kings and Queen? Desplechin appears unconcerned: \u201cOf my films, it\u2019s the one that performed best at the box office, what can I tell you?\u201d\n\nThe rest of his family, he adds, has learned to live with it. \u201cYou know what they say: there is no worse curse than to have a child who is a writer. If you\u2019re Kafka\u2019s father, you\u2019re not going to be very pleased.\u201d Does Desplechin hope his own son won\u2019t turn to writing? He laughs. \u201cLook how much of a masochist I am. Of course I hope he\u2019ll be Kafka! As long as I\u2019m good material for him.\u201d\n\nDesplechin seems genuinely happy to take a back seat for his Angels in America \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m here to serve Kushner, that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 and to see A Christmas Tale reinvented for the stage. Don\u2019t expect him to write a play any time soon, however. \u201cI feel like you need a lifetime of theatre experience to do that.

In 2016, he created and directed his first TV series, The Young Pope, which starred Jude Law. For the follow-up, The New Pope, John Malkovich joins the cast.\n\nWas it always your plan to make a sequel to The Young Pope?\n\nNo, initially I intended to end the story with The Young Pope. It was while editing the first season that I had the idea that opened up the game again.\n\nWe left the first series with Pope Pius XIII (Jude Law) in a coma. Now the Catholic church is seeking a replacement, right?\n\nExactly. They appoint John Paul III (John Malkovich), who is quite the opposite of his predecessor. Pius was ambitious and had always wanted to become pope. John Paul III is a reluctant pope who does it despite himself. He\u2019s moderate with a natural inclination towards compromise, whereas Pius was much more hardline and conservative.\n\nSo the new pope is more like a politician?\n\nYes, like a smart politician. Which are increasingly rare creatures. It\u2019s interesting. The church still believes in training its people and preparing them for power. Politics used to be like that too, but nowadays we have more and more improvised politicians with no experience.\n\nWhy did you decide to make John Paul III a Brit? There\u2019s only ever been one British pope and that was nearly 900 years ago.\n\nI made him English because he\u2019s a key figure in converting as many Anglicans as possible to the Catholic church. That\u2019s why he\u2019s selected to be pope.\n\nBut then Pius wakes up, which is considered a miracle, and a power struggle ensues. What were your inspirations for that rivalry?\n\nI don\u2019t tend to get inspiration from outside sources, but from inside myself. In all the stories I tell, the struggles of my characters are the struggles I have within me.\n\nSharon Stone and Marilyn Manson guest star in this series.

Photograph: Gianni Fiorito\n\nMichelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0 gets damaged by a terrorist bomb in the new series. Did that feel like sacrilege?\n\nNot really. I saw it as quite a likely scenario. We\u2019re living under the clear and present threat of terrorism. In Italy, there has been talk of possible targets for terror attacks and the Vatican is one of them, so why not fantasise about what could happen?\n\nHas TV caught up with film now, in terms of its scale and ambition?\n\nI don\u2019t think television and cinema are in competition. But in recent years, TV at its best has become like an extension of cinema. In the 60s and 70s, the so-called cin\u00e9ma d\u2019auteur movement enabled directors to make long, impressionistic films. Now that\u2019s impossible in film-making, but TV allows you the opportunity to tell those long-form stories.\n\nYour work is visually very beautiful. Did you ever want to be an artist?\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable even to draw a small house [laughs]. I wish I could paint, but I belong to the old-school theory that an artist must also possess technique. I don\u2019t have that. The only technical ability I have is in film-making.\n\nYou\u2019ve made films about a pair of Italian prime ministers: Il Divo, about Giulio Andreotti, and Loro, about Silvio Berlusconi. Any more planned?\n\nTwo is enough! I don\u2019t feel the need to make any more. They\u2019re quite delicate. I have a big imagination and I like to use it, but when you\u2019re dealing with well-known real people, you have to be very careful and respectful. That\u2019s a game I\u2019m no longer interested in playing.\n\nYou can\u2019t write without listening to music. What sort of music is best?\n\nYes, I always have music in the background as I write, but the volume is usually very low. Sometimes I forget there\u2019s music in the room. I have eclectic taste. I just got that end-of-year report from Spotify about what I\u2019ve listened to and it\u2019s all kinds of genres.\n\nYou once said that Diego Maradona saved your life. How?\n\nIt was literally fate. When I was 16, I was supposed to go on holiday with my parents but decided to stay home because I really wanted to go and watch my football team Napoli play. My parents had an accident on holiday and died. So yes, my passion for soccer \u2013 and for Maradona in particular \u2013 saved my life.\n\nDo you still have that passion?\n\nVery much so, but not just for Napoli, for all soccer. I often find myself stopping to watch matches in parks or schoolyards. I used to play, but I turn 50 this year and it\u2019s important in life to know when to stop doing things! I wish I could have been a football coach, but I never studied to be one and it\u2019s too late now.\n\nThe New Pope review \u2013 enter a seductively camp John Malkovich Read more\n\nHow do you feel about turning 50?\n\nIt was more fun when I turned 20!

Theatre and TV\n\nThalissa Teixeira\n\nThalissa Teixeira was hoping not to die in 2020. But she\u2019s playing Bianca in Thomas Middleton\u2019s Women Beware Women at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, so sadly she will cop it at the end (no great spoiler \u2013 it is a Jacobean tragedy after all). She laughs. \u201cAt the audition I said: \u2018Do we have to see another woman die?\u2019 So many plays I\u2019ve done, women die: in Yerma, Billie died; in Julie, Vanessa died; in Blood Wedding, Aoife died\u2026\u201d\n\nTeixira has a point, but this bloody litany also serves as a handy summary of the 27-year-old\u2019s impressive CV. Since graduating from the Royal Welsh College in 2014, she\u2019s played opposite Vanessa Kirby in Polly Stenham\u2019s Miss Julie at the National Theatre, and with Billie Piper and Aoife Duffin in the Lorca plays Yerma and Blood Wedding at the Young Vic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thalissa Teixeira photographed by Suki Dhanda for the Observer.\n\nTeixeira is a memorable performer, even in supporting roles \u2013 but this looks to be a break-out year. She stars opposite Maisie Williams in Sky\u2019s crime caper Two Weeks to Live, playing a \u201cstone-cold\u201d cop, and in Trigonometry \u2013 a BBC Two comedy written by Duncan Macmillan and Effie Woods about a flatshare that turns into a polyamorous relationship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with maths \u2013 thank God, because I would not be able to act that!\u201d says Teixeira. She was so desperate to get the part, she wrote a pleading letter to the director Athina Tsangari after her audition. \u201cIt\u2019s funny: so many people are wanting to use the term \u2018controversial\u2019 because it\u2019s about three people falling in love together, but it\u2019s never been a word we used,\u201d says Teixeira.\n\nLive performance is still her main love, however: Teixeira is part of storytelling group the Embers Collective. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most terrifying performances: you\u2019re retelling an ancient story that\u2019s been told millions of times before, in your own words, no one\u2019s directed you, you have nowhere to hide. It\u2019s so revealing \u2013 which is probably why I love it. I\u2019m a bit addicted to it.\u201d\n\nShe links this urge to perform to her heritage: born in Bradford to a black Brazilian father and white British mother, she was raised in El Salvador, returning to the UK when she was eight. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I became an actor, because in Brazil everyone is performing all the time.\u201d\n\nTeixeira considers herself lucky that she\u2019s rarely been cast because of her race \u2013 but adds that she \u201chates\u201d the term \u201ccolourblind casting\u201d. That change needs to be seen in the writing, she says. \u201cWhy are we putting on plays written by long-dead, white, fascist, racist men, and then putting some black people in it? Why don\u2019t we put more money into plays about people Ian McKellen would never be able to perform?\u201d\n\nHolly Williams\n\n2. Books\n\nBig names return\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hilary Mantel, who will publish the final book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy this year. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nIt promises to be a tremendous year for fiction, with an embarrassment of big-name novelists returning to the fray. There will be new novels from Anne Tyler, Isabel Allende, Lionel Shriver, Roddy Doyle, Sebastian Barry and JM Coetzee, but it will be hardest to miss Hilary Mantel, who will publish the third and final book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy in March \u2013 an event looked forward to with as much feverish longing as the follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale last year. The first two books in the series, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, both won the Man Booker prize (a unique achievement for successive novels), so it\u2019s a good bet that The Mirror and the Light will make for a triumphant finale. Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet (March) marks a departure for a much-loved and acclaimed author as she too takes on historical fiction. \u201cDazzling. Devastating,\u201d says Kamila Shamsie of the novel, which was inspired by the family tragedy of Shakespeare\u2019s son, who died aged 11. Also eagerly awaited is the debut novel by US nonfiction author Ta-Nehisi Coates. The Water Dancer merges historical and fantasy fiction in a slavery story that Oprah Winfrey says is one of the best books she has read in her life. Phew!\n\nUrsula Kenny\n\n3.

Photograph: Warner Bros\n\nCats arrived to widespread derision last month, but hopes remain high for several splashy, stage-derived musicals in 2020. While the world waits for a Hamilton movie, Lin-Manuel Miranda fans will be tided over with the film of his earlier Broadway smash In the Heights, a vibrant ensemble piece set within New York\u2019s Latin American community, with a score encompassing salsa and hip-hop. It\u2019ll make for an interesting contrast to Steven Spielberg\u2019s Ansel Elgort-starring remake of the beloved West Side Story, adapted by Pulitzer-winning playwright Tony Kushner. Here in Britain, meanwhile, surprise West End hit Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie is coming to the screen with a cast of bright young things and stalwarts including Richard E Grant; this feelgood story of a teenage drag queen could be the next Billy Elliot.\n\nGuy Lodge\n\n4. TV\n\nNormal People\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daisy Edgar Jones and Paul Mescal in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s novel Normal People. Photograph: BBC/Element\n\nThe plot of Sally Rooney\u2019s phenomenally successful second novel presents no obvious barriers to adaptation: this story of two young people negotiating the pitfalls of love and tertiary education in post-crash Ireland is ripe for onscreen drama. Whether the new 12-part TV version of Normal People for the BBC and Hulu (airing this spring) can match Rooney\u2019s razor-sharp psychological observations and weightless narrative flow is another question. But the talent behind it bodes well, with Lenny Abrahamson, the Irish director of Room, Frank and Garage, overseeing the series alongside Hettie Macdonald (Doctor Who, Fortitude). Cold Feet actor Daisy Edgar-Jones and newcomer Paul Mescal play Marianne and Connell.\n\nKillian Fox\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rory Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan photographed at the Manchester Royal Exchange by Gary Calton for the Observer.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that change in British theatre will only come about when you change who\u2019s in charge. And a new trend in 2019 has proved quietly progressive: job shares. The artistic directorship of Manchester Royal Exchange is now split between two rising directing talents: Bryony Shanahan and Roy Alexander Weise. They join other recent appointments \u2013 Charlotte Bennett and Katie Posner at Paines Plough; Debbie Hannan and Gareth Nicholls at the Traverse \u2013 in opening up possibilities for more collaborative arts leadership.\n\n\u201cWho we are and what we look like and the point at which we are in our careers is maybe a bit different,\u201d Shanahan says. She met Weise in 2013, when they both had a BBC theatre fellowship; in 2016, each won emerging director awards, resulting in shows at the Young Vic \u2013 Trade by Debbie Tucker Green for Shanahan and Katori Hall\u2019s The Mountaintop for Weise. Shanahan has since directed Queens of the Coal Age at the Royal Exchange, while Weise has directed Nine Night and Master Harold and the Boys at the National Theatre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think theatres should be run by just one person,\u201d says Weise. \u201cEspecially theatres of this size and ambition,\u201d adds Shanahan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge job.\u201d They\u2019ve yet to announce their first season, but Shanahan directs Wuthering Heights and Let the Right One In in 2020, as programmed by former artistic director Sarah Frankcom. They\u2019re keen to broaden the stories that get staged. \u201cThe world I live in doesn\u2019t look like what I see on stage sometimes,\u201d says Weise. \u201cWe have to try 150% to make that happen.\u201d\n\nThat they have an easygoing friendship is evident when we meet, but their differing styles complement each other too: Shanahan is softly spoken, a little more cautious, while Weise tends to jump into answers, all beaming grins and belly laughs. When he says she\u2019ll be looking after all the spreadsheets, he\u2019s joking \u2013 but she might just be the more practical one. On the day Weise moved house from his native London to Didsbury, just outside Manchester, she turned up at his doorstep with bags of groceries.\n\nThe job share came about because they are mates \u2013 a friendship that really developed when Weise stayed with Shanahan in Manchester, where she\u2019s lived and worked for four years (she grew up in Staffordshire). \u201cBryony was coming home every day with this great passion for the theatre and what it could be,\u201d Weise recalls.\n\nAnd Shanahan does believe the theatre\u2019s in-the-round space is rather special. \u201cIt\u2019s a democratic arena \u2013 it doesn\u2019t let you be dishonest, audiences can sniff it out. So there\u2019s a really healthy lack of pretension here.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot like Manchester,\u201d laughs Weise. \u201cPeople tell you how it is!\u201d\n\nHW\n\n6.

Kicking off proceedings \u2013 injuries permitting \u2013 Madonna plays a run of London dates from 27 January to 15 February, touring her latest album Madame X.\n\nNext, purveyor of swooning melodies Lana Del Rey brings Sad Girl winter to our shores (25 Feb, London to 29 Feb, Birmingham); a new album, White Hot Forever, is in the works.\n\nNick Cave & the Bad Seeds (2 May, Birmingham to 15 May, London) tour their latest double album, Ghosteen, which is largely about the death of Cave\u2019s teenage son. Its tender, intimate songs may not feel like obvious arena fillers, but the tour is set to be an emotional experience for everyone involved.\n\nDressed like a Soundcloud rapper and murmuring vaguely threatening lines about teenage hormones and death, Billie Eilish returns with her genre-shredding ASMR bangers (21 July, Manchester to 30 July, London).\n\nHe set trends, dem man copy: Michael Omari, AKA Stormzy, AKA Big Michael, returns to live music after his victorious Glastonbury headline set with a powerful second album, Heavy Is the Head (2 Sept, London to 22 Sept, Bournemouth).\n\nFinally, the Rocketman himself. After a mammoth run of dates around the world, the UK leg of Elton John\u2019s widely anticipated Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour starts and ends in London (2 Nov to 17 Dec), via various other cities, before he retires from live performance. So long, tiny dancer.\n\nKathryn Bromwich\n\n7. Film\n\nRocks\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Thrillingly alive\u2019: the cast of Rocks.\n\nA jubilant ensemble drama about a group of Hackney teenagers, Rocks was a hit on the festival circuit last year. The film\u2019s title may allude to something rough and grey but the movie is anything but \u2013 each performance is its own shimmering, incandescent diamond. Newcomer Bukky Bakray is Shola, aka Rocks, an enterprising sixth former who makes quick cash perfecting her classmates\u2019 makeup on her lunch break. When her depressed mother disappears, Rocks must temporarily assume the role of caretaker for younger brother Emmanuel (D\u2019Angelou Osei Kissiedu), simultaneously juggling lessons, friendship dramas, and the looming threat of social services. It\u2019s unclear when \u2013 or if \u2013 her mum will return.\n\nAuthored by award-winning Nigerian-British playwright Theresa Ikoko, who co-wrote the screenplay with Claire Wilson, the film is directed by Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane, Suffragette). Gavron is adamant that the film must not be referred to as Sarah Gavron\u2019s Rocks. \u201cI was a kind of facilitator,\u201d she insists, explaining that it was Ikoko who developed the story, drawing on her own experiences of growing up on an estate in Hackney. The team workshopped the film with the actors for a year before Ikoko and Wilson started writing the script. Made with a crew that skewed 75% female, the intention was to uplift and include young women from similar backgrounds as the central characters wherever possible. \u201cWe live around these girls but we don\u2019t often see them on our screens \u2013 we don\u2019t hear their stories,\u201d says Gavron. \u201cWe thought, how about building a film with them? We wanted the girls to look behind the camera and think: \u2018I could be a director, a writer, a cameraperson, a sound engineer, a production designer.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmong the film\u2019s more experienced female crew members are casting director Lucy Pardee, who has worked with Andrea Arnold, and cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart (who shot Happy as Lazzaro and Beach Rats). Even more moving than its background though is the film itself, which despite its courageous, downbeat ending is thrillingly alive in its depictions of adolescent joy.\n\nSimran Hans\n\n8. Theatre\n\nHollywood stars on the stage\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jessica Chastain will star in A Doll\u2019s House. Photograph: Hyperstar/Alamy\n\nLondon theatre holds a perennial appeal for the A-lister who wants to prove their acting credentials \u2013 but by any standards, 2020 is a bonanza year for big names. The Old Vic kicks off with Daniel Radcliffe in Beckett\u2019s Endgame in January, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet arriving for Amy Herzog\u2019s 4000 Miles in April. In the West End, Jessica Chastain stars in a production of Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House at the Playhouse in June, while in March, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke will make her West End debut there in Chekhov\u2019s The Seagull, adapted by Anya Reiss and directed by Jamie Lloyd. Jake Gyllenhaal brings his acclaimed performance in Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park With George to the Savoy come June. At the Young Vic, Cush Jumbo takes on the big one: see her Hamlet from July. In the same month, the actual Whoopi Goldberg really does get back in the habit as Sister Act hits the Hammersmith Apollo. And it\u2019s not just Hollywood actors: West Wing screenwriter Aaron Sorkin brings his Broadway-conquering adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird to the Gielgud theatre from May.\n\nHW\n\n9. Comedy\n\nLazy Susan\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Freya Parker (right) and Celeste Dring, AKA Lazy Susan. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\nComedy sketch duo Freya Parker and Celeste Dring, AKA Lazy Susan, are describing their feelings about being named rising stars in 2020 by this paper. \u201cWe\u2019re glowing,\u201d deadpans Dring. \u201cBuoyant. It\u2019s tricky to get things done because we keep floating up off the floor.\u201d\n\nTrying to interview the pair involves separating fact from their flights of fancy. \u201cWe\u2019re both from showbiz dynasties,\u201d claims Dring. \u201cOur parents are clowns.\u201d\n\nParker picks up the baton: \u201cAnd we met at Eton. It\u2019s a heartwarming riches-to-riches story.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve actually been writing and performing together for five years, after being introduced by a mutual friend when they\u2019d left university and were \u201cdoing bits and bobs\u201d in fringe theatre. \u201cWe started off trying to write a play together but it was so bleak and awful, I shudder when I think of it,\u201d cringes Parker. \u201cWe kept dicking around doing characters instead, so we accidentally began writing comedy.\u201d\n\nLast year, the duo released a well-received sketch show pilot on BBC iPlayer, which then got a terrestrial airing on BBC2. It was based on their sellout Edinburgh run, which sent up post-#MeToo sexual anxiety and saw them greet the audience with: \u201cGood afternoon, ladies and predators!\u201d This year, more TV projects beckon, but they\u2019re currently top secret. \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely be seeing more of us in 2020,\u201d says Parker.\n\nParker grew up in Teesside, worshipping Vic and Bob (\u201cThey were like gods in the north east\u201d). Dring comes from Wolverhampton, where her early comedic influences were Nickelodeon cartoon Rocko\u2019s Modern Life and 1999 beauty pageant comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous: \u201cIt\u2019s got a dynamite cast and was the first time I saw lots of women being funny together, so it was an important film for me.\u201d\n\nThe Lazy Susan name can be a bit of a liability when it comes to the opposite sex. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke that lame men make,\u201d explains Parker. \u201cWhich one\u2019s lazy and which one\u2019s Susan? Hur-hur-hur.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, Are you single?\u201d trills Dring sweetly. \u201cBut I like it because it\u2019s both an object and sounds like a description of a woman.\u201d Parker chips in: \u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s got a Z in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not playing Scrabble, mate,\u201d says Dring.\n\nAs well as having projects together in the pipeline, they\u2019ll both be popping up elsewhere in TV comedy this year. Parker is among the ensemble cast of BBC Two\u2019s The Mash Report. \u201cIt\u2019s coming back in spring and I\u2019m chuffed to be part of it,\u201d she grins. \u201cThese are dark times, so we need satire more than ever at the moment.\u201d\n\nDring plays Princess Eugenie in royal sitcom The Windsors. \u201cWe just shot the new series, which airs next month,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to watch it to see if there are any scenes set in Pizza Express in Woking.\u201d No sweat.\n\nMichael Hogan\n\n10.

Photograph: Cheryl Mann/The Music Center\n\nWith Woolf Works (2015), Wayne McGregor pioneered a new form of full-length narrative ballet that yoked together three contrasting acts under one banner. His latest epic piece for the Royal Ballet, where he is resident choreographer, sounds even more ambitious: a journey inspired by Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy, moving from Inferno, through Purgatorio to Paradiso, with a newly commissioned score by Thomas Ad\u00e8s that is symphonic in scale, and designs by the artist Tacita Dean. McGregor\u2019s muse Edward Watson stars, alongside Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball at the Royal Opera House (6 May - 1 June). Inferno premiered in Los Angeles in 2019, where it was warmly received; much anticipation surrounds the completed piece.\n\nSarah Crompton\n\n11.

Such podcasts have tended to be American (NPR even launched a specific \u201clife kit\u201d strand around a year ago), but now the UK is joining in. Elizabeth Uviebinen\u00e9 and Yomi Adegoke, authors of the best-selling Slay in Your Lane, are launching Slay: How to Succeed in Your Career; Alex Holder, whose book Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life was another hit this year, will be bringing out Awkward Conversations About Money. (Both of these will be on Audible.) Money 101, presented by Bea Duncan, another \u201chow to manage your finances\u201d show, this time aimed at young adults, will be coming out in January on BBC Sounds.

Film\n\nDirector Fyzal Boulifa\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fyzal Boulifa photographed in Paris by Wiame Haddad for Observer.\n\nFyzal Boulifa is a hard man to pin down for an interview. When his schedule finally permits a moment on the phone, he\u2019s up in the mountains at France\u2019s Les Arcs film festival, the latest stop in a crammed festival tour. The Paris-based Brit arrived directly from Marrakech, following visits to Macao and London, for the British independent film awards, where he was nominated for best debut director. \u201cI haven\u2019t been home in a couple of weeks,\u201d he says, sounding sprightlier than you might expect. \u201cI\u2019m honestly excited to get back tomorrow and do laundry.\u201d\n\nBoulifa is busy promoting his first feature, Lynn + Lucy, a shattering study of female friendship riven by tragedy and community gossip. An exercise in subtly stylised social realism set in a working-class, predominantly white pocket of Essex, it\u2019s not the breakthrough film many people expected Boulifa \u2013 the gay, Leicester-born son of Moroccan parents \u2013 to make after his last two shorts won top prizes in Cannes.\n\nBut Boulifa delights in surprising people. \u201cDiversity can be a poisoned chalice,\u201d he says. \u201cIdentity politics are very primary right now: people in the industry have ideas of who you are and where you come from, and expect the stories you tell to directly use that cultural currency. We\u2019re in a progressive moment, but there can be a regressive side to that.\u201d\n\nHe sees Lynn + Lucy, inspired by a real-life Bristol case that made tabloid headlines, as his lateral way of processing the society he grew up in, but he has no interest in declaratively personal or autobiographical work. He describes the late German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder as his greatest inspiration, \u201cbecause none of his films were definitive \u2013 each was its own strange object\u201d.\n\nWith that in mind, he\u2019s developing two very different follow-up projects: the first a Moroccan-set drama drawn loosely from family lore, the second a teen horror film based on a Junji Ito manga. Having dropped out of film school to take a more self-taught route into the business \u2013 \u201cI needed to make my own mistakes,\u201d he laughs \u2013 he\u2019s been mostly settled in Paris since attending a film-makers\u2019 residence and meeting his boyfriend there in 2013. The French film world, he says, is less gatekeeper-oriented than the British industry. \u201cAnd with Brexit\u2026\u201d his voice trails off, no follow-up needed. He is, as I said, not a man to be pinned down.\n\nGL\n\n13. TV\n\nBig hitters coming back\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brian Cox as Logan Roy in Succession.

Film\n\nClassy action movies\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nFor fans of super-luxe lifestyle porn and extravagant stunts featuring (and frequently damaging) the world\u2019s most beautiful travel destinations, a new James Bond movie is always a cause for celebration. The latest in the series, No Time to Die, out 3 April, sees Bond stepping back from active service, only to clash with a new breed of 00 agent and a heavily armed, tech savvy villain. Locations include Italy, Norway and the Scottish Highlands; and Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective) directs.\n\nAnother class act in the world of action is Tom Cruise, who gets to pull on his flying jacket and aviator shades once more in a sequel to Top Gun. Not much is known about Top Gun: Maverick (out 17 July), which is set 34 years after the original. But expect plenty of breathtaking aerial stunts, numerous shots of Tom Cruise grinning devilishly while driving recklessly fast, and an acknowledgment that, in the age of drones, pilots like Maverick are a dying breed.\n\nFor sheer spectacle, however, action fans should put 27 March in their diaries: that\u2019s the release date for Whale Rider director Niki Caro\u2019s lavish remake of Mulan, which promises to be a martial arts extravaganza of staggering scale and ambition. More serious in tone than other Disney live-action remakes, so think Crouching Tiger rather than Little Mermaid.\n\nWendy Ide\n\n16.

Black Country, New Road are the latest in a wave of interesting groups in this mould, following the Mercury-nominated Black Midi, Squid and Working Men\u2019s Club. Mixing sounds from post-punk and post-rock with new ideas, the seven-piece, who met at school in Cambridge, have only released two singles so far, but their live shows have been thrilling, packed affairs.\n\nThe songs help. Dark, twisting creatures powered by saxophone and violin, as well as guitar, bass, drums and synths, they\u2019re taken in peculiar directions by frontman Isaac Wood\u2019s constantly bifurcating lyrics. Sex, pop culture and gloomier matters are their primary subjects. \u201cShe flies to Paris, France, I come down in her childhood bed,\u201d begins first single, Athen\u2019s France (the misplaced apostrophe is deliberate). \u201cLeave Kanye out of this/Leave your Sertraline in the cabinet/And fuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac,\u201d wails the insistent Sunglasses.\n\nWood doesn\u2019t always do interviews, which suits BC, NR\u2019s collective spirit: saxophonist Lewis Evans and bassist Tyler Hyde speak today from their adopted home of London. Both are 21, sparky and brightly polite. \u201cIsaac didn\u2019t write lyrics before 2018,\u201d Evans starts. \u201cHe was brilliant out of nowhere. It\u2019s bizarre he\u2019s so good.\u201d Hyde agrees. \u201cWe like how what he writes feels so honest \u2013 he\u2019s not hiding behind anything. Also, they say a lot literally and texturally. They\u2019re part of the overall ensemble.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s obvious musical fluency comes from most of them having played together since they were 15 (apart from new recruit, guitarist Luke Mark); they \u201cgravitated towards each other\u201d at school, Evans says. \u201cThe music department there was amazing,\u201d he is at pains to point out. \u201cProperly funded, with brilliant teachers. It absolutely paved the way for us to do what we do now.\u201d\n\nThey were another band, Nervous Conditions, until January 2018, driven by the principles of free improvisation. Regrouping later that year with a new frontman and name (which Wood has described as meaning \u201ca good way out of a bad place\u201d) they released their first single on influential south London label Speedy Wunderground in April. Sunglasses followed in August. Both quickly sold out.\n\nFeverishly received gigs at Brixton\u2019s Windmill Club and summer festivals also helped cement who the new band were. \u201cWe were interacting, developing and even doing a lot of songwriting live \u2013 and that helped us feel confident together,\u201d says Hyde, excitedly. The new material will be released soon, she hopes. So does the whole indie scene. That dark tarmac\u2019s glistening brightly.\n\nJude Rogers\n\nBlack Country, New Road are on tour in the UK until 4 February\n\n17. Nonfiction\n\nBooks about motherhood\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deborah Orr, who died in October 2019. Photograph: Felicity McCabe/The Guardian\n\nIf 2019 was the year of the single-girl memoir, with confessional writing by the likes of Dolly Alderton (All I Know About Love) and Elizabeth Day (How to Fail) flying off the shelves, 2020 looks set to be a year of memoirs exploring a very different aspect of women\u2019s lives: motherhood.\n\nMotherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a story about her girlhood in the shadow of the Ravenscraig steelworks she both loved and hated and her escape to university. But more than that, it is a tender, unflinching account of her relationship with her difficult, controlling mother, made all the more poignant by the fact that Orr did not live to see it published (it will be out later this month).\n\nNell Frizzell\u2019s The Panic Years, out in May, explores how she grappled with that \u201cmother of all decisions\u201d that looms over almost every woman in their 30s: whether or not to have a baby. And in The Hungover Games, coming in March, Sophie Heawood describes how it feels to have an \u201caccidental\u201d baby on your own at the same life-stage - two contrasting experiences of becoming a mother that nonetheless share universal truths.\n\nCandice Brathwaite highlights another far less talked-about aspect of becoming a mother in I Am Not Your Baby Mother, out in May. Her book is an account of how, finding herself pregnant, she began to notice the way motherhood is portrayed in the British media. Where, she wondered, are all the black mothers? The experience led her to start blogging about the subject and found the initiative Make Motherhood Diverse, which aims to encourage a more inclusive depiction of motherhood in the media.\n\nLisa O\u2019Kelly\n\n18. TV\n\nTrue crime dramatisations\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Tennant as serial killer Dennis Nilsen in Des. Photograph: ITV/PA\n\nWhatever happened to fictional detectives cracking imaginary cases? The TV trend for true crime dramas will continue with a vengeance this year, starting with this week\u2019s White House Farm on ITV, which finds Freddie Fox playing gunman Jeremy Bamber.\n\nThis will be followed by Quiz from playwright James Graham and director Stephen Frears, telling the story of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u201ccough-gate\u201d cheating scandal. Its mouthwatering cast includes Michael Sheen as Chris Tarrant, Matthew Macfadyen as Major Charles Ingram and Fleabag\u2019s Sian Clifford as his wife, Diana.\n\nDavid Tennant will play Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen in ITV drama Des, while Stephen Merchant plays so-called \u201cGrindr killer\u201d Stephen Port in BBC1\u2019s The Barking Murders. There\u2019s also Salisbury, about the 2018 novichok poisonings; The Serpent, about backpacker killer Charles Sobhraj; and Honour, about the real-life \u201chonour killing\u201d of 20-year-old Londoner Banaz Mahmod.\n\nMH\n\n19. Music\n\nGreentea Peng\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greentea Peng photographed in her flat in south London by Suki Dhanda for the Observer.\n\nStep inside Aria Wells\u2019s incense-smoked flat in south London and you immediately get a waft of her character: there are mini-shrines of candles and trinkets from her travels to Mexico, India and Peru on practically every surface; one wall is plastered with posters of Hindu gods to match the Om symbol tattooed between her eyebrows; a tiny kitten named after the dancehall musician Buju Banton skitters across the floor. \u201cEverything I do, I need to find a ritual in it,\u201d she says, lighting a nub of palo santo. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be magic.\u201d\n\nThere is certainly something cosmic about her ascent. The 25-year-old singer performs as Greentea Peng, so named because she\u2019s a fan of green tea and the word \u201cpeng\u201d (peng is slang for something that\u2019s attractive, or a type of \u201chigh-grade weed\u201d), and her rise to hot tip for 2020 has been swift yet effortless. In just one year, she has gone from working behind the bar of an east London club to supporting Neneh Cherry on tour and working with Goldie and Mike Skinner.\n\nHer tracks Mr Sun (Miss da Sun) and Downers seem to capture a mood: sad summertime soul that suggests a more bohemian Amy Winehouse and a Lahndahn Lauryn Hill. \u201cI definitely feel like a London artist,\u201d she says, having moved back to the capital from Kent in her late teens. \u201cThe bleakness of it in the winter brings out something in me.\u201d Downers, in particular, evokes the isolation of the city and how you can \u201cnumb yourself to your surroundings too much\u201d.\n\nWhen we meet, it\u2019s UK election day and Wells had just put a spoken-word \u201crant\u201d called Bun Boris on YouTube. She says the next song she releases will be political, too, aiming to \u201cspark questions in people\u2019s brains\u201d \u2013 though her lyrics tend to be searching and introspective rather than didactic. \u201cA lot of music is all materialistic,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the reasons why we\u2019re in such a crisis with our young people is that our priorities are warped.\u201d\n\nSome have called her music spiritual, which Wells doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with, but it\u2019s clear that she is looking for a higher purpose. Her latest ink is a spiral on her cheek, representing \u201cthe journey from ignorance to enlightenment\u201d and an eye on her \u201cthroat chakra\u201d, so placed \u201cto make sure I always sing and remind me to communicate truthfully\u201d. Which is handy, as she\u2019ll be doing far more of it in 2020. Magical, indeed.\n\nKate Hutchinson\n\n20. Art\n\nExhibitions to look out for\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Dream (1896), The Battle of the Beaux and Belles (1896) and The Peacock Skirt (1893) by Aubrey Beardsley. Photograph: \u00a9 The J Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, \u00a9 The Barber Institute of Fine Arts, University of Birmingham, 2019 and \u00a9 Tate\n\n2020 is another sensational year for art. Three cult artists get their full due at London\u2019s Royal Academy \u2013 shadowy night painter L\u00e9on Spilliaert, fantastical illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, charismatic performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107, filling the entire RA with her provocations and spells. D\u00fcrer, Raphael and Titian all get huge surveys at London\u2019s National Gallery, along with C\u00e9zanne (RA) and Warhol (Tate Modern). The balance continues to adjust with much-anticipated retrospectives of the artists Angelica Kauffman (RA), Magdalena Abakanowicz (Tate Modern), Zanele Muholi (Tate Modern) and Haegue Yang (Tate St Ives).\n\nBut the show of the year, at the National Gallery, has to be the greatest heroine of them all \u2013 Artemisia Gentileschi, Italian baroque painter, precocious successor to Caravaggio, self-reliant traveller and sometime visitor to London. Courageous witness against her rapist in court, Gentileschi painted some of the strongest women in art \u2013 defiant victims, fiery warriors, and herself in different guises. Her speciality was the story of Judith beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, who was about to destroy her city. This will be a lightning strike of a show \u2013 and, amazingly, our first in this country.\n\nLaura Cumming\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Every few years the PlayStation 3 evolves, with seamless inevitability, into the PlayStation 4, and so on, each numerical tick of the counter promising fertile turf from which previously inconceivable video game miracles will sprout. This year will mark the next round of the so-called console wars, as Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 competes with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X (destined to be confused by bewildered grandparents with the current Xbox One X). Like Blur v Oasis, or Star Wars v Star Trek, the true beneficiaries of this kind of tribalistic framing of capitalist enterprise will, surely, be the companies behind the products. As in the past, the rival machines will likely be equivalently powerful and share many of the same games.\n\nIn an attempt to lure consumers toward their product, Microsoft has pinned its hopes on the closest thing the company has to an exclusive mascot: Master Chief. Halo Infinite hopes to do for the Xbox Series X what Halo did for the original Xbox in the distant technological plains of 2001. That the ageing space marine might convince the zoomer generation to glance away from Fortnite long enough to marvel at the high-definition sheen of his extremely 2000s-era space armour is perhaps doubtful. (Sony is yet to confirm any exclusive games of its own for the PlayStation 5.)\n\nAs in the film industry, in 2020 video game companies continue to invest the majority of effort and expense to provide old, nostalgia-commanding games with a lick of digital paint. Chief among the renovations is Final Fantasy VII Remake, a vastly expensive project to rebuild the dearly beloved, eco-terrorism-themed 1997 adventure game for modern audiences. Final Fantasy VII is, to a generation of ageing millennial video game nerds, a cultural monolith that, like Star Wars before it, continues to cast a long and consuming shadow over entire identities. So great is the task at hand that the publisher has split the remake into a series of chapters, to be released in stages. How and when the project ends will, no doubt, depend on the success or failure of the opening gambit.\n\nThose eager to return to the virtual worlds of their younger days will be similarly delighted by Half-Life: Alyx. It may not be quite the homecoming to City 17 that Half-Life\u2019s faith-keeping fans have clamoured for since 2004, when the last mainline entry to the series was released, but, as a fully featured and exquisitely lavish virtual reality game, this may be a more interesting prospect. You\u2019ll just need a PC of climate-change-quickening-power in order to run the thing.\n\nThis year will not only see eager returns to dusty franchises. Cyberpunk 2077, a Blade Runner-esque role-playing game starring a digital Keanu Reeves, is the standout attraction of the year. Made by CD Projekt Red, the well-regarded Polish studio behind The Witcher series (an adaptation of which launched on Netflix in December), expect a slickly finished game that allows its players to pick a unique way through the humming city, according to individual whim or character. Regardless of your chosen approach, however, expect a certain baseline of bespattered violence. So, too, in The Last of Us: Part II, the next game from Sony\u2019s cinematically minded, multi-Bafta-winning studio Naughty Dog. Here you\u2019ll play as 19-year-old Ellie, a likable, if troubled teenager who, having survived the various traumas of the first game, must now contend with a death cult operating in a post-apocalyptic United States.\n\nIf all this sounds too stressful in a world that feels, so often, as if it\u2019s spiralling towards a similar bloody endgame, Microsoft Flight Simulator will offer serene pleasures as you yoke and yaw your way through unblemished skies. Or, if you prefer to conjure your own escapism, Dreams, from the British studio and LittleBigPlanet series creator Media Molecule, provides all of the creative tools required to fashion a soothing reality of your own.\n\nIf that sounds like too much effort, opt for the long-delayed Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which will allow you to retreat to a virtual village and live out your days in harmony (or passive aggressive co-dependency: no judgment here) with a community of jabbering animals, while you pay off your mortgage via pastoral errands.

Suicide is an awkward subject, but director Milo Rau is not one to shy away from society\u2019s ugly corners. Mesmerising and alarming, Familie completes a trilogy that began with Five Easy Pieces, in which children told the story of child molester Marc Dutroux, and La Reprise, which reconstructed the murder of Ihsane Jarfi in a random act of homophobic violence.\n\nThis play also takes its template from real life. In 2007, the four members of the Demeester family were found hanged in their Calais home. They had a meal ready to eat and left no sign of struggle. The only clue to the joint suicide of this comfortably off family was a terse note: \u201cWe messed up. Sorry.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not much to go on, but Rau turns the enigma into a strength. Working with a mix of professional and amateur actors in accordance with his 10-point Ghent Manifesto, he enlists a real family to imagine the fateful final night. Prominent Belgian actors An Miller and Filip Peeters are joined by their teenage daughters Leonce and Louisa Peeters, plus dogs Billy and Bobby, in an evening not of histrionics and grinding of teeth (for that, Rau would direct you to Romeo and Juliet), but of heartbreaking banality.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guilelessness \u2026 Familie\u2019s real-life family cast. Photograph: Michiel Devijver\n\nThe production it most closely resembles is Vanishing Point\u2019s Interiors, a dark domestic comedy performed behind the windows of a single-storey house that turned the audience into unwitting voyeurs. Likewise, Anton Lukas\u2019s realistic set for Familie allows dad to get on with the cooking, mum to call her parents and the kids to do their English homework as if, for the most part, we\u2019re not there. Moritz von Dungern\u2019s deftly integrated live video projections pull us closer to their everyday routines. One section is called \u201cKilling Time\u201d.\n\nBy rights, a play shorn of everything we expect of a night out \u2013 drama, conflict, debate \u2013 should be excruciating, but such is the guilelessness of the four actors, the apparent spontaneity of their stage life and the excruciating tension of knowing their fate, that the mundane becomes riveting. In its opening and closing sequences, the cunningly crafted piece reels off lists of private pleasures: watching movies on a rainy day, doodling during a phone call, reading Harry Potter\u2026 On their own, they are whimsical and insignificant, but cumulatively, they are the reason we keep on keeping on, our way of defying existential despair.\n\nWe love this family in the way we love the talking heads on Gogglebox, not for their exceptionalism but the very reverse: their ordinariness and lack of pretence. That we are seeing enactments of real family relationships in parallel to the true-life tragic tale adds to our distress.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everyday banality and no \u2018to be or not to be dilemma\u2019 \u2026 Milo Rau\u2019s Familie. Photograph: Michiel Devijver\n\nRau does not concern himself with fathoming a meaning behind the suicides; there is no \u201cto be or not to be\u201d dilemma. He accepts the Demeesters\u2019 actions are unknowable. Even with more information, we would still find their deaths inexplicable. Where would guessing get us?\n\nInstead, he offers us a kind of dark, secular mass, at once a celebration of all life has to offer in its smallest, most trivial moments, and a painful recognition that sometimes it can be too much. Performed at the stately pace of a slow piece of Bach, Familie is assured, soulful and unnerving.\n\n\u2022 At NTGent, Ghent, Belgium, until 22 May.\n\n\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247.

A 50-minute drive from central Johannesburg, it\u2019s home to more than 1.6 million people, with famous ex-residents including former president Nelson Mandela. You can explore the buzzing township by car or bike, but the best way to soak up the heady vibrancy is by getting out on two feet: down a beer with the locals, take in a show at the Soweto Theatre, or brave the Soweto Towers bungee jump. The thriving township also has sites of incredible cultural significance, including the Hector Pieterson Museum and Mandela House, Mandela\u2019s former home, which was set on fire twice by the apartheid-era police. The walls outside are still riddled with bullet holes.\n\nThe ultimate safari\n\nKruger national park; luxury at Earth Lodge\n\nIt\u2019s a decent drive \u2013 just under five hours \u2013 from Johannesburg to Kruger national park, but the schlep is more than worth it. As well as being one of the greatest places to see Africa\u2019s big five \u2013 lions, leopards, buffalo, elephants and rhinos \u2013 the national park heralds some spectacular safari sightings, such as hundreds-strong herds of elephants trumpeting and wallowing in vast waterholes.

It\u2019s six and a half hours to iSimangaliso wetland park, South Africa\u2019s first world heritage site and a place of unparalleled natural beauty. Here, you\u2019ll find a collection of rare swamp forests, Africa\u2019s largest estuary and some of the world\u2019s highest coastal vegetated dunes, which date back 25,000 years. This is a haven for marine mammals, and you\u2019ll find humpbacks, southern right whales and frisky pods of bottlenose dolphins in these inky waters. The place to stay is the breathtaking Kosi Forest eco-lodge, lit almost entirely by candles.

Then, it\u2019s a two-hour drive to the indomitable Drakensberg mountains. This epic 600-mile chain of crumpled crags, yawning valleys, vast wildflower-strewn plains and the world\u2019s second-highest waterfall is a heart-juddering sight. A drive here involves high elevation and hairpin passes \u2013 including the Sani Pass, a steep road rising an awe-inspiring 2,876m (9,400ft) above sea level \u2013 but you\u2019ll be rewarded with spectacularly beautiful wilderness areas, such as Champagne Valley, replete with rolling mountain scenery, where you can hike, mountain bike or even rock-climb if you\u2019re feeling adventurous.\n\nWind your way down the wild coast\n\nThe Sani Pass; the Hole in the Wall\n\nHead back to the east coast \u2013 through rural Xhosa heartland \u2013 and then follow the road south; you\u2019ll soon find yourself on the route of South Africa\u2019s ruggedly beautiful Wild Coast, a 155-mile stretch of unspoiled coastline taking in rocky headlands, lagoons and powder-soft sand beaches.

An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world\u2019s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.\n\nSurfing, whales and dolphins\n\nWith miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa\u2019s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade \u2013 try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf \u2013 will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.\n\nHit the water to surf or whale watch\n\nFrom May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde\u2019s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn\u2019t enough, you can often spot dolphins diving in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina; the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time\u2019s environmental research.\n\nAdventures in food\n\nOceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you\u2019ll find a neat cross section of the city\u2019s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha\u2019s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.\n\nBunny chow; macaroons at Sugarlicious\n\nBut when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don\u2019t leave without braving the famous \u201cbunny chow\u201d: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You\u2019ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (\u00a34.19).\n\nIt\u2019s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It\u2019s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.\n\nForests, nature reserves and secluded beaches\n\nThere\u2019s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.\n\nSoweto to the sea: the magical road trip from Johannesburg Read more\n\nA 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You\u2019ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers\u2019 market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa\u2019s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views \u2013 of breaching whales and the ocean \u2013 but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there\u2019s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.\n\nAnother 30 minutes\u2019 drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort\u2019s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.\n\nInto the heart of the country\n\nSouth Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours\u2019 drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.\n\nOn the beach at Umhlanga; the rugged Drakensberg mountains\n\nOr head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.\n\nSo now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow?

The jagged mountains around Stellenbosch and Franschhoek make ideal Mediterranean-like microclimates for vines, but there\u2019s more to this area than just sampling the pinotage. The best way to take it all in? Fly direct with British Airways, pick up a hire car from Avis and hit the open road, pitstopping at the region\u2019s boutique hotels so you can take time to savour the local history and scenery. And the wine. Let\u2019s not forget the wine.\n\nCape crusader\n\nThe buzzing university town of Stellenbosch is full of oak-lined streets (it\u2019s not called the \u201ccity of oaks\u201d for nothing) and pretty whitewashed Cape Dutch houses. Work up an appetite (your stomach will thank you later) by going for a hike through the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, which has routes for everyone from seasoned hikers to only-brought-trainers types. Then head to Jordan, the restaurant on the Jordan Wine Estate, for lunch. Here, acclaimed South African chef George Jardine serves up smokey yellowtail, steamed Saldanha mussels, and a springbok pot roast. Don\u2019t leave without picking out your farm-made Karoo blue from the walk-in cheese room.\n\nStellenbosch vineyards; lunch at Jordan; typical Dutch-style architecture\n\nTake a post-prandial stroll down memory lane, AKA the historic Dorp Street, popping into the museums, art galleries and coffee shops. Make sure you visit Oom Samie se Winkel general trading store \u2013 a Stellenbosch institution. Then check out what\u2019s on at the Oude Libertas Amphitheatre \u2013 an open-air concert venue with views of the mountains and vineyards. Finally, bed down in Oude Werf, a boutique hotel in the heart of Stellenbosch. With its mix of period features \u2013 fireplaces, roll-top baths \u2013 and modern touches such as an outdoor pool, this makes the perfect base to explore the Winelands.\n\nHumpback whales, \u2018bunny chow\u2019 and golden beaches: why you should visit Durban Read more\n\nVine romance\n\nAfter a hearty breakfast of smoked Franschhoek salmon trout and peppered eggs at the hotel, it\u2019s time to hit the wine route. There are more than 100 wineries waiting just outside Stellenbosch, but the best have something more to offer than just a glass (or two). Elevate the experience by going to a chocolate and wine tasting at the Waterford Estate. Here, chief winemaker Kevin Arnold has teamed up with chocolatier Richard von Geusau, creating the perfect cocoa treats for guests. Then drive to Middelvlei Wine Estate for a plate of boere tapas (farmers\u2019 tapas) including snoek (a type of mackerel), pat\u00e9 and boerewors (farmers\u2019 sausage). Here, you can also enjoy a wine-blending experience, where you can make your own wine and get a personalised label to bring the bottle home. That\u2019s all your holiday presents sorted. And don\u2019t forget to thank your designated driver \u2013 they selflessly made it possible for you to enjoy all the wine on offer, after all.\n\nChocolate and wine tasting at the Waterford Estate (left); Eike restaurant\n\nDon\u2019t linger too long, as you\u2019ll want to be sober for your Segway tour of Spier Wine Farm, where you can enjoy the views of the mountains turning red at sunset. Park up at Oude Werf hotel then walk back to town for pre-dinner drinks at Craft Wheat & Hops (if you need a break from the vino) and then dinner at Eike on Dorp Street. Even if South African TV chef Bertus Basson isn\u2019t around, his 12-course tasting menu of nostalgic dishes such as bobotie (a South African moussaka) is a local celebrity in its own right.\n\nRoad trip\n\nGrab a croissant at the bakery/cafe Schoon Manufactory and then hit the road for one of the best drives of your life. The winding route from Stellenbosch to Franschhoek through the Helshoogte Pass is photo-opp central. You\u2019ll pass mile after mile of vineyards set against the towering Groot Drakenstein mountains. Once you\u2019ve had your picture fix, make your way into town for lunch at Foliage, where ingredients such as wild mushrooms and edible flowers are foraged from the valley, then check in to Leeu Estates. This hip hotel is nestled on the slopes of the Dassenberg with 17 rooms and an impressive art collection. Although you\u2019re surrounded by mountains and rolling vineyards, you\u2019re still just a three-minute drive from Franschhoek\u2019s pretty high street.\n\nThe Groot Drakenstein mountains; the Franschhoek Wine Tram; Leeu Estates\n\nPark the car and hop on the Franschhoek Wine Tram to La Motte \u2013 the beautiful grounds include an art gallery, a wine-tasting hall and an excellent restaurant. Don\u2019t miss Boschendal, one of the oldest wine estates in the country where you can sip their signature pinot noir and chardonnay blend under giant fruit trees. Complete your days of indulgence with dinner at the Haute Cabri\u00e8re at the Haute Cabri\u00e8re wine estate in the hills overlooking Franschhoek. It would be rude not to order the six-course taster menu with wine pairing \u2013 just be prepared for the owner to open the wine with a sabre.

It\u2019s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.\n\nHead to the whale watching capital of South Africa\n\nWhale watching at Hermanus\n\nHumpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline \u2013 keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September \u2013 when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers \u2013 and there\u2019s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you\u2019re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you\u2019ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.\n\nDive into the Serengeti of the sea\n\nA 40-minute trundle down the road, you\u2019ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks.

As well as the Cango Caves \u2013 an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites \u2013 Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.\n\nBliss out on the water\n\nKnysna lagoon (left); Tsala Treetop Lodge\n\nHead almost due south towards the coast and you\u2019ll soon reach Knysna \u2013 a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you\u2019ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads.

Grace Wales Bonner, a much hyped designer who has dressed the Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it over 40 years ago.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bonner\u2019s collection drew heavily on the colours of the Jamaican flag Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BFC/Getty Images\n\nLinley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto\u2019s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for Lovers Rock parties. The soundtrack \u2013 put together by Jamie XX \u2013 was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken.\n\nThe collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a poloneck \u2013 a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women\u2019s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling.\n\nThe colours of the Jamaican flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner\u2019s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest \u2013 be it Lovers Rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie \u2013 into clothes that people want to wear.\n\nAfter the show, Wales Bonner \u2013 a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show \u2013 explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, \u201cinevitable\u201d because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father\u2019s experiences in London in the 70s. \u201cI was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,\u201d she said. \u201cI was looking at John Goto\u2019s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The show featured polonecks, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BFC/Getty\n\nThe 29-year-old designer saw a difference between that era and her own. \u201cI feel like there was an optimism and irreverence [then] which meant that you could sample and mix cultural references in a nonchalant way,\u201d she said. Wales Bonner\u2019s sterling work could perhaps encourage a new generation to do the same.\n\nLast year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFC/Vogue Fashion Fund prize \u2013 an investment of \u00a3200,000 \u2013 in May. The designer\u2019s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner\u2019s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand\u2019s cruise collection in April. She also partnered with Solange on a performance art happening, Devotional Sound, in New York.\n\nWales Bonner highlights the work of other people of colour excelling in their field. Recent posts on her Instagram include a clip of poet London Kwesi Johnson reciting his piece Inglan is a Bitch in 1980, Bowling paintings, and a notice of a talk between Wales Bonner and artist Theaster Gates, for his show at the Tate Liverpool. Scroll further down and you\u2019ll find musicians including Steve Lacy and Jorja Smith wearing her designs. It\u2019s perhaps part of a wider vision for the designer\u2019s label.\n\n\u201cIt is my ambition to build a brand that comes from a black cultural perspective and has the same authority, presence and impact as any esteemed European house,\u201d she said to Vogue in May. \u201cIn the long term, I want Wales Bonner to exist on that same level.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/06/five-ways-to-cure-and-prevent-chapped-lips", "published": "2020-01-06T06:00:22", "title": "Five ways to cure and prevent chapped lips", "text": "Don\u2019t lick your lips\n\nChapped lips are common in winter, says Daniel Glass, a consultant dermatologist at the Dermatology Clinic, because of exposure to cold air outside and dry, centrally heated air inside. \u201cKeratin, which forms the top layer of your skin, loses its flexibility and the lips become sore, cracked and scaly,\u201d he says. \u201cMany patients who have chapped lips are lip-lickers. Repeated licking can remove the oily surface film that protects the lips from losing moisture, leading to lips cracking. The digestive enzymes in saliva can also irritate the lips.\u201d\n\nUse lip balm\n\n\u201cYou want a lip balm that has emollient properties, smoothing the surface of the skin and acting as an occlusive agent, locking in moisture,\u201d says the cosmetic dermatologist Sam Bunting. \u201cI like lanolin and petroleum, which do both. If you are skiing or hitting the beach this winter, you\u2019ll want the addition of SPF, as lips burn easily.\u201d Reapply lip balm every few hours and before bed, \u201cas many of us with colds will mouth-breathe during sleep, which is very drying\u201d.\n\nConsider supplements\n\nSome medication, such as isotretinoin \u2013 better known under the brand name Roaccutane and used for the treatment of acne \u2013 can cause dry lips. \u201cA recent paper showed that gamma linoleic acid [an oil found in plants] and evening primrose oil supplements may improve the quality of the skin on the lips while taking isotretinoin,\u201d says Glass, but he adds that it is not clear if these supplements would help people not taking the drug. It may be worth a try.\n\nWatch what else you\u2019re using\n\n\u201cLip balms can sometimes contain ingredients such as camphor and menthol, which create a pleasant, tingly \u2018active\u2019 sensation when applied,\u201d says Bunting. \u201cBut they can irritate, leading to lips, paradoxically, getting drier with use, so I don\u2019t recommend them. And if you use actives-based skincare, such as retinol, be sure to barrier off the lips with lip balm before applying it at night to avoid flaky, irritated lips.\u201d Some lipsticks can also be drying.\n\nExfoliate and moisturise\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t confuse a recurring cold sore with chapped lips. And don\u2019t ignore a non-healing scab \u2013 lips are a common site for skin cancer so get your GP to refer you to a dermatologist for further assessment,\u201d recommends Bunting. If your lips do become dry and chapped, Glass explains they \u201ccan be effectively treated by gentle exfoliation to ensure you are removing any dry, flaky skin from the surface and regularly moisturising with a good quality lip balm or moisturiser\u201d."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/red-meat-diet-modern-vegetables-lack-nutrients-fightback-veganism", "published": "2020-01-05T08:58:56", "title": "Red meat plays vital role in diets, claims expert in fightback against veganism", "text": "As millions cut out animal products, farming conference hears that fruit and vegetables have been drained of nutrients\n\nAdvocates of red meat will begin a fightback against the growth of veganism this week at the UK\u2019s biggest farming conference, with claims that eating lamb and beef is vital because some plants and fish are being drained of their nutrition.\n\nIn a speech at the Oxford Farming Conference, Alice Stanton will tell ministers, farmers and environmentalists that key nutrients in some fruits, vegetables and grains have dropped by up to 50% over 50 years.\n\nStanton, professor of cardiovascular pharmacology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said nutrition levels had dropped because farmers were trying to meet a demand for cheap food. \u201cFor plant-based foods, there\u2019s been drops in vitamins and key electrolytes by up to 50% over the past 50 years because of the genetic selection for large volume and uniformity of shape and appearance, so the things look good on the shelves. There hasn\u2019t been selection for nutrient content,\u201d she told the Observer.\n\nGrowing interest in veganism and flexitarianism \u2013 people trying to eat less meat \u2013 led to a drop in sales of red meat last year of about \u00a3185m, according to market researchers Nielsen. Research for veganuary, which promotes plant-based diets on health and ethical grounds, showed that more than 1.3 million people gave up animal products in January 2019. Retailers and food companies have launched thousands of products aimed at vegans \u2013 nearly a quarter of all launches had a vegan claim, according to Mintel \u2013 including Gregg\u2019s vegan sausage roll, vegan BBQ ribs and vegan smoked salmon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against vegetarianism or veganism,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cIt is possible to have a balanced diet with vegetarianism. It\u2019s a little bit more challenging but still possible with veganism. However, it requires a lot of knowledge and effort, which doesn\u2019t happen in the majority of the population. People don\u2019t have time to invest in getting a really balanced diet through a range of plant-based foods.\u201d\n\nLast year, the EAT-Lancet Commission, a group of 37 leading scientists, said that people in Europe and North America should reduce red meat consumption by about 80%, allowing for one beefburger and two servings of fish per week. Stanton said she \u201ctotally agreed\u201d with its proposal for people to eat more pulses, nuts, fruits and vegetables.\n\nProfessor Stanton is right that a global shift in diet from meat to plant-based food won't be easy \u2026 but it's absolutely necessary Anna Jones, Greenpeace UK\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, we need to address greenhouse gas emissions. But I\u2019m concerned about the dramatic reduction in red meat consumption being regarded as the solution,\u201d she said. Eating red meat in moderation \u2013 \u201ctwice to four times a week\u201d \u2013 was \u201cprotective against heart attacks, strokes and cancer\u201d, while nutrients in red meat were vital for children in the first three years of life, she added.\n\nStanton said plants were not the only foods declining in nutrional value. Studies also that show omega-3 fatty acid levels in Scottish farmed salmon have also dropped by half.\n\nWill Jackson, of the livestock industry body AHDB, echoed Stanton: \u201cThe key message is balance. Different food groups work best when consumed together in moderation as part of a \u2018balanced plate\u2019 approach.\u201d\n\nVegan advocates suggest buying organic food. \u201cOrganic producers often use more heritage strains of vegetables and grains that have not undergone as much selective breeding as more commercial strains,\u201d said Toni Vernelli from the organisation Veganuary.\n\n\u201cAlso, eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains to ensure you are getting a range of nutrients as well as an array of interesting tastes and textures.\u201d\n\nAnna Jones, a forestry specialist at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cProfessor Stanton is right to point out that a global shift in diet from meat to plant-based food won\u2019t be easy and isn\u2019t a solution on its own, but, given the impact of the meat industry on the climate, it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/05/could-i-go-a-year-without-buying-any-new-clothes", "published": "2020-01-05T10:00:58", "title": "Could I go a year without buying any new clothes?", "text": "It\u2019s been the great love of her life, but for Lauren Bravo the time has come to break up with fast fashion\n\nI can\u2019t remember a new year when I haven\u2019t made a resolution. Get more sleep, drink more water, drink less booze, eat more fruit, learn Spanish. But there was only one pledge I\u2019ve ever managed to stick to for longer than a few weeks, and possibly the only one that made me feel better about myself instead of worse \u2013 I broke up with fast fashion.\n\nNo new clothes (or at least no \u201cnew-new\u201d clothes) for a year. No more payday hauls or bad day pick-me-ups. No more casual flirtation with one of the most exploitative and wasteful industries on the planet. Goodbye, my problematic friend.\n\nBefore you say it, I know. Swearing off shopping shouldn\u2019t be a hardship. For plenty of people it\u2019s a default state, through lack of funds, lack of choice or just lack of interest. As a sometime-fashion journalist working in the fickle world of women\u2019s media, with trends that rise and fall on the back of a hot-or-not barometer, I know clothes take up a larger space in my life and brain than they do for the average person. But I also know so many people who feel shackled by fashion without the professional pressure; so many other women who shop as if it\u2019s a side hustle they\u2019re obliged to keep afloat. And if not buying, then browsing, scrolling, trying on, returning, thinking, thinking, always thinking about shopping.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s remarkable how many times this year men have fallen over themselves to tell me, proudly, that they never buy clothes. Never! Hate shopping! As though it\u2019s pure coincidence I picked up the message that as a woman, my clothes matter more than theirs do. Like there\u2019s no patriarchal whiff to the whole situation. Like simply opting out might not have occurred to me.\n\nOf course it\u2019s occurred to me. On all those harried shopping missions, every time the Asos scroll threatened to give me carpal tunnel syndrome, the thought would always be there in the back of my mind: why do I even care? Why does anyone?\n\nBut what the Jeremys with their homogenous, wife-bought wardrobes fail to recognise is that loving clothes isn\u2019t a character weakness to be stamped out like smoking. Clothes can be cultural currency, tribal identity and a precious tool of self-expression. An outfit can set you apart from one crowd, and win you a place in another. Virginia Woolf got it: \u201cVain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than to merely keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world\u2019s view of us.\u201d\n\nOver the years, clothes have been my comfort blanket and confidence boost. They\u2019ve been a recreational hobby, a competitive sport and a way to bond with people in pub toilets. I\u2019ve hunted for those holy grail garments the way a hardcore collector might hunt out rare stamps or action figures (then, to my shame, kept them nearly as boxfresh). I\u2019ve used clothes to draw attention to myself and I\u2019ve used them as camouflage, buying the illusion of grown-up professionalism in weekly instalments at Zara at a time when my salary barely covered my bus pass. Like Cher from Clueless, I too have a \u201cmost capable-looking outfit\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s amazing how often you can medicate trend flu with something that\u2019s already in your wardrobe\u2019: Lauren Bravo. Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer\n\nBut, of course, once you invest a thing with so much potential to make you feel good, it has equal potential to make you feel bad. Each outfit an exam, to be passed or failed. At least once a week I would have a wardrobe crisis before leaving the house; standing in my pants and flinging clothes around my bedroom, believing I had nothing to wear even as I was elbow-deep in evidence to the contrary. On those days, I would plan emergency trips to H&M at lunchtime, the way you might nip into Boots for painkillers to ease a headache. Somewhere along the way, I think I gave clothes too much power.\n\nI know I gave them too much time. And money. Once I stopped shopping, spare cash appeared in my account and periods of free time began to appear in my week. It\u2019s incredible, the things you can get done when you\u2019re not forever standing in a Post Office queue with an armful of Asos returns. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve launched a startup or finally learned Spanish, but I\u2019ve read a lot more books and had precisely zero existential crises in the changing rooms at & Other Stories. I\u2019ve watched myself rise, incrementally, out of the depths of my overdraft, with each dress and bag I haven\u2019t bought. It\u2019s progress.\n\nTo be clear: I haven\u2019t stopped shopping entirely. Charity shops have filled the gap left by the high street, along with the occasional preowned gem from eBay and Depop. But secondhand shopping is a very different beast; it\u2019s the slow-release energy to fast fashion\u2019s sugar rush. While the high street sells the idea that every shopping trip should end in a purchase, thrift stores manage your expectations. You learn to appreciate the trawl as much as the haul, getting gooey-eyed about the history stitched into each seam. Going home empty-handed feels less like defeat. You\u2019ve saved the money and still had a nice day out.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that second- hand shopping isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution. It\u2019s harder to find larger clothes in thrift shops, and the sustainable fashion world in general has a long way to go before it caters for all bodies equally. But then, so does the high street.\n\nI always knew I hated changing rooms, but it wasn\u2019t until I quit shopping that I realised just how much self-loathing lurked behind those curtains. Fast fashion made me feel as though I was failing it, every time the zip didn\u2019t do up, or the buttons gaped, or the outfit that looked chic and insouciant on the mannequin looked strange and lumpen on me. I blamed myself, my body, when in fact \u2013 and I\u2019m furious it took me 31 years to grasp this \u2013 it\u2019s the clothes that should be auditioning for you. Not the other way round.\n\nI\u2019d love to say that breaking up with fast fashion has cured the morning meltdowns. They\u2019re certainly less frequent, but the wrong recipe of weather, schedule and hormones can still tip me into sartorial crisis. And I still get struck down by \u201ctrend flu\u201d \u2013 that feverish, all-consuming need to buy some viral item you hadn\u2019t even liked the week before. This year: giant pearl hairclips, puffer jackets and the Zara dress. I went to bed and rode them all out.\n\nI also learned new tricks to eke more wear out of my existing wardrobe: like layering \u2013 an artform I\u2019d previously believed you could only do if you were Scandinavian or owned your own kiln. Turns out no! You simply take your clothes and\u2026 put them on top of other clothes. Slimfit polonecks under summery slips, shirts under short-sleeved sweaters, jumpers over dresses over jeans. Aside from one mishap with a mustard tank top and a white shirt that can only be described as \u201cDisney woodcutter\u201d, I\u2019ve had a surprisingly good success rate.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I gave clothes too much power\n\nAs so many business gurus will tell you, constraints force creativity. And when you limit your shopping options, you find yourself getting inventive with new tools instead. Sometimes superglue, sometimes scissors. My sewing skills have rusted since their GCSE Textiles heyday but since I stopped shopping, I\u2019ve started tinkering more. I\u2019ll take up a hem, change a neckline. Put press studs between the gaping buttons. When a hankering for new jeans hit last month, I unearthed an ancient pair of mid-rise stretch bootcuts \u2013 bootcut! \u2013 and chopped them into ankle-length flares. They\u2019re not exactly the jeans of my dreams, but they\u2019re close enough. And I\u2019m old enough to know by now that the jeans of my dreams don\u2019t exist.\n\nI also know I\u2019m not a \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d person. Even so, a good wardrobe cull can be cathartic, and there\u2019s a strong argument for stripping back your wardrobe to an edited selection of reliable, high-quality pieces (I can see clearly now the rayon is gone, as Johnny Nash almost sang). But it can also be counterintuitive, especially if you\u2019re not ready to swear off trends entirely. Not yet.\n\nIgnore anyone who tells you to get rid of everything you haven\u2019t worn in a year. Fashion is cyclical \u2013 come on, we know this \u2013 and no sooner have you sent a tired old trend off to the charity shop than Vogue will suddenly declare it hot again. \u201cThe most sustainable item is the one you already own,\u201d says Fashion Revolution (the global movement that scrutinises industry practices). It\u2019s amazing how often you can medicate trend flu with something that\u2019s already in your wardrobe.\n\nAnd if not yours, someone else\u2019s. Peer-to-peer rental platforms such as HURR Collective and My Wardrobe have arrived on the scene to formalise and monetise the process, the latter even hiring former Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson as chairman. Meanwhile, groups like Swap Rebellion and Swapaholics UK are hosting good old-fashioned clothes swaps on a grand scale. Sharing and borrowing from friends is a secret weapon that most of us don\u2019t take nearly enough advantage of. The wardrobe of the future is open-source; I really believe that. Especially if your Rixo dress is my size.\n\nMeanwhile, social media has taken on a new role in my life. I\u2019ve unfollowed every brand and influencer that might have led me into temptation, and let slow fashion advocates like Jade Doherty (@notbuyingnew) and Hannah Rochell (@EnBrogue) set a new pace on my feed. In a galaxy of #gifted single-wear wardrobes, their willingness to show off the same items again and again feels gently subversive.\n\nFollowing their example, I\u2019ve become a serial outfit repeater \u2013 and proud of it. I\u2019ve started to dress like a toddler who has to have their favourite jumper wrestled off them for washing. And since over-washing is another sustainability no-no (all those plastic microfibres leaching into the waterways, not to mention the ageing and fading effect), I\u2019ve shrugged off the shame along with the odd gravy stain. Nobody has said anything.\n\nIn fact, one of the more ego-bruising but ultimately liberating parts of the whole process has been realising just how little anybody cares what I\u2019m wearing \u2013 be it at a work meeting, a party or, because apparently I am this shallow, a funeral. Every time I\u2019ve pulled on the same old outfit I\u2019ve braced myself for pointed fingers, covert sniggers or disapproving scowls that haven\u2019t come. Because, and I really can\u2019t stress this enough: people do not care what you wear. Most won\u2019t even remember.\n\nI can't imagine ever going back to the high street\n\nYou will, but in a good way. Those much-loved, time-worn outfits become part of the memories; dependable series regulars rather than novelty guest stars. And that, really, is the mindset that carries you through a year without shopping. Instead of pining over my break-up with fast fashion, I\u2019m trying to focus on my relationship with the clothes I already own. Romancing them, looking after them, taking them out dancing. Reminding myself why I fell for them in the first place.\n\nIf received wisdom is to be believed, it takes half the length of a relationship to move on after a break-up. Which means I could have nearly a decade ahead of me before the thrill of a DPD delivery has completely left my system; before each invite and mood swing and season-change triggers a flashing light in my brain that reads \u201cSHOP!\u201d\n\nUnpicking the seams that bind my clothes so tightly to my self-esteem is going to take longer than a year on the wagon, but already I\u2019m at a point where I can\u2019t imagine ever going back to the high street \u2013 for all the urgently important reasons, of which there are millions, multiplying with each painful crank of the production line. But for a selfish one, too: I just don\u2019t have the energy. Not any more.\n\nNow, I\u2019m the kind of person who goes around warning others off their toxic ex. Babe, you can do so much better than fast fashion. The planet can. We all can.\n\nGo slow with fast fashion\n\nTry these top tips to kick your habit and take back control\n\n1. Detox your inbox Unsubscribe from every brand email that might lead you into temptation, and unfollow every influencer who gives you click-to-buy urges.\n\n2. Follow the leaders Scroll slow fashion influencers, such as @uncomplicatedspaces and @notbuyingnew, who delight in outfit-repeating and clever styling tricks.\n\n3. Know your triggers Think about the reasons you buy clothes you don\u2019t need and how you could change those behaviours \u2013 whether it\u2019s avoiding spendy friends or finding a route home from work that doesn\u2019t take you past your favourite shop.\n\n4. Have a dress-up session Get out everything you own, marvel at how many clothes you already have, and spend an evening trying on new combinations. It\u2019s amazing how old clothes can feel fresh again with a bit of imagination.\n\n5. Become a borrower When the urge to shop strikes, try raiding someone else\u2019s wardrobe instead. Forage from friends, go to a clothes-swapping event, or try rental platforms like HURR, NuWardrobe and Onloan.\n\nHow to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (\u00a312.99, Headline) is published on 9 January.

By 2040, people aged 50 and over are expected to be this sector\u2019s key consumer base.\n\nBut despite their spending power, the industry\u2019s institutional ageism makes this powerful demographic feel like \u201cfrumps\u201d, the research found. Women older than 75 stop spending on fashion altogether, even though they have significant savings and say they are still interested in looking stylish, according to the findings.\n\n\u2018This is what 70 looks like\u2019: the new generation of beauty influencers Read more\n\nDiane Kenwood, a ILC trustee, said: \u201cFor too long the fashion and beauty industries have been bewilderingly resistant to recognising just how fashionable and stylish the generation of older consumers are and want to remain.\n\n\u201cThe potential of these consumers is huge and it has been shamefully sidelined. I do, though, sense a shift in attitudes starting to stir, and I\u2019m hopeful that change will gather momentum.\u201d\n\nOlder models have been increasingly used in advertising during the past decade, but it has never become the norm. In 2015, Phoebe Philo, creative director at Celine, chose then 82-year-old author Joan Didion to star in a campaign. Since then, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren have modelled for L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Charlotte Rampling became the face of Nars lipstick, Joni Mitchell joined St Laurent, Lauren Hutton was brought onboard for Calvin Klein lingerie, and Julia Roberts became the face of Lanc\u00f4me.\n\nBut although a lot of the big brands \u2013 including Gucci \u2013 appear to be increasingly age-inclusive in their advertising, the issue is still sensitive. Photographer and author Ari Seth Cohen is the creator of Advanced Style, a project devoted to \u201ccapturing the sartorial savvy of the senior set\u201d. He said the fashion industry was hampered by its fear of mortality.\n\nCohen said: \u201cFashion and beauty brands have been ignoring their older customers for ages. Rather than trying to reach this savvy demographic, they prey on their insecurities and use fear and ageist propaganda to sell beauty products that promise the ridiculous and harmful ideology of \u2018anti-ageing\u2019.\n\n\u201cI have noticed a growing trend towards inclusion for older models and senior social media stars for more than a decade. There have been numerous beauty and fashion campaigns featuring silver-haired models, but I don\u2019t think brands have quite figured out what their older customers want and how to reach them.\n\n\u201cOne huge shift that seems to be making a difference is the power of older women on social media and Instagram. Rather than needing to create content specifically geared towards older consumers, brands are beginning to approach a growing population of senior content creators to make more organic and believable sponsored posts and ads focused on their own micro-communities.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, a group of models aged 47 and older protested at the opening of London fashion week against their lack of representation on the catwalk \u2013 although it was at her show there that Simone Roche cast three septuagenarians and a 50-year-old.\n\nJilly Johnson, 65, who was one of the protest\u2019s organisers, said at the time: \u201cPeople seem to think that once you reach 40, you\u2019re not interested in clothes and you don\u2019t buy anything \u2013 but that\u2019s simply not true. A huge percentage of clothes are bought by older women \u2013 so fashion is making a huge mistake by ignoring that grey pound.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/why-do-i-keep-breaking-my-resolution-to-have-a-vasectomy", "published": "2020-01-05T12:00:00", "title": "Why do I keep breaking my resolution to have a vasectomy? | Stuart Heritage", "text": "I had two new year\u2019s resolutions in 2018; to get a vasectomy and to pass my driving test. When December rolled around, I held my driving licence in my hand with satisfaction. True, I hadn\u2019t achieved both my resolutions, but partial completion isn\u2019t to be sniffed at, right?\n\nIn 2019, I also had two resolutions \u2013 to get a vasectomy and to rejoin a gym. Again, December came and, again, I only managed one of them. I\u2019m in infinitesimally better physical condition than I was a year ago, so that\u2019s the same as getting a vasectomy. Isn\u2019t it?\n\nDo you see a pattern emerging? I\u2019ve stumbled across an amazing, no-fail loophole to stop me feeling bad about never getting a vasectomy. Every year I make a plan to get it done, and every year I sidestep it by creating and executing a different resolution that I can use as a safety net for my own disappointment. Clever, isn\u2019t it? What a genius I am, tricking myself like that. Well done me for outsmarting myself so deftly at every turn.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to hear that I have two resolutions for 2020 as well. One is to take flying lessons, and the other \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 is to book an appointment for a vasectomy. Really this time. Really and truly. I\u2019m going to do it. Honestly.\n\nExcept I won\u2019t, will I? This time next year I guarantee that I\u2019ll have ploughed all my money into climate-destroying frivolity, and all because I don\u2019t like the thought of a doctor chopping my balls open.\n\nAnd this is the crux of it. Every time I edge closer towards an appointment, I see flashes of scalpels. I remember word for word how Jamie Oliver described what happened to a friend of his after a vasectomy: \u201cHe cried for three weeks! It went all black!\u201d I hear a mid-slice sneeze. I picture a steamroller bursting open a watermelon. I imagine the pain of that time my two-year-old accidentally trod on my ballsack, and I amplify it by a million.\n\nBut I should get a vasectomy. I know I should. My testicles have served their purpose. They\u2019ve brought two boys into the world \u2013 two happy, incredible little boys who make my heart sing whenever I so much as catch a glimpse of them. But at the same time I know that I would rather drive over my head in my own car than have any more. The thought of starting from scratch again, and all that it entails, fills me with dread. The sleepless nights. The constant alert. The inability to wear white clothes. The expense. The renewed exposure to Bing. I cannot. Make no mistake, my children are the joy of my life, but give me any more and swear to God I\u2019ll drown myself in a toilet.\n\nPlus, I have a feeling that a vasectomy would be good for my marriage. Because it turns out that having tangible evidence that sex leads to children is just about the greatest contraceptive ever created. Before you have kids, you can be forgiven for being a little devil may care about birth control. \u201cIf it happens it happens,\u201d you might say to each other. \u201cWe\u2019re in love! An accidental baby would be an expression of our love!\u201d But once children stop being hypothetical \u2013 once your living room has become a minefield of plastic tat and the arms of your sofa have snail-trails of snot running along them and you\u2019re constantly so tired you can feel your eyeballs vibrating inside your head \u2013 it\u2019s a different matter. Sex takes on an air of Russian roulette. My balls were benign for a long time. Now they\u2019re a pair of hand grenades.\n\nMy testicles have now served their purpose. I have two happy boys\n\nSo we have two options: either I get a vasectomy or we wait it out for the menopause. Which would be ideal for me, frankly, but a little selfish. After all, men tend to get a free ride in this field. For as long as I\u2019ve known her, my wife has been the one hurling herself into different hormonal tornadoes in the name of contraception. One pill made her gain weight. Another gave her crashing bursts of depression. An IUD resulted in bacterial vaginosis. And all the while I just stood by, secretly pleased that none of it was happening to me. Surely it\u2019s time for me to take one for the team.\n\nI have friends who\u2019ve had vasectomies. \u201cBest thing I ever did,\u201d said one. Another promised it meant \u201cminimal John Wayne walking\u201d. One of my wife\u2019s friends said a vasectomy was \u201cthe best gift a man can give a woman\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely normal,\u201d one of my closest friends told me. Like me, he\u2019d just had his second child when he decided to have a vasectomy but, unlike me, his procrastination was minimal. He told me that it made him feel \u201clike a married man again, and not just a baby factory\u201d, that it had removed so much uncertainty from his life. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t that painful. You\u2019re in, you\u2019re out and that\u2019s that,\u201d he added. So it\u2019s painless, I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say painless,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey\u2019re still your balls. They do feel quite tender for a while. But you\u2019ll have felt much worse.\u201d Looking at him, happy in the certainty that he\u2019d never have any more kids, was a revelation. He almost made it sound like a day at a theme park.\n\nBut still. The last time I seriously broached the idea, I was promoting a book. During one panel I wondered aloud whether anyone in the audience had gone through with a vasectomy. \u201cYEAH!\u201d a voice called back from the darkness. What was it like, I asked in hope more than anything else. \u201cIT REALLY HURT!\u201d the voice yelled back. And that\u2019s the voice I hear every time I think about making an appointment with my GP.\n\nJust for the record, the pain is a part of my reticence, but I\u2019m not a coward. I had my eyes lasered, for example. A sucker attached itself to my eyeball, and a laser beam fired itself into my eye until I went blind. Physically, that has to be the equal of a vasectomy, right? After all, they do say that the eyes are the balls of the face.\n\nA good friend tells me that it was the best thing he ever did\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the permanence. I never want to have any more kids ever again, but then again what if I do? I change my mind about everything all the time. There was a time when I didn\u2019t want kids, and then all of a sudden out of nowhere I really did. What if, when both my kids are at school, I find myself longing for the early days again? For all the firsts; the teeth, the steps, the words? They say you shouldn\u2019t have a vasectomy if you\u2019re under any stress. But stress has been my default for a while now. What if it\u2019s stress that\u2019s colouring my decision? Maybe, once everything straightens out, I\u2019ll welcome more children with open arms.\n\nTentatively, I arrange a call with Dr Camille Tchuinkam, the lead surgeon at Marie Stopes. He goes to great pains to denounce the myth of the painful vasectomy. \u201cThe procedure we use is the non-scalpel technique,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt reduces complications and there\u2019s very little bleeding. We make two small nicks in the scrotum, maybe 2 or 3mm long, and that\u2019s it. You\u2019d only need two days off work.\u201d\n\nI wanted to know if many people have last minute on-the-table changes of heart, but Dr Tchuinkam explained that it\u2019s quite rare. \u201cWe have a team of counsellors that patients can talk to if they have any reservations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do not perform the procedure for at least 10 days, to give the patient time to change their minds.\u201d\n\nAll this was doing a lot to ease my mind, but then he said something I will never be able to forget. \u201cIf you have young children, it\u2019s important to let them know that you need rest,\u201d he began, before telling me the story of a man who came home from a vasectomy to be greeted by his two young children who excitedly ran towards him at crotch height. \u201cHe had to go straight back to hospital,\u201d Dr Tchuinkam said, \u201cto the emergency department.\u201d\n\n\u201cMY GOD,\u201d I shouted in response, doubled over in agony on the other end of the phone at the thought of it. \u201cBut that\u2019s a rare occurrence,\u2019\u2019 he reassured me. \u201cIt\u2019s just two small nicks, and when they heal it looks like a cigarette burn.\u201d A cigarette burn. A cigarette burn.\n\nAt that point, I\u2019m not afraid to say, I was out. Of all the mental images I wanted in my head, a cigarette being stubbed out on my scrotum was way down the list. If you\u2019re a man reading this, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re now devoting your brain power to trying to avoid thinking about someone stubbing out a cigarette on your testicles. I wish I could promise that the mental image goes away, but it does not.\n\nI still have two New Year\u2019s resolutions this year. And this means I\u2019d better book some flying lessons, because I\u2019ve gone right off the idea of getting a vasectomy. There\u2019s always 2021."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/us-citizens-in-iraq-tell-us-about-your-situation", "published": "2020-01-03T14:16:57", "title": "US citizens in Iraq: tell us about your situation", "text": "We\u2019d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

On the eve of a BBC dramatisation of their story, 91-year-old survivor Arek Hersh talks about the experience\n\nOn the morning of 14 August 1945 towards the end of the second world war, 16-year-old Arek Hersh and 300 other Jewish children boarded a squadron of 10 converted Stirling bombers and took off from Prague. They were organised in groups of 30 to each aeroplane, with 15 sitting on each side on the floor. Hersh remembers it vividly: \u201cThey cut us some bread,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought it was cake. They gave us each a piece and it was great.\u201d About eight hours later, they landed at RAF Crosby-on-Eden, near Carlisle.\n\nThe children were the first intake of a pioneering rehabilitation scheme, in which boys and girls from labour and concentration camps in eastern Europe were transported to the Lake District to find new families and start afresh. Their journey has been dramatised by the screenwriter Simon Block and the result is a timely and moving BBC film The Windermere Children, starring Thomas Kretschmann and Romola Garai, to be shown this month, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nAt 91, Hersh is spry with a mischievous sense of humour. For almost half a century, he spoke to no one about his Holocaust experience. Not to his three daughters, who are old enough now not only to have kids of their own but also grandchildren. Nor to Jean, his second wife, whom he married in the early 1970s. Eventually, around 1995, Hersh decided to write it all down. The words came excruciatingly slowly. \u201cTwo lines a day,\u201d he recalls, when we meet at his comfortable home just north of Leeds. \u201cBut I wrote it, and then after that I could speak, I could talk about it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I was very, very lucky\u2019: Arek Hersh, Holocaust survivor, photographed at his home near Leeds. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nBefore the war, Hersh \u2013 Herszlikowicz back then \u2013 lived with his parents, brother and three sisters in Sieradz, a garrison town in west Poland. His father was a bootmaker, much in demand for making officers\u2019 footwear. When the Nazis invaded, they came first for Hersh\u2019s father, but he escaped; they came back for his brother, but he also slipped away. That left 11-year-old Arek, who was packed off to a labour camp near Poznan to lay lines and sleepers for the Poznan-Warsaw railway, which would speed up the German attack on the Soviet Union. One of his responsibilities was to clean the room of the camp commandant, who every day would leave Hersh a hunk of bread on his desk. It wasn\u2019t much, but Hersh believes it saved his life. \u201cWe started with 2,500 men,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin 18 months, there were only 11 of us left alive. And I was one of them. Very, very lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuck\u201d is a word that comes up again and again in Hersh\u2019s account. When he was sent to Auschwitz in 1944, he told the SS officer that he was 17 and a locksmith. He wasn\u2019t either of those things; he just wanted to suggest that he might be useful to the Nazis. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I said, and they told me to go to the right side,\u201d says Hersh. \u201cAnd 180 children all went to the wrong side. And they were murdered.\u201d\n\nThe most gruelling experience for Hersh personally, however, came in the early months of 1945, when he was evacuated first on foot, in the bitter cold, to the Buchenwald camp in Germany and finally to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia on what he calls \u201cthe train of damnation\u201d. \u201cA whole month on open wagons without food,\u201d says Hersh, shaking his head. \u201cWe ate grass. I ate the leather on my left shoe to keep going. I didn\u2019t swallow but I chewed it.\u201d\n\nYour first instinct is to try to think your way into their heads. But you realise that\u2019s impossible Simon Block, screenwriter\n\nHersh was in Theresienstadt, expecting any moment to be killed, when the camp was liberated by the Russian army on 8 May, 1945. He was moved on to Prague and it was here he was selected for the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, which was set up by the British philanthropist Leonard Montefiore, a leading figure in the Anglo-Jewish Association. Montefiore persuaded the British government to accept 1,000 displaced children aged eight to 16; the Home Office agreed on condition that the funds were found by the Jewish community. In the end 650 boys and 80 girls came over.\n\nWhat kind of physical and mental shape must these children have been in? How do you begin to repair the damage done to individuals, who in many cases were the only surviving members of large families? How do you try to imagine what they might be thinking? These were the questions that faced the therapists and educators at Windermere who were to help them in August 1945. It was also a quandary for the team behind the new drama.\n\n\u201cYour first instinct is to try to think your way into their heads,\u201d says Simon Block. \u201cBut you realise that\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t imagine what Arek, who was in four different concentration and labour camps including Auschwitz, went through. And not just for a day, but for years. You can\u2019t recreate that trauma; all you can do is reflect how their behaviour may have manifested some of that while they were at Windermere.\u201d\n\nHersh turns up the electric fire a notch and Jean walks in with a tray of tea, biscuits and cake, and instructs me with brisk hospitality to tuck in, because her husband will probably forget. On the walls are photographs of Hersh with the Queen, Prince Charles and Liza Minnelli. \u201cOh yes, she dedicated a song to me one time,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter landing at Crosby-on-Eden, Hersh and the other children were driven to the Calgarth estate in the village of Troutbeck Bridge. A mile from Windermere, it was a wartime housing scheme that had been used for workers from the Short Sunderland aeroplane factory, which had relocated there to evade the bombing. Dormitory accommodation was provided as well as single rooms for older boys, like Hersh. \u201cEach one had a bed, a chest of drawers,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was everything you needed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Survivors today, with the actors who play them in The Windermere Children (left to right): Chaim \u2018Harry\u2019 Olmer, Kacper Swietek, Arek Hersh, Tomasz Studzinski, Pascal Fischer, Ben Helfgott, Marek Wroblewski, Sam Laskier, Kuba Sprenger, Ike Alterman. Photograph: Helen Sloan/BBC/Wall to Wall/ZDF\n\nThe Windermere programme is not as well known as the Kindertransport initiative, which moved nearly 10,000 mostly Jewish children from Nazi-occupied territories to Britain between 1938 and 1939. At that time, some British politicians, including former prime minister Lord Baldwin, argued that it was a humanitarian duty. \u201cI have to ask you to come to the aid of the victims, not of any catastrophe in the natural world, not of an earthquake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut of an explosion of man\u2019s inhumanity to man.\u201d\n\nBlock sees clear parallels with today\u2019s migrant crisis. \u201cWindermere is a story of refugees and child refugees,\u201d he says, \u201cand I thought it was very pertinent considering what was going on at the time [in Calais] when we started working on it.\u201d\n\nIn 1945, the immediate priorities for the children were to get clothing and find out about their families. The Red Cross supplied clothes, but they were odd shapes and sizes, so many children walked around in their underwear for a few days until donations of garments from local families started arriving.\n\n\u201cWe started to live as normally as we could,\u201d remembers Hersh. \u201cSome kids brought us bicycles and they said, \u2018Go on, have a ride!\u2019 We didn\u2019t understand what they were saying, but they gave us a bicycle. So we went on the main road, and we were cycling on the right-hand side, so they tooted the horn like mad, shouting from the cars. We didn\u2019t know what they were shouting at us. We couldn\u2019t speak one word of English! But we caught on quite quickly, and we went to the cinemas, sixpence per seat, and it was very nice and we made our own life and things were OK.\u201d\n\nNews of their families took time to trickle through. For some there was hope, even something close to a miracle. There is a powerful moment in The Windermere Children when one of the children is reunited with a long-lost brother, who he has been told has probably died. That really happened. \u201cOh, it would be incredibly manipulative to have made that up,\u201d says Block. \u201cNo, if you have that, you wouldn\u2019t need to make anything up.\u201d\n\nFor most though, including Hersh, there was only despair. He found out his mother had been gassed and thrown into a mass grave at the Chelmno extermination camp. Of his immediate family, only his older sister Mania had survived, having escaped to the Soviet Union. There is a scene in the drama where Hersh \u2013 all the children, are played by Polish actors \u2013 hears about the fate of his family and soon after breaks up with his girlfriend. \u201cI still had so much grief,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI had lost my whole family and I felt I couldn\u2019t worry about my girlfriend as well.\u201d\n\nAt the Calgarth estate, the children received no counselling. Instead, they were encouraged to swim in the lake, play football, and given basic English lessons. \u201cThe thing about therapy obviously is that it\u2019s only any use if somebody wants to engage with it,\u201d says Block. \u201cAlmost the main point was to bring them together in one place where they could be with other people who\u2019d been through what they\u2019d been through, talk about it among themselves if they wanted to.\u201d\n\nThat was certainly Hersh\u2019s experience. \u201cThere were three or four boys I had been with in Auschwitz and Buchenwald,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were always together. So I could talk to them, because they had a similar story to mine, but not to anybody else.\n\n\u201cWe just had to suffer,\u201d he goes on. \u201cTerrible. I had about 30 years of nightmares. Middle of the night, I used to get a nightmare and so on.\u201d It was only after he had completed his book, A Detail of History, in 1998, he says, that he finally began to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s left me now. After I wrote the book actually, it left me then.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A portrait of Arek Hersh taken when he was \u2018about 18\u2019 in Liverpool after the war. Photograph: \u00a9 Arek Hersh/The Observer\n\nThe Calgarth estate programme was designed to be a temporary scheme, running for four months, after which, the younger children would be placed in the care of foster families, and the older ones would live in hostels and prepare for work. Hersh moved first to Liverpool with his friends and then Manchester. He trained as an electrician, but eventually, living in Leeds after marrying Jean, he bought and let property, mainly to students. Somewhere along the line, in the 1950s, he shortened his name from Herszlikowicz, because he was fed up with having to spell it out.\n\nBlock, who also wrote the 2015 BBC drama The Eichmann Show about the trial of Adolf Eichmann, interviewed a dozen Windermere survivors and found that most of them were \u201cvery eager to get on with life\u201d. He continues, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t bury what happened to them completely because it would come back in their sleep, in their subconscious, but they wanted families and all the rest of that. It was when they retired and they had more time to reflect that it all came barrelling back to them.\u201d\n\nHersh is now involved in education, at schools and universities, and with the charity March of the Living, which each year organises a walk between the Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps. In 2009, he was awarded an MBE. \u201cWhen I first went back to Auschwitz, it was awful for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get through the gate. But after three attempts I got through and since then I\u2019ve been going there with children and young people to show them the place.\u201d\n\nThese visits are clearly still not easy \u2013 why does he put himself through it? \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want people to think that it just happened many moons ago, and people forgot about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI talk to everybody, so young people know that what actually happened to me can happen to anybody. That\u2019s the main reason I do it.\u201d\n\nBlock found that this idea of giving something back is a recurring theme. \u201cThe Windermere children are the most patriotic people I\u2019ve ever come across,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re so grateful for the chance they got to start their lives again in the UK, and they want to express that in many ways, by being successful here and paying taxes and raising their families here.\n\n\u201cHopefully viewers will think, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not impossible to bring people here and help them rather than be scared of those who might be fleeing from terrible experiences.\u2019 We can bring them in, help them and then that\u2019s repaid many times over.\u201d\n\nThe Windermere Children will be broadcast on BBC Two later this month.\n\nOn 27 January, Holocaust Memorial Day 2020 will mark 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Dozens of shovels stuck into the muddy earth are waiting to be grabbed by newcomers, while four cordoned-off areas are already full of volunteers measuring and digging holes, before carefully planting the young seedlings, called whips.\n\n\u201cBy the time the day is done, you look around and there are thousands of trees,\u201d says Jazmin Glen, 26, a volunteer supervisor at the event. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think you might come back in however many years and there\u2019s an actual forest here that you\u2019ve been a part of creating.\u201d\n\nThe team hope to plant 9,000 trees by the end of the day, and although right now the spindly plants look half dead, Glen says they are just dormant and will start to bloom in a couple of seasons.\n\nThe day has been organised by Trees for Cities, one of the Guardian and Observer\u2019s four climate emergency appeal charities, and the only UK voluntary organisation working on a national scale to plant trees in urban areas most in need \u2013 often places that have high levels of both social and environmental deprivation.\n\n\u201cThe places that are greenest are often the wealthiest, with the best sort of social indicators,\u201d says the charity\u2019s chief executive, David Elliott. \u201cSo our work tends to focus on the more deprived parts of towns and cities, where our projects can bring a whole range of benefits to people.\u201d\n\nThese benefits include improving air quality, reducing flooding, easing noise pollution and regenerating green spaces for local communities. This particular site in Beckton is next to the busy A1020 and just across the river from London City airport.\n\nThe mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz, was also at the event and said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing that we\u2019re working with charities like Trees for Cities, because it\u2019s bringing focus to the resident population here in Newham about the importance of nature, ecology and tree planting, but also its contribution in response to the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Elliott, Trees for Cities chief executive, plants a seedling with his children. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian/Observer\n\nRecent analysis from the British Heart Foundation has found the borough to be the most polluted in the UK, and its council last year declared a climate emergency. Yet while the environmental benefits are obvious, they don\u2019t reflect the joy many young people experience on getting involved in tree planting.\n\n\u201cWhen we work on big estates, for example, you get young people coming out and engaging with stuff that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to do. It\u2019s very powerful, actually,\u201d says Elliott.\n\nJackson Pereira from nearby East Ham is at the event with his family, including his young daughters, Amelia and Ava, and nieces, Harshini and Lassyhani. He says there aren\u2019t many woodland areas near their home for the kids to run around in, so he\u2019s keen to contribute to creating more green spaces for children in cities to enjoy and learn from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said to them, \u2018When you\u2019re Daddy\u2019s age, and you come back here, it will look totally different.\u2019 Amelia has already said she\u2019s going to mark her tree and she wants to climb it once it\u2019s high enough.\u201d\n\nThere are many children attending from local beavers and other scout groups, benefiting from an experience they can\u2019t get in a classroom. Harshini, aged seven, says: \u201cNow we know we shouldn\u2019t waste paper and we know how hard it is to grow a tree.\u201d\n\nThe family hopes the event will make a lasting impact on the youngsters, like it did for Yanis, who was 13 when he attended a Trees for Cities planting session in Seven Kings Park, in the neighbouring borough of Redbridge, last year. He enjoyed it so much he joined the Orchard Leaders club at his secondary school, through which he planted trees every Friday after school on a nearby field.\n\n\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t really want to go, I just wanted to sit at my computer, but as I went on I realised that it\u2019s a very important problem, and also it\u2019s actually very enjoyable,\u201d he says.\n\nHis mother, Bego\u00f1a Belmonte, said she was proud of her son: \u201cHe did it over the winter period, as well. Which is very commendable because of the cold and the wet.\u201d The next tree planting session in their area is scheduled for March. \u201cI really loved the experience of being involved with Trees for Cities, and I wish there were more local projects we could participate in.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jackson Pereira, centre, and members of his family. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian/Observer\n\nMost volunteers agree the best thing about these events is being able to turn serious concern over the climate crisis towards a productive end. Elliott says: \u201cI suppose the beauty of tree planting is it\u2019s a real practical thing and you can see, from the beginning to the end of the day, the difference you\u2019ve made. Hopefully those trees will be there for hundreds of years, helping to constantly improve the environment. We\u2019re offering something which is really tangible.\u201d\n\nFor Abbas Ali, a 24-year-old auditor who lives in Canary Wharf, it\u2019s a welcome opportunity to spend time out among nature, meeting other people. \u201cI think that\u2019s something everyone misses when they live in London \u2013 it\u2019s a breath of fresh air,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t participate in Extinction Rebellion because it\u2019s a bit intense. So this is something that I care about and it\u2019s also a really good way to spend your Saturday. I would probably just be watching TV otherwise.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future, Elliott says the main focus of Trees for Cities will be training and empowering the next generation of young people, whether individuals or community groups. \u201cWe want to give them the motivation, the ideas, the resources and knowhow to go out and start taking ownership of their local spaces, doing tree planting and greening projects themselves.\u201d\n\nVolunteer supervisor Glen is one of those young planters keen to do her bit to help save the planet. \u201cThere are so many different things that need to come together to tackle such a big problem,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice to feel like you are doing something towards helping.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Guardian and Observer\u2019s climate emergency appeal ends at midnight on 12 January"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/iran-us-diplomacy-possible-qassem-suleimani-killing-avoid-war", "published": "2020-01-05T20:03:32", "title": "Diplomacy over Iran is still possible \u2013 if only to avoid an all-out war", "text": "Tehran has vowed revenge for the killing of Qassem Suleimani but conflict is not yet certain\n\nDiplomacy over Iran is still possible \u2013 if only to avoid an all-out war\n\nThe threats emanating from Twitter feeds and podiums in Tehran and Washington might suggest the moment for diplomacy has long passed, and some form of war between the US and Iran following the assassination of Qassem Suleimani is now inevitable.\n\nThe only consideration that might hold the two sides back is the possible consequences. Tehran has tasted the unpredictability of Donald Trump and however much the desire for revenge beats in the hearts of Iranians, European leaders are pleading with Tehran\u2019s leadership, saying it has a responsibility to use its head and recognise any direct attack on US assets in the Middle East is likely to be met with a further escalation by Trump.\n\nA number of European diplomats privately say it is notable that among the chants of \u201cdeath to America\u201d, some Iranian military leaders have spoken more cautiously about a response, stressing it will occur at a time and on a target of Iran\u2019s choosing. For the past year, Tehran has conducted attacks on the US and its allies through plausible deniability, using proxies and militias. A full-frontal assault on Washington by the Revolutionary Guards would be suicidal. The US has about 60,000 troops in the region, including about 5,200 in Iraq.\n\nThose sums may give diplomats the narrowest window of opportunity to try to de-escalate the crisis. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, is heading to the US on a pre-arranged visit and will press the White House to think more strategically about its involvement in the Middle East. Many in the Pentagon will be privately urging the same.\n\nThe EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has also invited the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to Brussels, and it is possible Tehran will take up the offer. The EU has been rightly criticised in the past for being insufficiently active in the Middle East.\n\nThere are also lines of communication open to Tehran via Oman, Japan or through the Swiss embassy \u2013 the formal conduit for communications between Tehran and Washington.\n\nIran may also calculate that it has political as well as military avenues to pursue for long-term advantage.\n\nIt is already a posthumous victory of sorts for Suleimani that the Iraqi parliament has voted to support the expulsion of US troops. Many of Suleimani\u2019s years of political work in Iraq were spent trying to build up pro-Iranian forces, and Iran\u2019s politicians will press the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to quickly enforce parliament\u2019s will. It speaks volumes that he felt compelled to take part in the tributes paid to Suleimani in Baghdad against a backdrop of anti-American slogans.\n\nPlay Video 1:30 Massive crowds attend funeral processions as Suleimani's body is returned to Iran \u2013 video\n\nMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has claimed Iraqis responded to the assassination of Suleimani by dancing in the streets, but the assassination has weakened anti-Iranian forces in Baghdad, including the nationalist protesters in Tahrir Square opposed to Iran and the US using Iraq to fight out their geopolitical battles.\n\nRestraint by Tehran now might strengthen pro-Iranian factions in Iraq as fresh efforts are made to find a new prime minister. A more pro-Iranian mood may also sweep through other capitals in the Middle East as public opinion recoils at Trump\u2019s threats.\n\nIt was notable for instance that Qatari leaders rushed to Tehran to convey their support, even though tens of thousands of US troops are stationed in Qatar. Equally, both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the two Gulf states closest to the US, have issued very cautious remarks about the killing of Suleimani. Saudi Arabia stressed it had not been consulted about the drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nFull-throated support for the US would not only make these countries possible targets for Iran, but also inflame domestic opinion. Lines of communication, often indirect and faltering, have been opening between Iran and Saudi Arabia for months, and while it is too early to talk of a thaw, Tehran now has cards to play with Riyadh that it did not previously possess. There has rarely been a US president less capable of cultivating public opinion in the Middle East. The threat to destroy Iranian cultural sites will leave allies in the region queasy.\n\nIran will also work the court of legal and public opinion over the legality of the drone strike that killed Suleimani. Even Raab did not quite condone Trump\u2019s actions, saying instead that he understood them and condemning Suleimani\u2019s efforts to destabilise the region.\n\nBut Iran is not well suited to the moral high ground. The political mood will demand some form of retribution and response. The fifth and final step announced by Tehran away from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers includes ceasing to recognise any operational restrictions on its civilian nuclear programme. It also means an end to restrictions on centrifuges.\n\nSome will say Tehran\u2019s announcement marks the effective end of the nuclear deal, but by allowing continued independent inspections and not pushing the levels of uranium enrichment to 20%, the continuing European signatories to the agreement can still monitor Tehran\u2019s compliance. As such, it is possible to interpret Iran\u2019s position as wanting to engage with European nations and not put them in the same category as the US.\n\nBut a new gesture by France, Germany and the the UK to keep the deal alive may be required. Tehran has persistently claimed European efforts to increase trade with Iran have been limited.\n\nEmmanuel Macron failed in the autumn at the UN general assembly to bring about a reconciliation between Trump and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. The French president proposed a three-month pause in US sanctions and, in return, a renewed Iranian willingness to renegotiate the nuclear deal as part of a broader settlement.\n\nThe chances of reviving such a complex proposal in the current climate look extremely slim. Indeed, the only force moving in diplomacy\u2019s favour is that the alternative might be an all-out conflict."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/05/cutting-cobalt-challenge-battery-industry-electric-cars-congo", "published": "2020-01-05T12:54:24", "title": "Cutting battery industry's reliance on cobalt will be an uphill task", "text": "Followers of Elon Musk are used to big claims on Twitter.

Benchmark\u2019s forecasts suggest that global demand for cobalt in 2029 will be 300,000 tonnes compared with an estimated 70,000 tonnes used in 2019.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the world\u2019s cobalt supply is sourced from the DRC, a country whose rule of law is among the weakest in the world and which consequently has a terrible record on working conditions and child labour. The majority is then shipped to China, the world\u2019s largest battery manufacturer, to be processed.\n\nThe car industry is by no means the only one implicated: the electronics manufacturers Apple, Google, Dell and Microsoft, as well as Tesla, were named in a US lawsuit last month by families who say their children were killed while mining cobalt used in their products. However, the surge in electric car sales \u2013 as regulations limit exhaust pipe carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 and the kilograms needed in each car mean that cobalt supply concerns will only become more acute.\n\nThere are as many as 150,000 artisanal miners in Kolwezi, the regional capital in southern DRC that has become a major mining centre, according to Mark Dummett, a researcher on business and human rights at Amnesty International. Children working at the mines are easy to find within a five-minute drive of the city centre, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raw cobalt in a factory in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo, before being exported to be refined. Photograph: Samir Tounsi/AFP/Getty\n\nThere has been some progress. The Congolese government has promised to pilot regulated areas for artisanal miners. Increasing consumer awareness has also led to supply chain auditing projects such as the Responsible Sourcing Network, run by the nonprofit organisation As You Sow, as well as two industry-led bodies, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance and Responsible Mining Initiative, to ensure that suppliers are up to standards set by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nCobalt\u2019s human and financial costs, as well as the technological imperative to increase energy density, have prompted research efforts by battery makers to reduce their reliance on the metal.\n\nMost electric vehicle batteries use lithium ions, with nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) in various proportions in the cathode, a key part of any battery. Early batteries contained the three metals in equal proportions, but companies such as South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation and LG Chem are close to producing cathodes with 80% nickel and only 10% cobalt, known as NMC 811. However, chemists have struggled to remove all cobalt, which is prized for stabilising the battery during recharging.\n\nThe FTSE 100 chemicals company Johnson Matthey has been working on reducing the amount of cobalt in its enhanced lithium nickel oxide (eLNO) batteries at one of its research labs in Sonning Common, near Reading. Its batteries, thought to contain higher levels of manganese, could cut cobalt costs in half, according to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\nJohnson Matthey chose Poland for a factory to mass-manufacture the products, opening in 2022, which will eventually produce 10,000 tonnes of battery material a year. BASF and Umicore, rivals from Germany and Belgium, are also working on lower-cobalt chemistries.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel, aged 11, at work in a cobalt mine Photograph: Sebastian Meyer/Corbis via Getty\n\nThe demand for batteries has pulled in investors from unlikely places. The US miner Platinum Group Metals is funding research by Florida International University into using palladium and platinum in battery cathodes and electrolytes, potentially delivering improvements to recharge speeds and stability.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief executive, R Michael Jones, hopes that these technologies \u2013 which are still years away from prototype stage \u2013 will sustain demand for palladium and platinum, which are used for catalytic converters in internal combustion engine cars.\n\nSmaller British companies are also in the race, hoping to emulate the Nobel prize-winning Oxford University researchers who pioneered the lithium ion battery in the 1970s. Oxis Energy, based in the same research centre, is trying to develop lithium sulphur batteries with a claimed five times the energy density of current technology.\n\nYet Caspar Rawles, a senior analyst at Benchmark Minerals, cautions that it will be years before battery manufacturers manage to eliminate cobalt completely. Recent price volatility has limited investment in new capacity, and the two-year shutdown of Glencore\u2019s Mutanda mine near Kolwezi could mean that artisanal miners become a key source of the metal as demand increases.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nTesla\u2019s first Model S, launched in 2012, was built with an average of 11kg of cobalt per vehicle, but according to Benchmark Minerals that was down to about 4.5kg in its successor car, the Model 3, which launched in 2018. That has been achieved using a nickel-cobalt-aluminium chemistry. However, further reductions in line with Musk\u2019s ambitions could be significantly harder. Tesla declined to share more details of its cobalt-reduction plans with the Guardian.\n\nEither way, battery makers have a responsibility to the people of DRC, many thousands of whom rely on cobalt mining for a living, said Amnesty\u2019s Dummett. \u201cIt\u2019s still a relatively new sector, and now is the opportunity to adopt responsible sourcing,\u201d he said."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/the-personal-and-economic-cost-of-kashmirs-internet-ban", "published": "2020-01-05T08:11:55", "title": "\u2018Many lives have been lost\u2019: five-month internet blackout plunges Kashmir into crisis", "text": "Seven million people are still unable to go online after a ban first imposed from Delhi last August\n\nFor many in Kashmir, it has been more than 150 days of agony. The internet blackout which was imposed on the disputed Himalayan region by the Indian government in August is now the longest on record, and has left people\u2019s lives, jobs and the economy in tattered ruins. It has also, according to doctors, cost lives; how many, they say they will never know.\n\nFor Imran Hafeez, a 43-year-old doctor with nearly two decades\u2019 experience as an intervention cardiologist, it has meant watching the devastating demise of his revolutionary and lifesaving initiative, Save Heart Kashmir.\n\nIn Kashmir, where mountainous terrain and archaic road networks mean travel can often take days, patients suffering from cardiac emergencies often don\u2019t have access to specialist doctors or major hospitals in time. But through a volunteer network, 1,200 doctors across the region were connected to each other through four groups on WhatsApp, the instant internet messaging app, where they shared reports of cardio emergencies and sought instant diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIt was the best virtual hospital and doctors were united by WhatsApp. It was a wonderful initiative,\u201d said Hafeez, proudly recounting one of their cases, where a young man in a remote mountainous region was displaying sinking blood pressure and severe chest pain and quickly slipping towards an imminent death. The medic attending to the man posted a message on the group and, several hundreds of miles away, Hafeez instantly recognised that the man was having a heart attack.\n\n\u201cHit him quickly,\u201d Hafeez wrote to Sheen, the medic who had sent the patient\u2019s ECG from remote Ladakh. \u201cGet two IV access. Start Thrombolysis. And another (IV) give 20ml Bolus NS. Don\u2019t waste time.\u201d Ninety minutes later, the young man was stable and conscious.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shut-down shops in Srinagar demonstrate the toll the internet ban has taken on the local economy. Photograph: Danish Ismail/Reuters\n\nOver the 500 days it was running, the group operated round the clock and analysed 38,700 ECGs, handled 19,395 cases and administered thrombolysis 778 times to clear blocked veins. That was until 5 August, when an indefinite internet suspension was imposed upon the region and, five months on, shows no sign of being lifted.\n\n\u201cAll is gone \u2026 this is so depressing,\u201d said Hafeez. \u201cWe definitely saved lives and it was going very well until everything broke down. I don\u2019t know how many patients we have lost, but patient care has definitely suffered.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the Indian government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, to revoke Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s constitutional autonomy and split it into two territories under the control of the federal government \u2013 bringing an end to seven decades of semi-autonomous rule \u2013 was followed by a series of militaristic measures.\n\nTens of thousands of troops moved in, former chief ministers, legislators and separatist leaders were detained, curfews and travel restriction were imposed and all communication methods, including phone access to the internet, was cut off. While the crackdown has eased, many restrictions remain and seven million people in Kashmir are without the internet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kashmiri students queue up to use internet facilities at the divisional commissioner\u2019s office in Srinagar. Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe administration, which has suspended internet services by invoking sections of the British colonial era Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, defended the blackout by arguing that \u201cprovocative and instigating material was posted from the internet connections and Twitter handles and other social media sites\u201d.\n\nIt is now the longest internet shutdown ever imposed in a democracy. It is also becoming what civil society groups and freedom of expression activists have called a \u201cworrying trend\u201d by the BJP government, where, at the first sign of unrest, they block the internet almost instantly, as has been seen recently when a wave of protests swept across India opposing a new citizenship bill seen as discriminatory to Muslims. In the past month, shutdowns were imposed in areas of Assam, across the whole of India\u2019s most populous state Uttar Pradesh, and, for the first time, in the capital, Delhi.\n\nIndeed, India now holds the inglorious title of being the internet shutdown capital of the world, and last year it shut off the internet a record 106 times. It is not only damaging to freedom of expression but an economically costly tool of repression: Indian mobile operators lose about 24.5 million rupees (\u00a3270,000) in revenue every hour they are forced to suspend internet services.\n\nWe had no contact with our families and even our families had no information if we are alive or not\n\n\u201cAccording to law, an internet shutdown can only be imposed is if there\u2019s a public safety precaution or a public emergency, but unfortunately these two words are not defined in any legislation of India,\u201d said Sundar Krishnan, executive director of SFLC.in, an advocacy group that has tracked internet shutdowns in India since 2012.\n\n\u201cEvery time the government feels there will be civil unrest, rather than dealing with it through democratic means or addressing the root causes, they shut down the internet because it\u2019s the easiest thing to do. It\u2019s been three days into 2020 and we already have two internet shutdowns.\u201d\n\nJhalani also pointed out that several recent studies found that it is a myth that internet shutdowns curb unrest; instead they often contribute to a rise in turmoil.\n\nThe impact of the shutdown in Kashmir has proved calamitous to the economy, crushing innovation in the region and leading to a mass exodus of young people in search of new jobs. Each morning, hundreds squeeze on to the train that travels out of Kashmir\u2019s capital, Srinagar, locally dubbed the \u201cinternet express\u201d, desperately getting out of the region to carry out basic admin, register for law and medical entrance exams, contact family and find new employment miles away from home.\n\nShayan Nabi was once the proud owner of a small start-up company, Harmukh Technologies. The company, which ran online advertisement campaigns for domestic and foreign clients was among the many casualties of the blockade as business was impossible without internet access.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing to be jobless. I want to go home, but then what will I tell my family?\u201d Nabi, 30, asked as he searched for future options in New Delhi, 500 miles away, joining a wave of disenfranchised Kashmiri youths forced to leave their homes over the past five months.\n\n\u201cI left a bank job for this, I dropped out of MBA for this, because I wanted to do something of my own,\u2019\u2019 said Nabi. \u201cBut more than being angry I feel helplessness: what can I be angry about and against whom?\u201d\n\nIndia's internet curbs are part of growing global trend Read more\n\nThe toll has not only been economic. A software programmer working in a Srinagar-based tech company, which had relocated for several months to the southern Indian city of Bangalore after its internet lifeline was snapped, described the experience as an \u201cemotional hell\u201d. \u201cWe had no contact with our families and even our families had no information if we are alive or not,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is unclear when the Indian government intends to allow full internet access in the region. Some IT companies have been given access but under stringent restrictions, including complete government monitoring of their activity and a ban on social media sites. This week, SMS services were restored, and 80 government hospitals were given access, although there are more than 1,000 private hospitals and medical facilities still unable to connect to the internet, which doctors say has severely affected treatment and access to medicines for patients.\n\nSheikh Ashiq, president of the eight-decade-old Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the losses incurred by the region due to the internet shutdown are estimated to be well over \u00a31bn. \u201cLet me explain this: tourism is entirely dependent on internet and who will come to a place without internet for leisure tourism?\u201d said Ashiq, who said thousands of artisans and weavers had been left without work as connections with their foreign clients had been severed and they could no longer sell their products online.\n\nAshiq described the current situation as \u201cagony\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s affected us badly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe live in a world with an internet-based economy and we live in a place where there\u2019s no internet. While people all over world over wished each other happy new year, we couldn\u2019t even send a simple text to anyone.\u201d\n\nFor safety reasons, the Observer is not naming its reporter"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/after-the-fall-can-alexander-zverev-bounce-back-to-tennis-stardom", "published": "2020-01-05T08:00:55", "title": "After the fall: can Alexander Zverev bounce back to tennis stardom?", "text": "He had it all: talent, good looks and a chance to be the world No 1. But then Alexander Zverev\u2019s life went to pieces\u2026\n\nThe tennis player Alexander Zverev has blue eyes and shaggy blond hair and is 6ft 7in tall. His legs are stilts, and his face, journalists have pointed out, is that of an Abercrombie & Fitch model. Zverev actually has a modelling contract with Zegna, the Italian fashion brand, partly because he is a well-known tennis player, but also because he looks less like a tennis player and more like a luxury clothes horse.\n\nZverev is 22. He joined the pro circuit in 2013, when he was 16. At the end of 2018, he was ranked the fourth best men\u2019s tennis player in the world, behind Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer \u2013 the big three \u2013 but ahead of younger challengers. He\u2019d recently won the ATP Finals, in London, the so-called fifth grand slam, becoming the youngest player to win the tournament in a decade. As a kid he\u2019d been the world junior No 1 and a junior grand slam champion. For years, fans had thought of him as tennis\u2019s crown prince \u2013 the prodigal heir. Both Nadal and Djokovic had hinted at Zverev becoming their eventual successor. Here, finally, after the failed attempts of other once up-and-coming players, was a talent poised to dethrone the game\u2019s elder greats. At the end of one 2018 tournament, Boris Becker announced: \u201cA star has arrived.\u201d\n\nFor a while, life was good. Life was trouble-free! Zverev would appear at tournaments, project supreme self-confidence, absorb any and all stress (\u201cPressure is a privilege,\u201d he says, in that throwaway, sportsperson way), and rain down hard, flat serves at 140mph.\n\nAnd then, just like that, the narrative flipped.\n\nIn January last year, Zverev broke up with his agent, Patricio Apey, a former player, with whom Zverev had worked since he was 15. (What began as a tiff evolved into a protracted legal battle, which is ongoing, even now.) Then, in short order, he separated from his girlfriend, the Russian player Olya Sharypova; his father, himself a former pro, as well as Zverev\u2019s long-time coach, fell ill and returned home to Germany, where Zverev grew up; and he endured a strange period in which Ivan Lendl was technically hired as his coach, but often failed to turn up to his games. For a while last year, Zverev didn\u2019t have a coach. Pro tennis players often arrive at tournaments with an almighty entourage. At two competitions in 2019, Zverev appeared alone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Net call: losing to Novak Djokovic at the 2019 French Open. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nDuring the first half of the 2019 season, Zverev\u2019s performances teetered, then collapsed over the edge. He lost in the second round at Indian Wells, in March. He lost at a competition in Miami (first round, same month), against a player ranked 155 in the world. And then in Marrakech (second round), Monte Carlo (second round), Barcelona (first round), Rome (first round) and Stuttgart (first round). Zverev had been tipped to win competitions, not spill out of opening rounds. But what had once seemed so easy \u2013 the winning \u2013 all of a sudden became very hard. You couldn\u2019t call it a slump, really. In six months, he barely won.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to imagine Zverev suffering a kind of crisis. His self-belief wavered. He became dejected and impetuous and difficult to be around. At Wimbledon, last July, he lost in the first round to the Czech qualifier Jiri Vesely (wily journeyman, rank 124). After the game, Zverev slunk into a press conference. His hair was roughly tousled and his blue eyes dulled \u2013 a surly, sorry wreck. \u201cI\u2019m not very high on confidence right now,\u201d he said, and then, for emphasis: \u201cMy confidence is below zero.\u201d When a reporter asked why, Zverev replied: \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t won much this year,\u201d and looked away in disgust. But then he elaborated a little. \u201cI get down on myself a lot,\u201d he said, before alluding to personal problems. When he later mentioned he might need a break from the game, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear if he meant a holiday, or if he planned to walk away from tennis and never come back.\n\nI meet Zverev in a busy hotel restaurant in central London. It\u2019s a Tuesday in November, mid-morning. He has arrived in head-to-toe tracksuit, shaggy hair, wiry, not powerfully built, tall enough for people to make a big deal of his height. Around us, staff are clearing away breakfast things. We are here specifically to talk about his year. The horrible professional descent. How something like that even happens.\n\nI suggest he\u2019s had a rough time. Later he\u2019ll call it \u201ca grind\u201d, but for now he just nods. \u201cI had a stretch where I was probably one of the best players in the world,\u201d he begins. \u201cI really felt like I was the best player in the world\u2026 and then, all of a sudden, I don\u2019t have a manager. Everything a manager has to do, I had to do myself.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There\u2019s nobody in the world that puts more pressure on myself than me\u2019: Alex Zverev. Photograph: Perou/The Observer\n\nHe says this in the most straightforward way \u2013 a kind of it is what it is \u2013 and then he describes, plainly and rationally, a months-long period during which he performed several different jobs all at once: the job of being a player, and a manager, and a coach, and an assistant, and a second assistant, booking hotel rooms, thrashing out contracts, playing at tournaments, registering for new tournaments, liaising with lawyers, liaising with tour officials, practising, calling in gear. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody to do the little things,\u201d he says. Like respond to emails. So many emails! \u201cYou know, doing that every week, it\u2019s not easy, concentration-wise.\u201d\n\nThese days, an athlete\u2019s life is managed almost entirely by other people. Players don\u2019t tend to negotiate deals, or sweet-talk sponsors, or book flights \u2013 managers do. It\u2019s a strange and necessary kind of privilege: employ people to manage your affairs so you can focus on managing your performance levels. You can\u2019t be your own manager and your own assistant and still be a top-10 professional tennis player.\n\nThe fun left me. Not only in tennis. For quite a while I was not myself\n\nIn 2018, as it had been since he was young, everything had been taken care of for him. \u201cAll I had to do was wake up, practise, do my gym sessions, and go back to bed,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it made life very easy, you know? You don\u2019t have to think about anything apart from the sport you really love, the sport that since you were a little kid you\u2019ve always wanted to do\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou know, tennis is a tough sport physically and mentally. Mentally it\u2019s draining. You have to focus. It\u2019s a one-on-one sport. You can\u2019t think about anything else. And all of a sudden, before and after matches, I have to do all these different things?\u201d Emails. Contracts. Phone calls. The lawyers. \u201cYou go on court and your mind\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nHe recalls spending eight hours in a legal meeting the day before his opening game at a tournament in Rome (first-round loss). His lawyers had flown in last-minute. Surprise! \u201cI have no idea of the language they\u2019re speaking\u201d \u2013 the legalese \u2013 \u201cbecause it\u2019s different.\u201d The following day was a write-off; lingering stress seeped into his game like water into cracks. \u201cI was on the court and I was just absolutely\u2026\u201d He\u2019d barely said one word to a lawyer before 2018. \u201cI had no energy. Nothing inside myself.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I didn\u2019t have anybody to do the little things\u2019: with former coach Ivan Lendl. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nZverev was known on tour for a brutal competitive streak and extreme self-confidence, but suddenly he thought: maybe I\u2019m just not as good as these other guys. \u201cYou know, most of the time I was in a bad mood when I was on the tennis court,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fun left me. Not only in tennis, but in everything I was doing. For quite a while I was not myself.\u201d He became angry and irritable. \u201cI\u2019m more tired,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019m not into it as much.\u201d He\u2019d arrive at practice and think, \u201cI kind of don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d\n\nDuring a first-round game at a tournament in Cincinnati, in August last year, he served 20 double faults \u2013 rock bottom for a pro. He would reach the baseline, toss the ball, and lose focus. \u201cI didn\u2019t all of a sudden forget how to serve,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just, things play on your mind. And at that moment\u2026\u201d He pauses, then reframes. \u201cI was always a person who loved the tough moments. That\u2019s where the tennis gets interesting. That\u2019s what you play for. But this year? I really, really struggled in those kinds of situations.\u201d\n\nHe thought about taking that break. Maybe he could end the season early and start fresh in the new year. But, no. \u201cI wanted to improve,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to go further up the rankings.\u201d A big slump. \u201cAnd I went backwards.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: the real reason we\u2019re meeting now is because \u2013 guess what? \u2013 Alexander Zverev is somehow, miraculously, against all odds, back on track! In October, he reached the final of the Shanghai Masters and the semi-final of the China Open, in Beijing \u2013 top-tier events. He\u2019s in London to defend his title at the ATP Finals \u2013 where he will thrash Rafael Nadal, but lose in the semi-finals, to Dominic Thiem \u2013 to which only the best eight players on the men\u2019s tour get invited. (Zverev finished the season, thanks to his late surge, ranked 7 in the world.) By the time this conversation is published, he will have toured south America with Roger Federer, played his part in breaking the record for the largest crowd attendance at a tennis match (42,217, at a stadium in Mexico City), gently consoled Federer after one of their exhibition matches almost evolved into a riot, loosened up during the off-season break, represented Germany at the ATP Cup (first match: a loss in which Zverev, perhaps not all the way back, served several double faults, angrily smashed a racket against the floor, and was later described by one newspaper as a \u201ctennis hothead\u201d) and returned to the tour ready for the Australian Open, later this month.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You know, in my mind, I\u2019m not that young any more, and I need to start improving\u2019: Alexander Zverev has his eye focused on tennis\u2019s No 1 spot. Photograph: Perou/The Observer\n\nHe has had time to reflect on all of this, too: the strange, unexpected upturn in form. He has taken his whole season apart and analysed it piece by piece. And what he has come to understand is this: all he ever needed to do was \u2013 his words \u2013 \u201cLet go.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right, in a way, about the letting go. After Wimbledon he did take a break \u2013 a short holiday. And then he announced, to himself more than anyone else, that if he continued to play so poorly he\u2019d finish his season early and go again in 2020. \u201cThat loosened me up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me not think about anything.\u201d He relaxed into the routines he developed early in his career, when he arrived at tournaments hopeful, but not expecting to win.\n\nOther people my age are finishing college and trying to find a job\n\n\u201cI was just, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to enjoy playing the best players in the world, enjoy being out here, hopefully give myself the best chances to win matches.\u2019\u201d The pressure lifted. \u201cThe thing is, there\u2019s nobody in the world that puts more pressure on myself than me.\u201d And he grew up, maybe, though: \u201cIt\u2019s never nice to say about yourself that you\u2019ve grown up.\u201d\n\nBut letting go isn\u2019t the full story. In August, Zverev signed papers with a new management company, Team8, a firm established by Roger Federer. (Zverev did not organise this interview, his new publicist did.) His father recovered and returned to the tour \u2013 a calming presence. And he began dating the German supermodel Brenda Patea, who now appears in Zverev\u2019s Instagram feed \u2013 modern love \u2013 and who is as leggy and good-looking as he is. Slowly, a kind of stability returned. Whatever personal and professional foundations crumbled at the beginning of last year \u2013 no management, no support staff, no partner \u2013 Zverev has painstakingly rebuilt, brick by brick.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s never nice to say about yourself that you\u2019ve grown up\u2019: as a teenager with his family.

Despised by the authority he or she betrays, the revealer of hidden corporate or governmental truths is seldom embraced as a hero by society at large.\n\nIt\u2019s true that film-makers are drawn to whistleblowers because their struggle \u2013 the little guy up against the establishment \u2013 can make for compelling drama: two fine examples being Michael Mann\u2019s The Insider (starring Russell Crowe) and Gavin Hood\u2019s recent Official Secrets (starring fictionalised versions of several of this newspaper\u2019s journalists).\n\nBut the chances are, most people who have seen those films won\u2019t remember the names of the whistleblowers they depict: respectively Jeffrey Wigand and Katharine Gun. Even after they\u2019ve gone public, whistleblowers tend to remain shadowy figures, cut off from the industries or positions that brought them to prominence, but with no new role to match the notoriety/celebrity briefly visited upon them.\n\nAnother reason for their marginal presence is suggested in Tom Mueller\u2019s expansive study of the subject, Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud. \u201cMany people who blow the whistle are able to do so precisely because they are not like most of us, or how we\u2019re told to be,\u201d writes Mueller. \u201cThey\u2019re not \u2018team players\u2019, not \u2018go along to get along\u2019 personalities. They can be prickly and doctrinaire. They can seem obsessive, even unstable.\u201d\n\nReading this book, you get the strong sense that if the characters involved didn\u2019t start out that way, then they had every reason to develop in that direction. To go against the crowd and the prevailing ethos requires a certain independence of spirit, but to withstand the opprobrium, threats, financial ruin and sometimes imprisonment likely to come your way demands a psychological resilience that is bestowed on very few people who, as it were, look normal on television.\n\nOne obvious exception is Daniel Ellsberg, arguably the most famous America whistleblower of the 20th century (and Mueller\u2019s focus is resolutely on the US), who also turns up in these pages. Photogenic and with a PhD from Harvard, Ellsberg exposed the US government\u2019s lies and deception over the Vietnam war when he handed classified documents to the New York Times. For disclosing the so-called Pentagon Papers he faced a 115-year jail sentence, but was found not guilty after a bizarre trial in which it was revealed that Watergate conspirators had broken into Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist\u2019s office to steal Ellsberg\u2019s file.\n\nEllsberg remains the go-to guy for the media whenever a major act of whistleblowing hits the headlines, like Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the practices of the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US. Predictably, Snowden and Chelsea Manning are both referenced here in a wide-ranging analysis of intelligence whistleblowers.\n\nIraq war whistleblower Katharine Gun: \u2018Truth always matters\u2019 Read more\n\nMueller points a critical finger at President Obama, who, he notes, had promised to protect whistleblowers when running for office but once in the White House \u201ccondemned national security whistleblowers more harshly than any other president in history\u201d.\n\nObama drew, or at least attempted to draw, a distinction between whistleblowers and traitors, but if that\u2019s a clear line, it\u2019s one that different people place in different positions, usually depending on their own relationship to power.\n\nMueller is a little surprised to find that corporate and governmental whistleblowers have more in common than he first assumed. At their core all are concerned with an ethical crisis of some kind and the binding group mentality against which they turn. Perhaps the most troubling stories in the book are those that operate between the two gravitational fields of big business and government.\n\nTake the case of Allen Jones, an investigator at the Office of the Inspector General in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. One day he discovered that a cheque for $2,000 had been placed in an unregistered bank account of the state\u2019s chief pharmacist. In the grand scheme of things, it was a tiny figure, but on closer inspection it turned out to be \u201ca loose pebble that started an avalanche\u201d.\n\nThrough diligently following the money, Jones discovered that a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson had persuaded the states of Pennsylvania and Texas to require all doctors at state facilities to use \u201catypical antipsychotics\u201d for a variety of conditions, which cost up to 45 times more than the drugs they replaced, though they produced no better results and had more disturbing side-effects.\n\nFor his trouble, Jones was ordered by the office of the Republican governor of Pennsylvania to stop his investigations and, when he didn\u2019t, he was moved away and, after going public, drummed out of his job. He sued his employers and those responsible but the defendants were granted immunity, he lost his house and had to settle for such a negligible amount that, after paying his creditors, he was left with just $1,200.\n\nNo one likes a snitch, they say in criminal circles. If there\u2019s one thing beyond all others that Mueller conveys to the reader, it\u2019s that those circles are a lot bigger than you might think.\n\n\u2022 Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud by Tom Mueller is published by Atlantic (\u00a314.99).

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questioned if President Donald Trump\u2019s reasons for the Qasem Soleimani assassination was to distract from impeachment.\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think that the question that we ought to focus on is why now? Why not a month ago, and why not a month from now? And the answer from the administration seems to be that they can\u2019t keep their story straight on this. They pointed in all different directions. And you know, the last time that we watched them do this was the summer over Ukraine. As soon as people started asking about the conversations between Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine and why aid had been held up to Ukraine, the administration did the same thing. They pointed in all directions of what was going on. And of course, what emerged then is that this is Donald Trump just trying to advance Donald Trump\u2019s own political agenda. Not the agenda of the United States of America. So what happens right now? Next week, the president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he is deeply upset about that. I think that people are reasonably asking why this moment? Why does he pick now to take this highly inflammatory, highly dangerous action that moves us closer to war? We have been at war for 20 years in the Middle East, and we need to stop the war this the Middle East and not expand it.\u201d\n\nTapper asked, \u201cAre you suggesting that President Trump pulled the trigger and had Qasem Soleimani killed as a distraction from impeachment?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cLook, I think that people are reasonably asking about the timing and why it is that the administration seems to have all kinds of different answers. In the first 48 hours after this attack, what did we hear? Well, we heard it was for an imminent attack, and then we heard, no, no, it is to prevent any future attack, and then we heard that it is from the vice president himself and no, it is related to 9/11, and then we heard from president reports of people in the intelligence community saying that the whole, that the threat was overblown. You know, when the administration doesn\u2019t seem to have a coherent answer for taking a step like this. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, a step that puts everyone at risk, and step that puts the military at risk and puts the diplomats in the region at risk. And we have already paid a huge price for this war. Thousands of American lives lost, and a cost that we have paid domestically and around the world. At the same time, look at what it has done in the Middle East, millions of people who have been killed, who have been injured, who have been displaced. So this is not a moment when the president should be escalating tensions and moving us to war. The job of the president is to keep us safe, and that means move back from the edge.\u201d\n\nTapper pressed, \u201cDo you believe that President Trump pulled the trigger on this operation as a way to distract from impeachment? Is that what you think?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think it is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration immediately after having taken this decision offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what is going on.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it is the right question to ask. We will get more information as we go forward but look at the timing on this. Look at what Donald Trump has said afterward and his administration. They have pointed in multiple directions. There is a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago and not a month from now, not a less aggressive and less dangerous response. He had a whole range of responses that were presented to him. He didn\u2019t pick one of the other ones. He picked the most aggressive and the one that moves us closer to war. So what does everybody talk about today? Are we going to war? Are we going to have another five years, tens, ten years of war in the Middle East, and dragged in once again. Are we bringing another generation of young people into war? That is every bit of the conversation right now. Donald Trump has taken an extraordinarily reckless step, and we have seen it before, he is using foreign policy and uses whatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/warren-questions-if-soleimani-strike-linked-to-impeachment-look-at-the-timing/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "U.S. Service Member, Two Contractors Killed in Kenya Jihadist Attack", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A jihadist attack on a military base in Kenya killed three people Sunday, including a US service member and two civilian defense contractors, the American military said.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of our teammates who lost their lives today,\u201d General Stephen Townsend, the head of US Africa Command (Africom), said after jihadists from Somalia\u2019s Al-Shabaab group stormed a base in the Lamu region.\n\nTwo other Department of Defense personnel were wounded in the attack on Camp Simba, Africom added in a statement which gave no details on the identity of those killed.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/01/05/u-s-service-member-two-defense-contractors-killed-in-kenya-jihadist-attack/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Golden Globes Host Ricky Gervais: Hollywood in No Position to Lecture About Anything.

In 2018, less than 3.8 million babies were born in the U.S. \u2014 a drop of two percent, or almost 64,000 births, since 2017.\n\nThe total fertility rate, which stands at 1,729.5 births per 1,000 women, remains below replacement level \u2014 the number of births needed to at least replace a generation of Americans.

The Vera Institute of Justice (a liberal group dedicated to eliminating cash bail) explained (emphasis added):\n\nNew York was, and remains, the only state in the country that precludes judges from taking into account any consider- ation of public safety when setting bail or imposing pretrial detention. Until the 1970s, all bail statutes only considered failure to appear. With the advent of \u201ctough on crime\u201d rhetoric and policies, several states began to amend their bail laws to in- clude a consideration of risk to public safety. In 1984, Congress passed the Federal Bail Reform Act, which introduced public safety in the federal bail system and survived a constitutional challenge in United States v. Salerno.7 Since then, 49 states, all except New York, have changed their bail laws to allow judges to consider both risk of failure to appear and public safety in pretrial decisions.\n\nNew York\u2019s Bail Elimination Act exacerbated the prior risks in New York. The Vera institute calls New York\u2019s new provisions \u201ctransformative\u201d because it reduces the traditional discretion of the courts.\n\nThese \u201ctransformative\u201d new provisions include:\n\n(1) Mandating that the police must simply issue an appearance ticket (a summons) to most people charged with misdemeanors and Class E felonies, some of which are violent felonies.\n\n(2) Mandating release for a wide swath of offenses, and requiring judges to jump through hoops to impose restrictions on defendants. New CPL [Criminal Procedure Law] \u00a7 500.10.1 provides that (emphasis added): \u201cIn all such cases [where a future court appearance may be required], except where another type of securing order is shown to be required by law, the court shall release the principal [arrested person] pending trial on the principal\u2019s own recognizance, unless it is demonstrated and the court makes an individualized determination that the principal poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution. If such a finding is made, the court must select the least restrictive alternative and condition or conditions that will reasonably assure the principal\u2019s return to court. The court shall explain its choice of release, release with conditions, bail or remand on the record or in writing.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s mandated release is unusually lenient. Every other state\u2019s bail reform law merely require courts to consider a \u201cpresumption\u201d of release for most offenses.\n\n(3) As noted above when a condition on release is imposed, the judge is required to impose the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions on release that will \u201creasonably assure\u201d the arrested person\u2019s return to court. Further, the use of electronic monitoring is extremely limited. (See CPL \u00a7 500.10.3-a)\n\nImposing the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions that \u201creasonably assure\u201d a return to court is far less protective of the public than the previous standard. New York law previously provided that \u201cthe court must consider the kind and degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure his [the defendant\u2019s] court attendance.\u201d (Prior CPL \u00a7 510.30.2(a).)\n\nIn all likelihood, fewer defendants will show up at their court hearings under the new standard, which does not impose conditions \u201cnecessary\u201d to secure court attendance.\n\n(4) Requiring judges to consider a person\u2019s \u201cability to post bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his or her ability to obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond.\u201d (CPL \u00a7 510.30.) When bail is imposed, judges are also required to set at least three or more forms of bail, one of which must be an unsecured or partially secured bond. An \u201cunsecured bond\u201d only requires payment if and when someone fails to show up for court, and offers far less incentive to return to court than paying bail prior to the court date does.\n\nThe previous version of CPL \u00a7 510.30 already required courts to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cemployment and financial resources.\u201d The law thus already addressed the \u201cbail system favors the rich\u201d argument.\n\nThe new \u201cability to pay without undue hardship\u201d requirement invites manipulation of the system.\n\n(5) When a defendant fails to appear for his court date, the new law now requires judges to give defendants a 48-hour grace period to voluntarily appear prior to issuing a bench warrant. (CPL \u00a7 510.50) This potentially leaves defendants who pose a risk to the public in the community even longer.\n\nWhat are the solutions?\n\nFirst, New York needs to reconsider its refusal to consider danger to the public when making bail determinations.\n\nProperly crafted laws can take danger to the community into account in bail and bail denial determinations. In United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld taking into account in bail determinations the arrestee\u2019s dangerousness, for specific serious offenses where Congress found that arrestees were likely to repeat the offense if released, where the arrestees were provided with due process protections, including probable cause, and a full-blown adversary hearing.\n\nSecond, at a minimum, New York should amend its Bail Elimination Act so that the courts are not required to give mandatory desk tickets and mandatory release to the perpetrators of hate crimes. New York\u2019s new \u201ccapture and release\u201d system fails to take the plague of antisemitic hate crimes seriously.\n\nThird, we need to return to a system that sets bail at an amount \u201cnecessary to secure\u201d defendants\u2019 return to court. The victims and potential future victims of antisemitic hate crimes deserve no less.\n\nIf the New York State legislature is sincere about stopping the antisemitic crime wave plague on New York\u2019s streets, the legislature must immediately fix this new flawed system.\n\nMorton A Klein is president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA.

U.S. District Court of Appeals that would allow for the effort by congressional Democratic.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCongressman, thanks for staying with us. Now, I want to talk about \u2014 and I\u2019d love to stay with Iran, but I don\u2019t have that much time.\n\nI want to talk to you about impeachment. So Pelosi impeaches the President, so to speak. I\u2019m not quite sure if she did or didn\u2019t because it\u2019s still in the House, and it hasn\u2019t been transferred to the Senate.\n\nSo they were in a rush these Democrats. We\u2019re going to get it done by the end of the year. We\u2019re going to get it done by Christmas. They get it done by Christmas, and they\u2019re slow to give it over to the Senate. What is going on? Do you know?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I think Nancy Pelosi thinks she has more power than she does. Once she names the managers, it will go to the Senate.\n\nBut an interesting thing happened just yesterday in the U.S. District Court of Appeals inside D.C. Pelosi\u2019s House Attorney, Douglas Letter made the argument before a judge that they could offer another Article of Impeachment.\n\nThis is the only thing the Democrats\u2019 agenda is to try to impeach this President. Al Green has said it. You\u2019ve heard it from so many other Democrats. It is their only goal of what they\u2019re continuing to try to do. Their case is so weak.\n\nI think part of the Speaker\u2019s problem is she doesn\u2019t want to show it over to the Senate, because bipartisan they\u2019ll vote against it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPIRRO: Wait, wait, OK \u2014 you\u2019ve got to stop there. She wants to add another Article to the two Articles of Impeachment that we don\u2019t even know if our Articles of Impeachment because they\u2019re just in limbo right now, without a vote? She wants to add another, that\u2019s like me \u2014\n\nMCCARTHY: That is an argument. That is what hurt \u2014\n\nPIRRO: Go ahead.\n\nMCCARTHY: \u2014 her attorney made that argument in a Court of Appeals in D.C. yesterday before a judge when the judge questioned why are they even asking for this? It dealt with the Mueller Report because impeachment is over.\n\nAnd he says, could there be another impeachment? He said, yes. Nancy Pelosi has signed off on that. We could go to a third Article of Impeachment. They have nothing else on their agenda.\n\nWhile this President is taking terrorists out and making America safer. They\u2019re trying to take the President out. They will not put America first by far.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPIRRO: This is outrageous. This is outrageous. OK, all right. Let\u2019s follow this through, OK? Because this is infuriating. And it\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of it. I don\u2019t think anybody said this so far.\n\nSo here you\u2019ve got this woman in a rush to get impeachment. They get it done by the end of the year. Now the thing is in limbo. She goes to a court that\u2019s like me indicting someone for petty larceny, and then saying, hey \u2014 after the grand jury voted \u2014 I\u2019m going to indict him for murder, too, judge, let\u2019s just throw that in there. What the heck? We don\u2019t need an indictment (ph) \u2014 we don\u2019t need to vote on it.\n\nBut the more important is the fact that right now, she says that she doesn\u2019t want to send it over until she is sure it\u2019s going to be fair in the Senate. I\u2019ll tell you what I would do. I would tell Mitch McConnell that he ought to automatically dismiss it. There\u2019s got to be a default. There\u2019s got to be \u2014 if you\u2019re entitled to a speedy trial, if you\u2019re entitled to be able to \u2014 if there\u2019s a statute of limitations, it\u2019s passed.\n\nThis thing, there should be a default judgment, overdone for non- prosecution. What is McConnell waiting for?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I think what McConnell is looking and seeing, and you\u2019ve (ph) talked to all the senators over there. Here, they\u2019re going back in session. We will be back in session next week. That is when Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, should name the managers and send it over.\n\nShe does not have a right to dictate what the Senate will do, just as the Senate didn\u2019t have a right to dictate to the House.\n\nIn the House, she did not allow the minority to offer any witnesses. She did not give this President any procedures that we had given to Clinton and to Nixon. She changed the whole dynamic of where to go. And she forced us through the thinnest, the weakest and the fastest impeachment in the history.\n\nShe said it had to be bipartisan. And the only bipartisan vote was against impeachment.\n\nShe knows this is weak. She is showing her hand that it is weak, and when it goes into Senate, it will fail.\n\nPIRRO: But this is crazy. Well, but why can\u2019t the Senate dismiss it out of hand right now? If Article 1 Section 2 says the House impeaches, Article 1 Section 3 says that the Senate does the actual trial. You know what? I make a motion to dismiss. I make a motion to dismiss for non-prosecution, for failure to have a speedy trial, denial of my rights, all of that don\u2019t even go along with this game. This is a charade. It\u2019s a shell game.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be upset with you. I am upset with Mitch McConnell.\n\nMCCARTHY: It shows very clearly that it\u2019s a shell game. If 51 senators \u2014\n\nPIRRO: Yes.\n\nMCCARTHY: I hear you completely. And I think America is upset.\n\nPIRRO: He is never coming on my show by the way now.\n\nMCCARTHY: And you should be upset with Mitch McConnell. You should be upset \u2014 you should be very upset with Nancy Pelosi. Listen to what Schumer is asking. Schumer is now asking for witnesses when they would not even allow the minority to have witnesses.\n\nThey want to have Bolton. The Democrats could pull whoever they wanted. They never subpoenaed Bolton. But now they know their case is so weak. This is outrageous to the whole American public.\n\nHere we are with so many other problems before us. We know this is going to fail in the Senate. If 51 senators got together based upon what Nancy Pelosi has done here, they could dismiss this. And I believe if \u2014\n\nPIRRO: Yes.\n\nMCCARTHY: \u2014 Nancy Pelosi does not move with the managers in the next week, then I think you\u2019ll see a movement within the Senate to do just that.\n\nPIRRO: Well, I hope so. It should be done. It should have been done on January 1st. But what she is doing is she is holding her finger to the wind, hoping that something will increase the chances of impeachment to get a few extra senators in the Senate so that she can win.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/mccarthy-pelosi-third-article-impeachment/", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Republican Jeanne Ives: Sean Casten a 'Symbol' of the Radical Left", "text": "Former Illinois state representative and sixth congressional district Republican candidate Jeanne Ives told Breitbart News Saturday that Rep.

Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cMarriage Story\u201d leads all movies with six nods, including best film, drama. Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d with five nominations, is up for the same category. The box-office smash \u201cJoker\u201d may be their stiffest competition.\n\nThe path is more certain for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\u201d which is competing in the comedy or musical category. It could easily take home more trophies than any other movie, with possible wins for Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio \u2014 a 12-time Globes nominee and three-time winner \u2014 and Tarantino\u2019s script. Tarantino is also up for best director, though he faces formidable competition in Scorsese and \u201cParasite\u201d filmmaker Bong Joon Ho.\n\nThe dearth of nominations for female filmmakers has stoked more backlash than anything else at this year\u2019s Globes. Only men were nominated for best director (just five women have ever been nominated in the category), and none of the 10 films up for best picture was directed by a woman, either.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/01/05/ricky-gervais-to-j-lo-what-to-expect-at-the-golden-globes/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Rose McGowan Doubles Down After Apologizing to Iran over Soleimani Airstrike: \u2018I Want America to Be Better\u2019", "text": "Actress Rose McGowan defended her tweet in which she apologized on behalf of the U.S. to Iran for \u201cdisrespecting their flag and people\u201d after a U.S. military airstrike killed Gen.

As the salutary example of South Australia\u2019s Great Green Energy Disaster suggests, these outages are likely to become the new normal.\n\nThe obvious solution to Britain\u2019s energy problems \u2014 highlighted by the oil price spike caused by the Soleimani assassination \u2014 is to frack the rich seams of shale all over the country and experience a taste of America\u2019s energy independence.\n\nUnfortunately, Johnson\u2019s administration has more or less caved to the environmentalists on shale gas; and Boris has furthermore committed himself to the on-the-hoof, well-poisoning Net Zero by 2050 policy dreamed up in the dog days of his disastrous predecessor Theresa May.\n\nSomething will have to give, at some stage.\n\nDelingpole: Britain Signs \u00a31 Trillion \u2018Net Zero\u2019 Carbon Suicide Note https://t.co/je8iVLLILo \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 25, 2019\n\nBritain will eventually have to choose between the expensive green virtue-signalling urged, inter alia, by Michael Gove, discredited former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and Telegraph house eco-loon financial writers Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner.\n\nOr keeping the lights on and stopping people \u2014 the working classes who voted Tory at the last election, for example \u2014 being driven into energy poverty.\n\nGosh, it\u2019s going to be a toughie.

Why not a month ago, and why not a month from now? And the answer from the administration seems to be that they can\u2019t keep their story straight on this. They pointed in all different directions.

As soon as people started asking about the conversations between Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine and why aid had been held up to Ukraine, the administration did the same thing. They pointed in all directions of what was going on. And of course, what emerged then is that this is Donald Trump just trying to advance Donald Trump\u2019s own political agenda. Not the agenda of the United States of America. So what happens right now? Next week, the president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he is deeply upset about that. I think that people are reasonably asking why this moment? Why does he pick now to take this highly inflammatory, highly dangerous action that moves us closer to war? We have been at war for 20 years in the Middle East, and we need to stop the war this the Middle East and not expand it.\u201d\n\nTapper asked, \u201cAre you suggesting that President Trump pulled the trigger and had Qasem Soleimani killed as a distraction from impeachment?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cLook, I think that people are reasonably asking about the timing and why it is that the administration seems to have all kinds of different answers. In the first 48 hours after this attack, what did we hear? Well, we heard it was for an imminent attack, and then we heard, no, no, it is to prevent any future attack, and then we heard that it is from the vice president himself and no, it is related to 9/11, and then we heard from president reports of people in the intelligence community saying that the whole, that the threat was overblown. You know, when the administration doesn\u2019t seem to have a coherent answer for taking a step like this. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, a step that puts everyone at risk, and step that puts the military at risk and puts the diplomats in the region at risk. And we have already paid a huge price for this war. Thousands of American lives lost, and a cost that we have paid domestically and around the world. At the same time, look at what it has done in the Middle East, millions of people who have been killed, who have been injured, who have been displaced. So this is not a moment when the president should be escalating tensions and moving us to war. The job of the president is to keep us safe, and that means move back from the edge.\u201d\n\nTapper pressed, \u201cDo you believe that President Trump pulled the trigger on this operation as a way to distract from impeachment? Is that what you think?\u201d\n\nWarren said, \u201cI think it is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration immediately after having taken this decision offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what is going on.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it is the right question to ask. We will get more information as we go forward but look at the timing on this. Look at what Donald Trump has said afterward and his administration. They have pointed in multiple directions. There is a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago and not a month from now, not a less aggressive and less dangerous response. He had a whole range of responses that were presented to him. He didn\u2019t pick one of the other ones. He picked the most aggressive and the one that moves us closer to war. So what does everybody talk about today? Are we going to war? Are we going to have another five years, tens, ten years of war in the Middle East, and dragged in once again. Are we bringing another generation of young people into war? That is every bit of the conversation right now. Donald Trump has taken an extraordinarily reckless step, and we have seen it before, he is using foreign policy and uses whatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/warren-questions-if-soleimani-strike-linked-to-impeachment-look-at-the-timing/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Buttigieg: No One Believes Trump Thought Out the Consequences of Soleimani Strike", "text": "On Sunday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful South Bend, IN Mayor Pete Buttigieg said no one believes President Donald Trump thought through the consequences of killing Qasem Soleimani.\n\nButtigieg said, \u201cI would not hesitate to use force if it is necessary to protect American lives, and the question is was it necessary and better than the alternative.

Qasem Soleimani, wrote Rep.

Now is the moment to prevent war & protect innocent people \u2013 the question for many is how, publicly & Congressionally: \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 3, 2020\n\nFriday, Trump defended the airstrike that killed the head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force by stating that it was done to prevent a conflict, not start one.\n\n\u201cWe took action last night to stop a war, we did not take action to start a war,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cSoleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion. We remember and honor the victims of Soleimani\u2019s many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Ocasio-Cortez urged her followers not to fall for the message of so-called \u201cwar advocates\u201d:\n\nWar advocates start off saying \u201cwe all want peace, but\u2026\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too late\u2026\u201d & frame a pro-peace agenda as na\u00efve to realpolitik.

Pollak.\n\nFriday, he wrote:\n\nMoreover, Soleimani\u2019s death actually improves the prospects for peace by encouraging the Iranian people to stand up against their rulers. The message to the Iranian people was clear: America is not against you, but against your oppressors. As if to help Trump, Iranian state TV reportedly stopped all programming to broadcast tributes to Soleimani.

Obviously, John Bolton, the former National Security adviser, said the opposite, as he has said many times before, but when President Trump says this is not about regime change, is he telling the truth?\u201d\n\nWhat matters is the U.S. deeds, not the words,\u201d Ravanchi responded. \u201cWhat they are doing against the Iranians are exactly to put lots of pressure on the Iranian people to stand up, and that is contravention of U.S. obligations based on international law.\u201d\n\nBurnett then tried to frame a moral moral equivalence between Soleimani, a known terrorist plotter, and Vice President Mike Pence, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cAmericans can understand though what the reaction would be, if someone that influential were killed here or killed in another country, but someone who was let\u2019s say, the Chief of the C.I.A., the Defense Secretary or even a Vice President. Does this death change the game completely between Iran and the United States?\u201d Burnett asked.\n\nIf CNN was this friendly to the Trump administration as it was with Iran\u2019s PR, perhaps its ratings wouldn\u2019t be at record lows.\n\nJournalist David Marcus of the Federalist condemned the softball interview, calling it \u201cjournalistic malpractice at best\u201d for not even asking about Iran\u2019s numerous military actions against the U.S. in recent months.\n\nHow on earth can one interview the Iranian ambassador without asking about Iranian support for a violent attack on an American embassy last week? Or how about an attack on a base that left an American contractor dead? Or the shooting down of an American drone over international waters?\n\nTime and again in the interview Ravanchi claimed that by killing Soleimani the US had moved from an economic war (pulling out of the Iran Deal) to a military war.

Obviously, John Bolton, the former National Security adviser, said the opposite, as he has said many times before, but when President Trump says this is not about regime change, is he telling the truth?\u201d\n\nWhat matters is the U.S. deeds, not the words,\u201d Ravanchi responded. \u201cWhat they are doing against the Iranians are exactly to put lots of pressure on the Iranian people to stand up, and that is contravention of U.S. obligations based on international law.\u201d\n\nBurnett then tried to frame a moral moral equivalence between Soleimani, a known terrorist plotter, and Vice President Mike Pence, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cAmericans can understand though what the reaction would be, if someone that influential were killed here or killed in another country, but someone who was let\u2019s say, the Chief of the C.I.A., the Defense Secretary or even a Vice President. Does this death change the game completely between Iran and the United States?\u201d Burnett asked.\n\nIf CNN was this friendly to the Trump administration as it was with Iran\u2019s PR, perhaps its ratings wouldn\u2019t be at record lows.\n\nJournalist David Marcus of the Federalist condemned the softball interview, calling it \u201cjournalistic malpractice at best\u201d for not even asking about Iran\u2019s numerous military actions against the U.S. in recent months.\n\nHow on earth can one interview the Iranian ambassador without asking about Iranian support for a violent attack on an American embassy last week? Or how about an attack on a base that left an American contractor dead? Or the shooting down of an American drone over international waters?\n\nTime and again in the interview Ravanchi claimed that by killing Soleimani the US had moved from an economic war (pulling out of the Iran Deal) to a military war.

Wages tend to equal the productivity of the worker. If Jones the chef can bring in thirty dollars an hour for Smith, the restaurant owner, Smith will have to pay Jones almost thirty dollars an hour, or else another restaurant can snag Jones away along with the revenue he offers.\n\nThis competition between employers over workers is the reason why 97.9 percent of hourly workers in the US make more than the federal minimum wage. The federal government doesn\u2019t mandate these high wages, but the market does.\n\nMany states have their own minimum wages set higher than the federal minimum wage, and yet many hourly employees in every state are paid higher than they are legally required to be, not because employers are generous, but because of worker productivity and competition over scarce labor.\n\nOne: Society Accumulates Capital Goods\n\nThe first way a worker\u2019s wage can grow requires nothing of the worker at all. Holding a given worker\u2019s situation constant, when the rest of society is able to produce more goods and services, prices will fall, and the real value of wages will increase.\n\nIf factories and workshops become more productive, even if this excludes a given worker\u2019s place of occupation, then when he goes to the supermarket, his paycheck will go farther. There are more goods to go around, and prices have fallen.\n\nThis raises the question, how does society become more productive? The two-step process is saving and investing in capital goods (the machines and tools that produce other goods). Rather than spending all earnings on ice cream and videogames, people save their money to maintain existing capital and invest in new tractors, machine tools, assembly lines, etc. Less present consumption is traded in for more future consumption.\n\nTwo: The Industry Upgrades Its Complementary Capital\n\nA second way a worker\u2019s wage can increase also requires nothing of the worker. His wage will rise if his industry upgrades the capital goods he uses and thereby makes him more productive.\n\nTextile workers who sew by hand get sewing machines, farm workers with scythes get combine harvesters, construction workers with shovels get bulldozers, etc. When this new capital allows workers to produce more for their employers (and society) than they could before, their value to their employers increases, and their wages increase.\n\nIn technical terms, new capital that is complementary to labor increases the productivity of, the demand for, and the price of labor.\n\nThis is the flip side of unemployment by automation. Sometimes capital is a substitute for labor, but it\u2019s often a complement. This is largely why workers in relatively capital-poor countries can earn multiples more when they move to countries rich with capital complementary to their labor, even holding their skills constant.\n\nThree: The Worker Accumulates Human Capital\n\nThe third route to higher wages comes from the worker himself and is the most obvious. If wages tend to equal productivity, workers can increase their wages by improving their skills to offer more to their employers\u2019 bottom lines, which also means contributing more to society\u2019s material provision.\n\nAlternatively, they could learn altogether new skills that are in higher demand and lower supply to secure new, higher-paying jobs.\n\nRemoving State Barriers\n\nUltimately, only sacrificing present consumption and investing in capital (physical or human) to increase productivity can move society forward against scarcity. Increasing productivity takes time, but the state has imposed many obstacles to productivity that would raise wages rapidly if removed.\n\nIt goes without saying that eliminating or reducing the income and payroll taxes would increase worker pay, but there are less obvious wage-reducing taxes.\n\nA sales tax is similar to destroying a portion of everything a worker makes, because the state takes a fraction of the item\u2019s sale receipts. In this way, the sales tax is a reduction of the worker\u2019s productivity, and consequently the wage the worker can command. After his paycheck is reduced, the worker pays the sales tax again, when everything he wants to buy is more expensive.\n\nA wealth tax, such as the one Elizabeth Warren is proposing, penalizes the ownership of capital goods, which drive the first two mechanisms for raising wages outlined above. The list of taxes goes on, and then there are the regulations, which won\u2019t be elaborated here. The accumulation of physical and human capital means more goods and services to go around for everyone, and a bigger paycheck for the worker.\n\n\n\nAlex Jones breaks down the active campaign to use subliminal messaging and programming to influence the public.\n\nAlso, start your year right with free shipping and up to 75% off our hottest items during the Mega Blowout Sale!", "link": "https://www.infowars.com/three-ways-to-increase-workers-wages/", "published": "2020-01-02T11:43:50-06:00"}, {"title": "Three Ways to Increase Workers\u2019 Wages", "text": "Free marketeers have rightly written many refutations of the minimum wage.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s difficult to beat something with nothing, and so this article will outline major ways in which wages actually rise: through capital accumulation and the honing of skills that others value.\n\nWhat Determines Wages?\n\nBefore looking at how wages can increase, what determines them in the first place?

Holding a given worker\u2019s situation constant, when the rest of society is able to produce more goods and services, prices will fall, and the real value of wages will increase.\n\nIf factories and workshops become more productive, even if this excludes a given worker\u2019s place of occupation, then when he goes to the supermarket, his paycheck will go farther. There are more goods to go around, and prices have fallen.\n\nThis raises the question, how does society become more productive? The two-step process is saving and investing in capital goods (the machines and tools that produce other goods). Rather than spending all earnings on ice cream and videogames, people save their money to maintain existing capital and invest in new tractors, machine tools, assembly lines, etc. Less present consumption is traded in for more future consumption.\n\nTwo: The Industry Upgrades Its Complementary Capital\n\nA second way a worker\u2019s wage can increase also requires nothing of the worker. His wage will rise if his industry upgrades the capital goods he uses and thereby makes him more productive.\n\nTextile workers who sew by hand get sewing machines, farm workers with scythes get combine harvesters, construction workers with shovels get bulldozers, etc. When this new capital allows workers to produce more for their employers (and society) than they could before, their value to their employers increases, and their wages increase.\n\nIn technical terms, new capital that is complementary to labor increases the productivity of, the demand for, and the price of labor.\n\nThis is the flip side of unemployment by automation. Sometimes capital is a substitute for labor, but it\u2019s often a complement. This is largely why workers in relatively capital-poor countries can earn multiples more when they move to countries rich with capital complementary to their labor, even holding their skills constant.\n\nThree: The Worker Accumulates Human Capital\n\nThe third route to higher wages comes from the worker himself and is the most obvious. If wages tend to equal productivity, workers can increase their wages by improving their skills to offer more to their employers\u2019 bottom lines, which also means contributing more to society\u2019s material provision.\n\nAlternatively, they could learn altogether new skills that are in higher demand and lower supply to secure new, higher-paying jobs.\n\nRemoving State Barriers\n\nUltimately, only sacrificing present consumption and investing in capital (physical or human) to increase productivity can move society forward against scarcity. Increasing productivity takes time, but the state has imposed many obstacles to productivity that would raise wages rapidly if removed.\n\nIt goes without saying that eliminating or reducing the income and payroll taxes would increase worker pay, but there are less obvious wage-reducing taxes.\n\nA sales tax is similar to destroying a portion of everything a worker makes, because the state takes a fraction of the item\u2019s sale receipts. In this way, the sales tax is a reduction of the worker\u2019s productivity, and consequently the wage the worker can command. After his paycheck is reduced, the worker pays the sales tax again, when everything he wants to buy is more expensive.\n\nA wealth tax, such as the one Elizabeth Warren is proposing, penalizes the ownership of capital goods, which drive the first two mechanisms for raising wages outlined above. The list of taxes goes on, and then there are the regulations, which won\u2019t be elaborated here. The accumulation of physical and human capital means more goods and services to go around for everyone, and a bigger paycheck for the worker.\n\n\n\nAlex Jones breaks down the active campaign to use subliminal messaging and programming to influence the public.\n\nAlso, start your year right with free shipping and up to 75% off our hottest items during the Mega Blowout Sale!", "link": "https://www.infowars.com/three-ways-to-increase-workers-wages/#vuukle-comments", "published": "2020-01-02T11:43:50-06:00"}, {"title": "Hunter-Gatherers Ravaged the Environment.

Wilson also hit Metcalf for a 53-yard score in the third quarter and the rookie ended the day with seven catches for 160 yards.\n\nMetcalf set a Super Bowl-era rookie record for receiving yards while Wilson just added to his glittering playoff resume.

Miles Sanders couldn\u2019t catch a pass thrown slightly behind him on the first and McCown was sacked while trying to find someone open on the second.\n\nThat was the seventh sack of the game for a Seahawks defense that only had 28 of them in the regular season.

That forced the Saints to go to a heavier-than-normal dose of Taysom Hill, who responded. Hill threw a 50-yard pass, caught a touchdown, and had a number of impressive runs (and blocks) along the way.\n\nThey forced overtime as the Vikings played it safe, but Cousins never let them have the ball back in the extra session, quieting much of the criticism for a guy who has struggled in prime time and hadn\u2019t won a playoff game.\n\nUntil today.\n\nFor the Saints, it was just their second home loss in the playoffs under coach Sean Payton, but their second in a row after last year\u2019s NFC Championship Game loss to the Rams.

It was unclear exactly how the attack unfolded, but pictures of the aftermath indicated that al-Shabab was able to detonate explosives where U.S. military equipment such as helicopters and other aircraft would have been stationed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. military statement said reports indicated damage to six \"contractor-operated civilian aircraft.\"\n\nU.S. forces train Kenyan soldiers at a base attached to the airstrip known as Camp Simba, and they use the airstrip for aerial missions against al-Shabab in Somalia. The U.S. Africa Command had said in an earlier statement that the attack had been repelled with the cooperation of Kenyan forces. It was unclear whether there were any Kenyan casualties.\n\nKenyan Defence Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Njuguna said the bodies of five attackers were found.\n\nFor its part, al-Shabab said it had inflicted \u201csevere casualties\u201d on both American and Kenyan forces and confirmed that it had destroyed U.S. aircraft and vehicles.\n\nAD\n\nIn the U.S. statement, Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of Africom, said that the United States would, along with its African and international partners, pursue the perpetrators of the attack. He also said they remain committed to preventing al-Shabab from maintaining a haven to plan attacks.\n\nAD\n\nAl-Shabab, which is affiliated with al-Qaeda, has mounted a string of attacks in Kenya recently, including multiple ambushes on passenger buses traveling in the region close to the Somali border. Last Saturday, the group bombed a busy intersection in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 80 people. Almost a year ago, al-Shabab staged its most daring attack on Kenyan soil in half a decade when multiple gunmen stormed a luxury hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, causing a 20-hour siege in which at least 21 civilians were killed.\n\nAl-Shabab controls most of rural southern and central Somalia and regularly attacks Mogadishu. The group seeks to impose a strict version of Islamic law and to expel foreign troops from the country. In addition to about 500 U.S. personnel in Somalia, the African Union sponsors a coalition of about 20,000 troops, mostly from Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda.\n\nAD\n\nThe group gets most of its funding from an extensive protection racket that functions like a parallel taxation system throughout the country. It is paid tens of millions of dollars a year by farmers, business owners and others who are threatened with death if they don\u2019t pay.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. military has led a largely aerial campaign against al-Shabab for much of the past decade. In 2017, President Trump loosened the U.S. military\u2019s rules of engagement in Somalia, allowing for greater offensive use of force. Since then, the U.S. military has increased drone strikes and carried out a record 63 strikes in 2019, in which it claims to have killed hundreds of al-Shabab fighters.\n\nRael Ombuor in Nairobi contributed to this report."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/ghosns-mounting-despair-at-japanese-justice-may-have-convinced-him-to-flee/2020/01/05/7dfe92fe-2fa9-11ea-9313-6cba89b1b9fb_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T12:44:00", "title": "Ghosn\u2019s mounting despair at Japanese justice may have persuaded him to flee", "text": "The lawyer\u2019s impassioned defense of Ghosn and scathing attack on Japan\u2019s legal system has divided opinion here, even as the country\u2019s justice minister broke a week of silence to defend the treatment of the flamboyant business executive.\n\nAD\n\nJustice Minister Masako Mori called Ghosn\u2019s departure \u201cpresumably illegal,\u201d unjustifiable and \u201cextremely regrettable,\u201d adding there was no record of him leaving the country.\n\nAD\n\nIn her first statement after a week-long New Year\u2019s holiday here, she promised a thorough investigation and directed the Immigration Services Agency to tighten immigration procedures at departure.\n\nGhosn has said he was fleeing political persecution and a rigged justice system.\n\nTakano described how Ghosn would ask his lawyers the same question again and again as the months went by: Could he expect a fair trial in Japan? Their answer was always no \u2014 no criminal defendant in Japan can expect a fair trial. Still, they argued, the evidence against him was weak, and there was still a good chance they would establish his innocence.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors enjoy considerable powers in Japan, and once they decide to accept a case, conviction rates are around 99 percent. But more than any other lawyers in this country, Ghosn\u2019s defense team had a track record of getting people off the hook.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPlease trust us,\u201d Takano would tell Ghosn.\n\n\u201cApparently, his doubts and concerns began to grow,\u201d Takano said, alleging prosecutors were slow to respond to requests for the disclosure of evidence, imposed minute restrictions on how evidence would be disclosed and even eliminated some of the evidence, all the while leaking \u201cas much as they liked\u201d to the Japanese media.\n\nIn his regular meetings with his lawyers, Ghosn\u2019s frustration showed in his face as he asked questions, Takano said. But over time the questions became fewer, as anger gave way to despair.\n\nGhosn was accused of four charges of financial misconduct while running Nissan, including underreporting his income and using company money for his own benefit. But he says he was the victim of a conspiracy among prosecutors, officials and Nissan to block his plans to deepen the company\u2019s merger with its French partner, Renault.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven Renault, initially supportive, said its internal investigations had found evidence of unethical practices. Nevertheless, Japanese business executives accused of far more serious crimes have been let off or given little more than a slap on the wrist, and many foreign executives here see Ghosn\u2019s treatment as an example of double standards.\n\nBut stresses on his family life may also have played a role in his decision to flee.\n\nUnder the terms of his bail, Ghosn was forbidden by the court from meeting his wife Carole, or even speaking to her for seven months, on the grounds they might conspire to tamper with evidence.\n\n\u201cThis is a criminal punishment,\u201d Ghosn complained to his lawyers. \u201cWhen am I ever going to be able to lead a normal family life?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Ghosn was allowed a one-hour video call with Carole, in a lawyer\u2019s office, the first in a month. They talked about their children, relatives and friends, their lives and their memories, Takano said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was no shortage of things to talk about,\u201d Takano said. \u201cJust when the time had come for them to stop after an hour, he spoke to the display: \u2018My relationship with you cannot be replaced by children and friends. You are my indispensable presence. I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said he was deeply moved.\n\n\u201cI have never felt such strong despair over Japan\u2019s legal system as I did at that time. I felt something nearly close to a sense of wanting to kill. I said to him \u2018Carlos, I am very sorry. Truly, the Japanese system is shameful. I will do our utmost to improve this situation as soon as possible,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nGhosn didn\u2019t respond.\n\nOn Dec. 25, just a day after his video call, Ghosn learned that his trial, initially expected to begin in April, could be delayed further, possibly into 2021, lawyers and friends say. That news played a part in his decision to flee, his friend Ricardo Karam said, a suggestion supported by another of Ghosn\u2019s defense lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wonder if he was strongly shocked in those two days,\u201d he told the Asahi newspaper.\n\nFour days later, at noon on Dec. 29, Ghosn strolled out of his home, alone, never to return, Japan\u2019s NHK reported.\n\nAlthough surveillance cameras had been installed outside the property, the system was only designed to prevent him from holding unauthorized meetings and not to keep him under house arrest, and footage was only handed over to the court once a month, Takano says.\n\nAD\n\nConcerned that Ghosn could tamper with evidence, Nissan had hired a private security firm to track him when he left his home, Reuters and Japan\u2019s Sankei newspaper reported.\n\nBut on Dec. 27, Ghosn\u2019s lawyers filed a criminal complaint to Tokyo police about the surveillance, and it was withdrawn, Hironaka told the Asahi newspaper.\n\nGhosn bypassed immigration at Osaka\u2019s Kansai airport by hiding in a large black case typically used to carry audio gear, according to the Wall Street Journal, while his name was not included on the plane\u2019s passenger manifest.\n\nOn Sunday, the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office said Ghosn\u2019s escape constituted a crime. It also defended the country\u2019s legal system, arguing that although conviction rates are high, defendants are given a proper chance to present their case and courts reach judgments strictly on the basis of the evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGhosn was initially detained for more than 100 days, released on bail and then rearrested in April shortly after he announced plans to speak to the press. He was finally released on bail again for a further amount of nearly $5 million, after convincing the court he was not a flight risk.\n\nTakano said he learned of Ghosn\u2019s escape only through news reports.\n\n\u201cInitially, I felt a strong anger, a sense of having been betrayed. Yet, looking back how he has been treated by this country\u2019s legal system, my anger went in a different direction,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed I was betrayed. But it is not Carlos Ghosn who betrayed me.\u201d\n\nBut Takahiro Saito, deputy chief of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, defended the decision to detain Ghosn for so long, and oppose bail, arguing he had \u201csignificant influence\u201d inside Japan and around the world, and there had been a realistic danger he would destroy evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe defendant Ghosn had abundant financial power and multiple foreign bases.

Instead, it basked in a surge of nationalist sentiment and anger at home. Less than two months ago, security forces are said to have killed hundreds of Iranian protesters to quell an uprising spurred by the regime\u2019s dysfunctional management of the country\u2019s crippled economy. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured into the streets of Iranian cities to mourn a fallen hero and decry the \u201cimperialist\u201d power that killed him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump helped stoke the flames even further with a tweet threatening the destruction of Iranian cultural sites \u2014 what most international legal scholars would tell you is a war crime \u2014 should the regime seek vengeance for the death of Soleimani.\n\n\u201cAt a time when his unprecedented sanctions had stirred unrest inside Iran, the political elite has just been handed a rallying cry,\u201d wrote Mohammad Ali Shabani, a researcher at Soas University in London. \u201cThe strike on Suleimani, whose status approached that of national icon, will harden popular sentiment against the U.S. while simultaneously shoring up the regime.\u201d\n\n#Iran Sunday:\n\nGen. #Soleimani's funeral reaches Mashahd.

Iranian authorities said that they would no longer abide by restrictions on uranium enrichment, but would return to their previous commitments should the United States withdraw the sanctions whose imposition were also a violation of the pact. The announcement had been expected before Soleimani\u2019s assassination but took on a darker cast as tensions mounted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Iraq, too, the backlash was swift. The country\u2019s parliament voted on Sunday to ask for the removal of U.S. troops on Iraqi soil. The resolution was nonbinding and \u201cdid not immediately imperil the U.S. presence in Iraq,\u201d wrote The Post\u2019s Erin Cunningham, \u201cbut it highlights the head winds the Trump administration faces after the strike, which was seen in Iraq as a violation of sovereignty and as a dangerous escalation by governments across the Middle East.\u201d\n\nFor President Trump and some of the Washington foreign policy establishment, though, it still may be worth it. In Trump\u2019s words, Soleimani was \u201cthe number one terrorist in the world,\u201d the mastermind behind a generation of asymmetric warfare in the region, as well as various plots against America. In briefings with reporters, U.S. officials justified the targeted killing of Soleimani as an act of \u201cdeterrence\u201d based on intelligence that the senior leader was planning a number of \u201cimminent\u201d possible attacks on U.S. interests. But other officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to my colleagues and other outlets, suggested that the evidence of Soleimani\u2019s direct involvement was \u201crazor thin\u201d and that Trump had chosen the most extreme path of retaliation after pro-Iran militiamen ransacked sections of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq last week.\n\nSoleimani was the head of the Quds Force, a wing of Iran\u2019s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that steers the regime\u2019s proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. These factions have been locked in months of shadow conflict with the United States and its allies in the wake of Trump\u2019s reimposition of sweeping sanctions on Iran after quitting the Obama-era nuclear deal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn one hand, the Trump administration believes its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran is working and that killing Soleimani adds to the regime\u2019s internal strains. But Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region \u2014 a key reason cited by Trump for reneging on the nonproliferation pact \u2014 have only spiked in recent months, including alleged attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq, shipping in the Persian Gulf and a major Saudi oil facility.\n\n....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.

But the path ahead remains deeply treacherous. \u201cMy sense is that we will see an escalation in Iraq,\u201d said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, to my colleague Liz Sly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Iranians really want a war with the U.S. I don\u2019t think they are interested in an all-out regional conflict. The problem is that all it takes is one small error and the whole region would be engulfed.\"\n\nAmid the crisis, the United States ordered American citizens to leave Iraq and suspended its military cooperation and training programs with Iraqi security forces. The latter action risks undermining the ongoing effort to defeat the extremist Islamic State. And the Trump administration has hardly rallied a united front to its cause, with Pompeo bemoaning how European allies \u2014 who are trying to keep afloat the gutted husk of the nuclear deal \u2014 were \u201cnot helpful\u201d enough.\n\n\u201cFor European capitals,\u201d wrote Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cthis means their worst predictions \u2014 they warned the Trump administration that withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal would trigger a chain of escalation with Iran \u2014 are becoming reality.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/body-of-commander-slain-by-us-strike-arrives-in-iran-to-crowds-of-mourners/2020/01/05/4ca3281a-2f17-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T14:37:00", "title": "Iran announces it is suspending its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal", "text": "\"Iran's nuclear program will now be based solely on its technical needs,\" the statement said.

It added that Iran will continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement came as the region continued to grapple with the fallout of a U.S. drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, as he traveled in a convoy near the Baghdad airport Friday. The strike also killed a key Iraq militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.\n\nIraq\u2019s caretaker prime minister urged parliament on Sunday to take \u201curgent measures\u201d to force the withdrawal of foreign forces following the strike. In an address to the legislature, Adel Abdul Mahdi recommended that the government establish a timetable for the departure of foreign troops, including the members of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State militant group, \u201cfor the sake of our national sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened was a political assassination,\u201d Abdul Mahdi said.\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers responded by passing a nonbinding resolution calling on the government to end the foreign troop presence in Iraq. But Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November and has been serving in a caretaker role, is not legally authorized to sign the bill into law.\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, the vote Sunday did not immediately imperil the U.S. presence in Iraq, but it highlights the head winds the Trump administration faces after the strike, which was seen in Iraq as a violation of sovereignty and as a dangerous escalation by governments across the Middle East.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One, President Trump said the United States would put \u201cvery big sanctions on Iraq\u201d if the country forced out U.S. troops.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf they do ask us to leave, if we don\u2019t do it in a very friendly basis. We will charge them sanctions like they\u2019ve never seen before ever,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\u201d\n\nTrump also warned that he expected Iraq to compensate the United States for an air base there.\n\n\u201cWe have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that\u2019s there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We\u2019re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the spiraling consequences, the U.S.-led coalition said it had paused its training mission in Iraq because of \u201crepeated rocket attacks over the last two months\u201d by the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia. It will now focus on protecting its bases from attack, the coalition said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis has limited our capacity to conduct training with partners and to support their operations\u201d against the Islamic State, it said. \u201cWe have therefore paused these activities.\u201d\n\nBut in appearances on morning talk shows Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dismissed calls for U.S. troops to leave Iraq, saying on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Abdul Mahdi is \u201cunder enormous threats from the very Iranian leadership that it is that we are pushing back against.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nState Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Washington was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the Iraqi lawmakers\u2019 move, and urged them to reconsider as the United States seeks \u201cfurther clarification on the legal nature and impact of today\u2019s resolution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe it is in the shared interests of the United States and Iraq to continue fighting ISIS together,\u201d she said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nIran, meanwhile, said Sunday that it will limit its response to the drone attack to U.S. military targets.\n\n\u201cThe response for sure will be military and against military sites,\u201d Hossein Dehghan, the military adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThe only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow they have inflicted.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview with Iranian state television aired Monday, Esmail Ghaani, the general who replaced Soleimani as commander of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, vowed to avenge his predecessor\u2019s death.\n\nDehghan\u2019s remarks came as Trump threatened Saturday on Twitter to strike \u201c52 Iranian sites . . . some at a very high level & important to Iran and the Iranian culture\u201d should Tehran retaliate against Americans or U.S. interests in the region. Iran has 24 locations on the U.N. list of cultural world heritage sites.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nIf Trump were to carry out his threats, Dehghan said, \u201cno American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump later tweeted: \u201cThese Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Iraqi military said late Sunday that six rockets had landed in Baghdad, including three inside the Green Zone, a fortified neighborhood housing many foreigners and the U.S. Embassy.\n\nA U.S. diplomat said rockets apparently hit a vehicle lot in the embassy compound.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement, echoed Dehghan\u2019s statement, declaring Sunday that as retribution for Soleimani\u2019s death, U.S. troops in the Middle East, and not U.S. civilians, should be targeted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is the U.S. military that killed Haj Qasem, and they must pay the price,\u201d Nasrallah said, referring to Soleimani. \u201cTouching any civilian anywhere in the world will only serve Trump\u2019s policy.\u201d\n\nU.S. allies widely share concerns about the consequences of Soleimani\u2019s death. NATO will convene an emergency meeting of its ambassadors Monday to discuss the situation in Iraq. NATO suspended its training programs in the country, and several member nations have scrambled to protect their troops and citizens there.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Embassy released a security alert Sunday advising Americans of \u201cthe heightened risk of missile and drone attacks\u201d against both civilian and military targets.\n\nThe United States blamed Iran for a drone and cruise missile attack on Saudi state oil facilities in September, a strike that knocked half of the nation\u2019s oil production offline.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Saudi officials have long urged the United States to take stronger action against what they say is Iran\u2019s unchecked expansionism in the region, they have also expressed discomfort at the rising tensions between Washington and Tehran.\n\nAbdul Mahdi suggested Sunday that Iran and the Saudis had been engaged in dialogue to tamp down their feud, with Iraq playing the role of mediator. Abdul Mahdi said he had been expecting to meet with Soleimani on the day he was killed. \u201cHe came to deliver me a message from Iran, responding to the message we delivered from Saudi Arabia to Iran,\u201d the prime minister said, without providing details.\n\nIn Iran, Soleimani\u2019s body was flown in a flag-draped coffin to the southwestern city of Ahvaz, following a funeral procession in Baghdad and Iraq\u2019s twin Shiite shrine cities, Karbala and Najaf. It was later carried to the northeastern city of Mashhad, home to the shrine of Imam Reza, a revered figure in Shiite Islam. Iran is ruled by a Shiite theocracy.\n\nAD\n\nFootage broadcast on Iranian state television showed tens of thousands of black-clad mourners waving flags and chanting religious slogans. Iran\u2019s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency described the scene as \u201cglorious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll schools and businesses are closed today \u2014 he was popular here and even more popular now,\u201d said Farnaz, 33, a computer engineer and resident of Ahvaz, referring to Soleimani. Like other Iranians contacted Sunday, she spoke on the condition that her full name not be used so she could speak freely.\n\n\u201cPeople here . . . saw Soleimani as an important and charismatic commander who was protecting their security,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, Ahvaz and other cities in oil-rich Khuzestan province, home to a large ethnic Arab minority, have a history of anti-government unrest. On Sunday, an unverified video posted online showed masked youths setting fire to a billboard commemorating Soleimani.\n\nThe slain commander\u2019s procession will continue Monday to the holy city of Qom and the capital, Tehran, where Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, will lead prayers at the ceremony. Soleimani will be buried in his hometown, Kerman, on Tuesday."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuelas-last-democratic-institution-falls-as-maduro-stages-de-facto-takeover-of-national-assembly/2020/01/05/8ba496fe-2d8f-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T13:05:00", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s last democratic institution falls as Maduro attempts de facto takeover of National Assembly", "text": "The dramatic events marked a sharp escalation in Maduro\u2019s gambit to end Guaid\u00f3\u2019s quest to unseat him and sparked immediate condemnation by Washington, which has strongly backed the 36-year-old opposition leader. Opposition officials declared the move an effective \u201cparliamentary coup\u201d meant to consolidate Maduro\u2019s near-dictatorial powers.\n\n\u201cToday, they dismantled the rule of law, assassinating the republic, with the complicity of a group of traitor lawmakers,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told reporters outside the parliamentary building.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater Sunday, Guaid\u00f3 sought to counter the move by gathering opposition lawmakers at the headquarters of El Nacional, a local newspaper, to cast an official vote. In a 100-to-0 tally \u2014 enough to put him over the top in a full session of the 167-seat chamber \u2014 those present reelected Guaid\u00f3 as head of the legislature. Twenty-eight of the 100 were votes from stand-ins of exiled lawmakers.\n\nBut Maduro, in an address to the nation, hailed what he called the National Assembly\u2019s \u201cnew leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very corrupt person leaves the presidency of the National Assembly today, as a millionaire, a billionaire,\u201d said Maduro, referring to Guaid\u00f3. He added, \u201cto justify their defeat, they say that a security operation was launched\u201d to stop them.\n\nAD\n\nThe attempt to replace Guaid\u00f3 \u2014 who declared himself interim president a year ago and promised to oust Maduro for claiming reelection in a tainted 2018 vote \u2014 appeared to be a carefully organized plan many weeks in the making.\n\nAD\n\nOpposition officials have warned since last month that Maduro\u2019s government was handing out suitcases of cash to woo lawmakers. But they thought they had successfully countered the operation, and on Sunday, Guaid\u00f3 began the day anticipating his reelection as head of the National Assembly, viewed internationally as the last democratic institution in the authoritarian South American state. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim as the nation\u2019s true president \u2014 recognized by nearly 60 countries, including the United States \u2014 has been based on his status as the assembly\u2019s chief.\n\nBut security forces loyal to Maduro formed a cordon early Sunday around the assembly building in central Caracas, blocking some opposition lawmakers from entering. Lawmakers who back Maduro \u2014 including several allegedly involved in a government plot to buy votes \u2014 were allowed to pass. At one point, Guaid\u00f3 sought to scale the spiked wrought-iron fence surrounding the assembly and force his way in, according to a video issued by the opposition.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, Luis Parra \u2014 a former opposition politician who was one of several lawmakers accused last month of accepting government bribes \u2014 announced his surprise candidacy against Guaid\u00f3 via Twitter on Sunday morning. Hours later, his swearing-in was shown on state television.\n\nParra is thought to have had the support of at least 40 lawmakers from Maduro\u2019s party and an unknown number of others who the opposition claims have been bribed. But there was no evidence that an actual vote had taken place. The opposition also insisted that there had been no legal quorum because Guaid\u00f3, the chamber\u2019s leader, had not been present to validate the session.\n\nAD\n\nSedition within the opposition, however, appeared to run deeper than some had feared. For instance, Luis Stefanelli, an opposition lawmaker who fled the country after claiming to reject a government bribe, had appointed a \u201cloyal\u201d stand-in to vote in favor of Guaid\u00f3 on Sunday. But he said in a tweet that his stand-in had \u201cbetrayed him\u201d and had instead stood with the government\u2019s pick, Parra.\n\nAD\n\nThe government\u2019s action appeared designed to complicate Guaid\u00f3\u2019s international recognition and provide some nations that might be considering pulling their support for him additional legal cover to do so.\n\nBut the move also creates new logistical and technical hurdles for an already beleaguered opposition, including how and where to continue meeting and passing legislation.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s strongest backers \u2014 particularly in Washington \u2014 disregarded Sunday\u2019s maneuvers in the National Assembly as dictatorial theatrics. The move comes as the United States \u2014 which has slapped tough sanctions on Maduro\u2019s government, including an oil embargo \u2014 is weighing more confrontational steps, such as a possible naval blockade of Venezuelan oil being shipped to Cuba, the Maduro government\u2019s chief regional ally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated Guaid\u00f3 on his \u201cre-election\u201d and condemned the \u201cfailed efforts\u201d by Maduro to \u201cnegate the will of the democratically elected National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHe charged Maduro\u2019s government with seeking to \u201cforcibly\u201d deny access to Guaid\u00f3 and other lawmakers after realizing its campaign of \u201cbribery and intimidation\u201d had failed to secure enough votes to oust him.\n\n\u201cJuan Guaido personifies the Venezuelan people\u2019s struggle to reclaim the prosperity and democracy they once enjoyed,\u201d Pompeo said in the statement. \u201cNo regime thugs, no jail cells, and no bribery or intimidation can subvert the will of the Venezuelan people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFew immediately saw Maduro as gaining international support from the move. A host of nations, including Brazil, Canada and Chile, quickly rejected Sunday\u2019s attempt to install Parra. In a statement, the European Union said Sunday\u2019s \u201cserious irregularities\u201d constituted \u201ca new step in the deterioration of the Venezuelan crisis. As a consequence, the E.U. continues to recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate President of the National Assembly until the conditions for a proper voting session can be assured.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Maduro government has made attempts to declaw the National Assembly since the opposition won a sweeping majority in 2015. In 2016, the pro-Maduro Supreme Court officially stripped it of its legislative authority. A year later, the court announced it would dissolve the institution, a threat it never followed through on after the ruling generated internal controversy and street protests. In 2017, Maduro\u2019s government created a \u201cConstituent Assembly,\u201d made up exclusively of its own backers, which sought to supplant the National Assembly\u2019s authority.\n\nBut the opposition has managed to keep the institution at the center of its fight to oust Maduro, holding sessions weekly and using it as a legal backup to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the presidency. It has given Guaid\u00f3 constitutional legitimacy in the eyes of foreign powers, based on the fact that he and his supporters were elected by a majority in 2015 \u2014 the last time a vote here was seen as generally democratic.\n\nAD\n\nThe government\u2019s bold move on Sunday comes at a dangerous time for the opposition. After a year in which many Venezuelans believe he overpromised how quickly Maduro could be forced from office, Guaid\u00f3 has seen his popularity sharply slip. Attempts to turn the nation\u2019s top military brass against Maduro have failed, and the opposition is reeling from accusations of turncoats and festering corruption within its own ranks.\n\nAD\n\nLast month, Parra was ejected from one of the main opposition parties, Primero Justicia, after being accused of accepting bribes in exchange for lobbying on behalf of pro-Maduro business executives. Opposition officials also claim that he is one of several lawmakers who have accepted bribes to abandon Guaid\u00f3 \u2014 an allegation Parra has denied even as he has begun to openly criticize Guaid\u00f3.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s team, in anticipation of victory on Sunday, had drafted plans to \u201crelaunch\u201d his presidency \u2014 including increasing the pressure on Maduro and spearheading more and better distribution of medicine and food in a nation brought to its knees by one of the world\u2019s worst economic collapse\u2019s in recent history.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the equivalent of a coup against an institution that was legitimately elected,\u201d said Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, director of the Caracas-based Datanalisis polling agency. \u201cWe only add one more illegitimate institution to the game that will not be recognized by the opposition\u2019s international allies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cfor an opposition that had already been weakened, this is not good news. It loses operational capacity and becomes more dependent on an international community that doesn\u2019t have much more maneuvering power left.\u201d\n\nFaiola reported from Miami.

Gen. Qasem Soleimani, one of Iran\u2019s top military figures and leader of its special-operations forces abroad.\n\nWho Soleimani was: As the leader of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 elite Quds Force, Soleimani was key in training Iran\u2019s allies across the region, especially in Iraq. Soleimani\u2019s influence was imprinted on various Shiite militias that fought U.S. troops.\n\nHow we got here: Tensions had been escalating between Iran and the United States since Trump pulled out of an Obama-era nuclear deal and spiked shortly before the airstrike. On Tuesday, supporters of an Iranian-backed militia, Kataib Hezbollah, breached the gates of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, demanding that U.S. troops and diplomats leave the country. The militia supporters were protesting the killing of 25 fighters in U.S. airstrikes. The strikes were carried out in response to the death of a U.S. contractor in a rocket attack against a military base in Kirkuk that the United States blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWhat happens next: Soleimani\u2019s killing could be a catalyst for greater violence, experts warned. Iran vowed \u201csevere revenge\u201d in response, while U.S. outposts braced for retaliatory attacks and oil prices rose.

It\u2019s worth noting \u2014 especially because, in a legal context, it may not mean exactly what the average person thinks it does.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAn imminent threat is what you would need to justify taking an action in self-defense,\u201d said Oona Hathaway, a professor of international law at Yale University and a former national security lawyer in the Defense Department\u2019s Office of General Counsel.\n\nAD\n\nThe word has been repeatedly used by Trump and other members of his administration to describe alleged plots against U.S. personnel in the Middle East that they say Soleimani was facilitating and that the strike on him may have prevented.\n\nTrump has spoken of \u201cimminent and sinister attacks,\u201d but the administration has provided little detail about the alleged plots or why the threat was deemed imminent. \u201cWe know it was imminent,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during an interview with CNN on Friday, without offering any specifics.\n\nAD\n\nHathaway noted that the word was not used in the initial Pentagon statement announcing the strike against Soleimani. \u201cIt makes me wonder whether the lawyers realized that they had a problem on their hands,\u201d she said.\n\nAs leader of the elite Quds Force, a branch of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Soleimani had certainly played a role in significant plots against U.S. personnel in the past. There is little reason to believe that he was not involved in similar plots shortly before his death.\n\nAD\n\nIt is unclear, however, what specific evidence tied him to a new plot or how this evidence showed that neutralizing him would have foiled such a plot.\n\nAD\n\nBut the administration\u2019s frequent use of \u201cimminent\u201d is probably not a coincidence. Both domestic and international law, in theory, place limits on a U.S. president\u2019s ability to unilaterally engage in a military conflict with a foreign power: The 1973 War Powers Resolution, for example, states that a U.S. president requires congressional authorization to go to war.\n\nSome analysts said the Trump administration appears unsure how to legally present its case for the killing of Soleimani.\n\nNational security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien has told reporters that the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution allowed the killing of Soleimani, an argument that is almost certain to be disputed by lawyers and members of Congress because of the starkly different context of the Friday strike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut by repeatedly describing an Iranian plot against U.S. personnel as \u201cimminent,\u201d the administration is making a potentially more persuasive argument: Its move against Soleimani was an act of self-defense, not aggression.\n\nIn both domestic and international law, that is an important distinction, and the idea of an imminent threat adds weight to it. \u201cImminence is relevant legally mainly as a way of constructing an argument of anticipatory self-defense,\u201d said David Bosco, a professor at Indiana University\u2019s Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution names the president as the commander in chief of the United States; it is generally accepted that this grants him or her the unilateral power to \u201crepel sudden attack.\u201d The Charter of the United Nations says there is an \u201cinherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe right to self-defense is widely understood to extend beyond attacks that have already occurred. \u201cIt is well-established that countries can respond preemptively if there is an imminent attack that gives little other option,\u201d Bosco said.\n\nHowever, it may not mean that the United States had evidence of a specific upcoming plot. The U.S. government generally takes a broad view of what imminent may mean. Though the Trump administration has been accused of taking a lax view of legal requirements, this broad definition predates it.\n\nIn an April 2016 speech that sought to explain the legal justification for the U.S. involvement in war against the Islamic State militant group, State Department legal adviser Brian Egan argued that there didn\u2019t even need to be specific information about a threat for it to be considered imminent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe absence of specific evidence of where an attack will take place or of the precise nature of an attack does not preclude a conclusion that an armed attack is imminent for purposes of the exercise of the right of self-defense,\u201d Egan said.\n\nA November 2012 speech by Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general in the Obama administration, justified the killing of members of al-Qaeda by suggesting that the group\u2019s past violence showed it could pose a continued threat.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not require the president to delay action until some theoretical end stage of planning \u2014 when the precise time, place and manner of an attack become clear,\u201d Holder said.\n\nAD\n\nIn this instance, Soleimani\u2019s history of helping facilitate attacks on U.S. troops may have been enough to legally justify his killing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question from a legal perspective of what he may have been planning next,\u201d said Bobby Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, first and foremost, of what he has done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nControversially, this broad definition is arguably not what most people would think of when they hear the words \u201cimminent attack.\u201d However, domestic national security law is often defined by executive branch lawyers and only rarely challenged in courts, and international law has limited recourse for a powerful nation like the United States.\n\n\u201cPeople want the law to do a lot of work here that perhaps strategy and policy need to do,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a lawyer with the National Security Council during the Obama administration who is now a law professor at Georgetown. He said he doubted the strike could face serious legal challenge.\n\nAD\n\nHathaway argued, however, that Trump\u2019s strike was probably unconstitutional. That the administration did not notify the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bipartisan U.S. senators, as well as Trump\u2019s continued threats to Iran in the wake of the military operation, would diminish the argument that the strike on Soleimani was carried out in self-defense.\n\nBut she also said it was unlikely that courts would step in. \u201cCongress really is the only bulwark against the president who wants to unilaterally use force,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it was lawful if it was a terrible idea,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake to equate legality with wisdom.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/climate-change-is-playing-havoc-with-mexicos-monarch-butterfly-migration/2019/12/23/e60c1e0e-21ab-11ea-b034-de7dc2b5199b_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T11:00:00", "title": "Climate change is playing havoc with Mexico\u2019s monarch butterfly migration", "text": "No one knows when millions of monarch butterflies began crisscrossing North America, spending their winters clustered on the same hillsides in Central Mexico, a blaze of orange wings in the green forest.\n\nBut over the centuries, they were mythologized by generations of humans. Locals believed they carried the souls of their ancestors. Scientists saw the migration as the proof of insect evolution \u2014 a brittle organism that could fly 6,000 miles a year to avoid severe weather.\n\nThe butterflies are among the world\u2019s experts in climate adaptation. They spend their summers in the northern United States and Canada; they breed in the southern United States during the fall and spring; and most spend their winters here in Central Mexico, in a few giant clusters.\n\nTheir life cycles are driven by a search for optimal conditions: temperatures ideally between 55 and the low 70s when they migrate, some rain during their winters and plenty of milkweed when they mate. The criteria are narrow \u2014 and dependent on relatively consistent weather patterns.\n\nThat consistency no longer exists.\n\nNow summer temperatures in the Midwest are soaring. The milkweed in Texas is drying up. Winter storms, once rare, are snaking through central Mexico regularly as air warms over the Pacific Ocean and blows across the region.\n\n\u201cThe question we\u2019re asking is \u2018Can one of the world\u2019s most adaptive insects adapt to climate change?\u2019\u201d asked Karen Oberhauser, who studies the species at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cWe are changing the conditions and just waiting to see.\u201d\n\n[The smelly seaweed that turned Mexico\u2019s beaches into a rancid mess]\n\nBetween 1990 and 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says, a billion butterflies vanished.\n\nBecause over 95 percent of the population migrates en masse to a few patches of Mexican forest, each smaller than half a football field, a single storm or heat stroke could effectively kill off the population. (A smaller percentage of the butterflies winter in Southern California or Florida, where they face their own challenges.)\n\nThat nearly happened in 2002, when a winter storm killed about 75 percent of monarchs. And again in 2012, when a heat wave in the Midwest killed tens of thousands.\n\n\u201cAt every stage in their migration, they are threatened by climate change,\u201d said Eduardo Rend\u00f3n, the monarch butterfly coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund in Mexico.\n\n\n\nEach time, they rebounded \u2014 but barely. Last year, the population grew when a cold front in North Texas forced butterflies to stay in South Texas for longer than usual, increasing the length of their breeding season.\n\nBut this year brought another scare, as temperatures in Oklahoma and Kansas soared as monarchs passed through. It was the second hottest September in 125 years in those states. The impact on the population has not yet been calculated.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking 20, 30, 40 years out, we\u2019re not going to be talking about monarchs any more,\u201d said Chip Taylor, the founder of Monarch Watch and a professor at the University of Kansas.\n\n[Alberta, Canada: Rat-free for 70 years!]\n\n\n\nEvery year, millions of monarch butterflies migrate to the same remote stretch of forest in central Mexico, an event scientists have long considered a great wonder of the insect world.

(Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\nOne way to chronicle the toll of climate change is simply to list, one by one, the species that it eliminates. By one measure, that list started this year.\n\nIn February, the government of Australia recognized the first mammal to go extinct due to climate change: the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lived on an island in the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nBut the melomys, with its glassy eyes and tiny rat-like mouth, was \u2014 to the human imagination, at least \u2014 as far from the majestic monarch as a species can get. Sympathy for animals is not democratic. There\u2019s nothing logical about our love for the monarch, nothing that makes its possible extinction any more tragic than that of the melomys.\n\nBut!\n\nTo see the monarch migration arrive in central Mexico is to be transported into a waking dream. Tree branches droop under the weight of thousands of butterflies. Each morning, when the sun hits, they scatter in a glittering cloud of orange wings. In parts of the forest, looking up from the ground, visitors see more butterflies than sky, the only sound the quiet flapping of wings against the ground and leaves.\n\n\u201cThe monarch's overwintering colonies in Mexico rank as one of the great biological wonders of the world,\u201d wrote Lincoln Brower, the world\u2019s preeminent expert on the species, who died last year.\n\n[Two percent of the world\u2019s North Atlantic right whales have died in the last two months]\n\n\n\nTwo girls visiting the butterfly reserve in Rosario wear monarch wings.

A National Geographic headline celebrated their discovery by the Canadian zoologist Fred Urquhart in August 1976: \u201cDiscovered: The Monarch\u2019s Mexican Haven.\u201d\n\nYet the people of Rosario had seen the butterflies land here for centuries. It was their own private spectacle, remote enough that no Americans had located it. Pre-Hispanic pottery has been found emblazoned with images of butterflies. Across the region, soccer teams, schools and businesses are named after the monarchs.\n\n\u201cOur grandparents told us, \u2018Take care of them. They\u2019re angels,\u2019\u201d said Homero Gomez Gonz\u00e1lez, the former commissioner of Rosario.\n\nHe remembers the mid-1970s, when the American scientists started to arrive.

But now climate change poses a greater threat.\n\nSome humans are making small efforts to help the monarchs prepare climate change. Here in Rosario, the World Wildlife Fund is planting drought-resistant oyamel trees, which should be able to provide shelter to the monarchs even as temperatures rise. But experts say the effort isn\u2019t likely to change much.\n\n\u201cThe migration will disappear unless we solve climate change,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n[This Brazilian island wants to show the way to a green future.

Gen. Qasem Soleimani. (Chris Seward/AP)\n\nIran has promised severe revenge for the United States\u2019 killing of Qasem Soleimani, the country\u2019s powerful military commander. Across the Middle East, these threats of confrontation have put on high alert the bases, ports and other installations where U.S. troops are based or pass through.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon announced that it was sending an additional 3,500 troops to the region, while troops in Italy were put on standby, according to defense officials. The troop escalation came just days after President Trump ordered an additional 750 U.S. soldiers to the Middle East and 3,000 more to be on alert for future deployment, after pro-Iranian forces stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad as part of a worsening cycle of violence.\n\nTrump plunges toward the kind of Middle Eastern conflict he pledged to avoid\n\nThe United States has tens of thousands of military personnel at bases and aboard ships across the Middle East, as well as arrangements with various countries to move soldiers and military equipment through airstrips and ports. Here\u2019s a look at some of these places, which could now be targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq: Estimated 6,000 troops\n\nU.S. officials won\u2019t say exactly how many troops there are in Iraq or where they are based. There are an estimated 6,000 troops stationed across the country, including in the Green Zone, Baghdad\u2019s walled-off diplomatic area, and at al-Asad Air Base, where Vice President Pence visited U.S. troops in November.\n\nTensions are extremely high in Iraq, which is stuck in the middle of the U.S.-Iranian faceoff. That\u2019s put a spotlight on U.S. citizens and installations there: On Friday, the State Department ordered all American citizens to leave the country.\n\nThen, on Saturday, rockets were fired at the Green Zone and Balad air base, both of which have U.S. troops stationed there. No one was hurt, and such attacks aren\u2019t uncommon. Still, it\u2019s left people bracing for more \u2014 and worse.\n\nSyria: Estimated 800 troops\n\nU.S. officials are also tight-lipped about how many U.S. troops are in Syria and where. As many as 800 remain in the country after the Trump administration abruptly withdrew soldiers in October. At that time, the number was around 2,000. The U.S. garrison at Tanf, by the Syrian-Jordanian border, is now one potential flash point, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group has warned, because Iranian and Iranian-backed forces are deployed nearby.\n\nAfghanistan: Estimated 14,000 troops\n\nAfghanistan, where around 14,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed and which is in southern Asia, could become another \u201carena for U.S.-Iranian contestation,\u201d the ICG has warned. In November, Trump made a surprise visit to troops stationed at Afghanistan\u2019s Bagram air base.\n\nKuwait: About 13,000 troops\n\nThe United States has about 13,000 military personnel spread among several bases in Kuwait, according to the Congressional Research Service. The two countries have had a Defense Cooperation Agreement since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.\n\nJordan: About 3,000 troops\n\nJordan \u2014 bordering Iraq, Syria, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, as well as Saudi Arabia \u2014 is a strategically located U.S. ally. Its Muwaffaq Salti Air Base was an important launching point in the battle against the Islamic State, and there are plans to upgrade the complex. In November 2016, three U.S. soldiers were killed by a Jordanian air force sergeant in a rare shooting at King Faisal Air Base.\n\nSaudi Arabia: Estimated 3,000 troops\n\nIn October, the United States announced that it was sending additional troops to Saudi Arabia as tensions with Iran continued to build. Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been regional rivals: The two are involved in a proxy war in Yemen. Washington has accused Iran of attacking oil and gas facilities in Saudi Arabia, which Iran has denied.\n\nBahrain: More than 7,000 troops\n\nBahrain hosts a U.S. Navy base, where several thousand personnel are stationed or pass through. The island nation is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and has supported Trump\u2019s aggressive stance toward Iran. Bahrain also suppressed a Shiite uprising in 2011, putting it further at odds with Iran\u2019s government.\n\nAboard a U.S. patrol ship in the Persian Gulf, where tensions are spiking\n\nOman: About 600 hundred troops\n\nOman hosts only a few hundred troops. In March, it signed a deal allowing U.S. planes and warships to use some Omani airstrips and ports.\n\nMost important, Oman is along the Arabian Peninsula near the Strait of Hormuz, the world\u2019s most important oil choke point. It\u2019s also where the United States and Iran for months have been engaged in oil tanker standoffs: Since withdrawing from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal almost two years ago, the United States has increased pressure on Iran, including canceling waivers for countries to buy Iranian oil. Iran has in turn threatened to close access to the strait, which would severely constrain access to oil. Washington has also accused Iran of sabotaging oil tankers in the waterway, which Iran has denied.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: Up to 5,000 troops\n\nThe UAE is another country near the Strait of Hormuz that\u2019s been part of the tanker confrontations. It has hosted as many as 5,000 troops in recent years and is traditionally allied with Saudi Arabia and the United States. But rising tensions in the region have put the UAE on edge, and it has taken a somewhat more conciliatory approach to Iran in recent months.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s ambitions backfire as it finds itself on the front line of U.S.-Iranian tensions\n\nQatar: As many as 13,000 troops\n\nQatar is home to al-Udeid, the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. In 2018, Qatar announced a $1.8 billion plan to upgrade the base. The move came as Qatar was battling a blockade by rivals Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAs Trump tries to end \u2018endless wars,\u2019 America\u2019s biggest Mideast base is getting bigger\n\nTurkey: Estimated 2,500 troops\n\nTurkey hosts U.S. troops at Incirlik Air Base, as well as other sites where NATO forces are deployed.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administrations-maximum-pressure-campaign-against-iran-enters-a-new-military-phase/2020/01/04/fe237c5a-2f32-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html", "published": "2020-01-04T13:18:00", "title": "Trump\u2019s turn to military against Iran shows limits of economic \u2018maximum pressure\u2019", "text": "Neither is likely any time soon.\n\nThe sanctions have put the Iranian regime on the ropes economically, but they have not forced the Iranians to change their behavior or negotiate the deal. Instead, the campaign has pushed the fight further into the military realm, where Iran can exert its own form of maximum pressure on the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration and its defenders say the strategy has been working, and this is no time to change course.\n\nThe question now is which strategy will survive.\n\n\u201cThe entire point is to box the regime in, to make them realize that they need to settle for a suboptimal solution, otherwise the pressure will only compound,\u201d said Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n\u201cPrudent planning dictates that Washington also respond to Iran when needed, to keep it in the box. The strike against Soleimani, after six months of patience, is one such example.\u201d\n\nWashington and Tehran have been at loggerheads since the 1979 revolution and the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. But previous administrations have avoided direct confrontations and usually taken a more subtle approach. In his 2009 inauguration speech, for example, President Barack Obama promised to \u201cextend a hand\u201d if countries like Iran were willing to \u201cunclench their fists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump came to office determined to undo what he called the \u201cterrible\u201d 2015 nuclear deal the Obama administration negotiated with Iran and six other major powers.\n\nThe term \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d became common foreign policy lingo when former secretary of state Rex Tillerson started using it to describe sanctions against North Korea. The administration also has applied it to the Maduro government in Venezuela. So far, it has not made any government surrender or significantly shift its positions.\n\nBut Iran has been the target of the most maximum-pressure tactics. In one of his first speeches after taking office in 2018, Pompeo threatened Iran with the \u201ctoughest sanctions in history\u201d if it did not meet 12 demands, which included respecting human rights, withdrawing support for \u201cterrorist groups\u201d in neighboring countries and abandoning its missile development.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor a while, Iran continued to meet its commitments under the nuclear deal, even after Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018. But its tactics changed after the United States began imposing more economic punishments.\n\nThe sanctions have been brutal on Iran\u2019s economy, leading to mass protests around the country against fuel price increases. Iran\u2019s leaders have instituted a harsh crackdown, killing at least hundreds of protesters and jailing thousands, human rights groups say. But the punishing sanctions have done did little to alter Iran\u2019s actions or curb its destabilizing influence in the region.\n\nCritics of maximum-pressure sanctions say the policy has backfired.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIran isn\u2019t in a corner; we\u2019re in a corner,\u201d said Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council. \u201cTrump has no good options. What more can the U.S. do now? We\u2019ve sanctioned everything and everybody. What\u2019s left?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIran has fought back against sanctions militarily, first by attacking oil tankers, shooting down a U.S. drone and striking oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, one of its main rivals. When the administration did not respond militarily, Iran became more aggressive.\n\n\u201cIran started to ratchet up more conventional military actions to show it could not be pushed around,\u201d said John Glaser, the Cato Institute\u2019s director of Foreign Policy Studies.\n\nAD\n\nGlaser said the maximum-pressure campaign has worsened the already adversarial relationship between Washington and Tehran.\n\n\u201cTrump came into office with Iran denuclearized and with an open channel of communication in place for the first time in 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there\u2019s no diplomatic channel. They\u2019ve been imposing sanctions without signaling what Iran could do to get them lifted. Pompeo\u2019s demands were a way of saying they will never get lifted, unless they get rid of their entire foreign policy and reform their entire system. Iran saw itself with little option.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince early October, the administration has counted 10 attacks in the Baghdad area alone from militias allied with Iran. A turning point came on Dec. 27, when an American contractor was killed in a rocket attack in northern Iraq. The administration had signaled for months that it would hold Tehran responsible for the acts of militias and responded two days later with airstrikes against five of the group\u2019s facilities Iraq and Syria.\n\nAD\n\nThe conflict escalated when pro-Iran protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on New Year\u2019s Eve, prompting the strike that killed Soleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.\n\nU.S. officials show no signs of backing down from the strategy of maximum pressure and view it as a success. They say the economic devastation has put Iran\u2019s ruling clerics on their heels, ensnaring them in the worst economic and political crisis in their four decades of power as Iranians grow more fed up with the diversion of money to foreign adventures.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaximum pressure has been a successful strategy,\u201d said Fred Fleitz, who worked in the White House as chief of staff to former national security adviser John Bolton and now is president of the Center for Security Policy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put enormous pressure on the Iranian economy. The protests and attacks shows the regime\u2019s desperation. The president is giving Iran a choice. It can start negotiating, or maximum pressure will continue.\u201d\n\nBut Slavin said the Iranian government crackdown has left the opposition leaderless and turned Soleimani into a martyr.\n\nIran\u2019s leaders are \u201cprobably going to play it for everything it\u2019s worth,\u201d she said. \u201cThis regime will survive Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/at-baghdad-funeral-procession-for-qasim-soleimani-calls-for-retaliation-against-the-united-states/2020/01/04/aa02fb10-2e64-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-04T12:12:00", "title": "Trump threatens reprisals against Iran should U.S. assets or Americans come under attack", "text": "Iran immediately vowed to seek revenge for the killing of Soleimani, as the Trump administration announced that it was sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Iranian commander quoted by the Tasnim News Agency on Saturday suggested that dozens of U.S. facilities and military assets in the Middle East were at risk, along with Israel, a key U.S. ally.\n\n\u201cThirty-five vital American positions in the region are within the reach of the Islamic Republic, and Tel Aviv,\u201d the commander, Brig.

The crowds bellowed anti-American cries and vowed to fight to avenge one of Iran\u2019s heroes as U.S.-allied Iraqi security forces watched over the chanting throngs.

Iran, analysts say, has to calibrate its response \u2014 inflicting enough damage on the United States that it is seen to be avenging Soleimani\u2019s death without precipitating an all-out war.\n\nAD\n\nThe question is how?\n\nAs the Middle East braced for the answer, fearful of any misstep by either side, hints began to emerge that Tehran is in no hurry to inflict the \u201charsh revenge\u201d promised by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nEulogies for Soleimani from Iranian leaders have emphasized \u201cpatience\u201d as much as vengeance. Iranian military officials have suggested that Iran\u2019s regional proxies, rather than Iran itself, will be charged with responding.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran refuses to take any emotional and hasty action,\u201d Brig. Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, a spokesman for the armed forces, told Iran\u2019s Mehr news agency on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe will set up a plan, patiently, to respond to this terrorist act in a crushing and powerful manner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the ones who set the time and place of our reciprocal response.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlready a narrative is emerging among Iranian commentators and officials that the United States is seeking to drag Iran into a war and that Iran should not fall into the trap.\n\nBrig. Gen. Ali Fadavi told Iranian State TV that although Soleimani was the senior commander of Iran\u2019s most powerful branch of the prestigious Revolutionary Guard, it might not be Iran that strikes back.\n\n\u201cThe great front of the resistance is geographically ready to carry out this harsh revenge,\u201d he said, a reference to the wider network of Iranian proxy forces, such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, known in Iranian circles as the \u201cAxis of Resistance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat Iran has plenty of options is not in doubt. In his role as the commander of the Quds Force \u2014 the wing of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 charged with exporting Iran\u2019s revolutionary ideology \u2014 Soleimani built a network of loyalist militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen that can be called upon to shield Tehran from direct implication in attacks on U.S. or allied targets.\n\nAD\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a major attack on Saudi oil facilities in September, even though the U.S. government asserted the missile strikes were launched from Iran. In Iraq, U.S. military officials charge that the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia has been carrying out a string of rocket attacks against Iraqi military bases where U.S. troops are located, one of which killed a U.S. contractor late last month, triggering the unexpected escalation that culminated in Soleimani\u2019s killing.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump warned Iran that any strikes against \u201cAmericans or American assets\u201d will bring U.S. retaliation against 52 unspecified Iranian targets \u2014 \u201crepresenting the 52 American hostages\u201d held at the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran after Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nIn years gone by, Iranian allies have blown up American embassies and kidnapped American citizens with devastating effect, driving American troops and diplomats out of Lebanon in the 1980s and propelling the ascent of the Iranian-allied Hezbollah movement there.\n\nRiad Kahwaji, who heads the Inegma defense consultancy in Dubai, listed a range of options Iran or its allies could deploy. They include renewed attacks on Persian Gulf shipping, strikes against U.S. or allied military bases around the region, bombs at American embassies and attempts to assassinate or abduct American officials and citizens.\n\nBut it remains unclear what Iran can do that surpasses the attacks it has already carried out without provoking a bigger escalation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince May, Iran has been harassing ships and firing rockets at American troops in Iraq as part of a strategy overseen by Soleimani to punish the United States for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and imposing the harsh economic sanctions that have devastated Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nMultiple tweets by Trump deriding \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East, his abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria, and his last-minute retreat from a threat to retaliate for the downing of an American drone had all fueled confidence in Tehran that Iran could play on Trump\u2019s aversion to war by needling him with relatively small-scale attacks and perhaps weaken his resolve.\n\nBut what more can Iran do that \u201cit has not already done?\u201d Rasha al-Aqeedi, who edits the Iraqi newsletter Irfaa Sawtak, said in a tweet. \u201cKidnap foreigners? Strike military bases? Sack embassies? Assassination attempts? Target GCC oil interests? Send out militias to crackdown on adversaries?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIran is facing constraints on its room to maneuver in many of those places, said Hanin Ghaddar, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. So extensive is the reach of its influence that its allies have become integral components of the governments in Iraq and Lebanon, making Iran a target of widespread anti-government protests in recent months.\n\nMilitias backed by Soleimani have played a big part in crackdowns against the protesters in both countries, and there were videos showing celebrations by some Iraqi activists at the news of his death.\n\n\u201cIran cannot go to war in the region. In Iraq their options are becoming very limited for them because any escalation in Iraq exposes them to more attacks by the U.S.,\u201d Ghaddar said. \u201cIn Lebanon it\u2019s going to be difficult because of the financial crisis. They cannot fund a war in Lebanon or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most likely arena for an escalation is in Iraq, where the spiral of confrontation began and where Soleimani was killed, analysts say. Rockets fired Saturday into the Green Zone in Baghdad and at Balad Air Base, where U.S. troops are present, suggested Iran intends to keep up the pressure on Iraq.\n\nThe killing of Soleimani on Iraqi soil and the airstrikes last Sunday that killed 25 members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia have fueled calls for the expulsion of U.S. troops from Iraq. On Saturday, the Iraqi army said it would impose new restrictions on the 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq to help with the fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\"My sense is that we will see an escalation in Iraq,\" said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. \"But I don't think the Iranians really want a war with the U.S. I don't think they are interested in an all-out regional conflict.\"\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/03/does-president-have-consult-congress-reporters-answer-readers-questions-about-us-strike-that-killed-soleimani/", "published": "2020-01-04T08:52:57", "title": "\u2018Does the president have to consult Congress?\u2019: Reporters answer readers\u2019 questions about U.S. strike that killed Soleimani", "text": "WHO WAS SOLEIMANI?\n\nQ. What was Qasem Soleimani\u2019s impact on the fight against ISIS?\n\n\u2014 Ahmad J.\n\nA. Major. He directed Iran\u2019s irregular military efforts against the Islamic State, making him for a time an uneasy partner with U.S.-led efforts. There was never any formal alliance, of course, but the Quds Force and U.S. forces were seeking the same goal \u2014 pushing the Islamic State out of territory it had captured in Iraq and Syria. Iran has also protected Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while U.S. policy is that Assad is an illegitimate leader. \u2014 Anne Gearan\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ. Who are the members of the Quds Force? Are they local fighters or Iranian mercenaries?\n\n\u2014 Charles A.\n\nA. The Quds Force is an elite unit of fighters and operatives within the already elite Revolutionary Guard Corps. It\u2019s estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 members are tasked with carrying out missions abroad and other intelligence-gathering missions. They also support Iran\u2019s proxy militias abroad, such as Hezbollah in Iran and Shiite militias in Iran, among others. The Quds Force is made up of Iranians mainly chosen because of their skills and allegiance to the Islamic revolution. \u2014 Miriam Berger\n\nQ. Who will replace Soleimani, and what is that person\u2019s background?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 A. Hose\n\nA. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has already appointed Soleimani\u2019s deputy, Gen. Ismail Qaani, as the slain commander\u2019s replacement and vowed that the Quds Force will carry on as before. Like Soleimani, Qaani is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war of 1980 to 1988. From there, he rose in the ranks to become the deputy commander of the Quds Force. In another similarity with Soleimani, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Qaani in 2012 for his support of Iran\u2019s allies in the region. Unlike Soleimani, Qaani does not have a cultlike aura surrounding him. \u2014 M.B.\n\nAD\n\nHOW DID THE ATTACK PLAY OUT?\n\nQ. Why was Soleimani in Baghdad? Does the Iraqi government regularly countenance the presence of destabilizing elements in the country, traveling back and forth without restriction? Was he traveling as a diplomatic representative of the Iranian regime?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Dan G.\n\nA. Soleimani had flown into Baghdad for meetings, but we do not know for certain exactly what he was there to discuss. U.S. officials have claimed he was planning attacks against American troops and diplomats in Iraq. Soleimani was killed along with an Iraqi and pro-Iranian Shiite militia leader, known by the nickname Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who founded the group Kataib Hezbollah that the United States hit with airstrikes last weekend in Iraq \u2014 and whose supporters then stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq on Tuesday. It was not uncommon for Soleimani to travel to Iraq \u2014 it was basically part of his job as the commander of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, which oversees military operations abroad for the Revolutionary Guard. As part of this work, Soleimani reported directly to Khamenei and was tasked with developing and managing Iran\u2019s proxy militias and political relationships abroad. The Iraqi government, set up in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, is by design sectarian: Over the years, Soleimani has cultivated close relationships with many Shiite politicians, along with militias, in Iraq as part of Iran\u2019s regional strategy. \u2014 M.B.\n\nAD\n\nQ. What ordnance was used to carry out the attack? Was it a smart bomb launched from an aircraft? A cruise missile?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Marc B.\n\nA. A U.S. official has said the attack was carried out from an unpiloted aircraft, or drone. That would mean that one or more shorter-range missiles were fired from the air, but we do not yet know the type of missiles or how far away the drone was at the time. Presumably the drone was in Iraqi airspace. \u2014 A.G.\n\nWHY DID TRUMP APPROVE THE ATTACK? WAS IT LEGAL?\n\nQ. Was the strike necessary or was Trump trying to detract from his impeachment woes?\n\n\u2014 W. Harvey\n\nA. We can\u2019t fully assess whether the strike was necessary right now, because we don\u2019t know a great deal about the intelligence that the administration says it assessed before carrying out the strike. The administration said it was necessary because of the imminent threat of new violence directed by Soleimani. Trump may be seeking ways to distract from impeachment, but the question of whether he was justified in choosing this exact moment to kill Soleimani is murky. The attack that killed a U.S. contractor a week ago was the first event in this sequence that led to the U.S. attack early Friday, and the White House points to it in blaming Iran for starting the fight. \u2014 A.G.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ. Does the president have to consult Congress before acting against an individual or country that poses an imminent danger (i.e. actually attacking U.S. citizens), or is consultation with Congress just good management and leadership? What does the law say in these cases?\n\n\u2014 D.F.\n\nA. No, the president is not legally bound to consult with Congress when an act of national defense is deemed an emergency. Congress is given the constitutional power to declare war, but no U.S. wars have been congressionally \u201cdeclared\u201d for decades. Instead, the president is given leeway to conduct warlike actions that everyone calls a war but that Congress doesn\u2019t have to endorse with a vote. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), among others, has railed against this for years, essentially calling it a usurpation of power by the White House and an act of cowardice on the part of Congress. Past presidents have almost always found it prudent to consult with or inform at least a small group of national security leaders in Congress. \u2014 A.G.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ. Is there a consensus among military scholars that Iran can legitimately argue the Soleimani assassination is an \u201cact of war?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tim M.\n\nA. There is not consensus, but many scholars voicing opinions today about the law of warfare do categorize this an act of war. The White House says this was preventive, which is a defense against the charge that the killing violated international law. On its face, the act was a hostile one and thus potentially warlike: A foreign government figure was targeted off the battlefield. The Trump administration will probably argue that Soleimani was indeed \u201con the battlefield,\u201d because he was arriving in Iraq from Syria and, they claim, planning new attacks in U.S. interests. \u2014 A.G.\n\nAD\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nQ. How would the military capabilities of Iran now compare with those of Iraq, pre-invasion? In recent history, are there any examples of the United States taking similar actions against an agent of a country that has a military with similar capabilities to those of Iran?\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Ryan S.\n\nA. Iran has the second-best military in the Middle East. The best is Israel\u2019s, and not by coincidence. Iran is wealthy despite U.S. sanctions and has an effective, multilayered military system with regular and irregular forces, plus proxy militias in several countries or territories. Iran\u2019s military is generally considered to be much better than it was before the eight-year Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and more modern and disciplined than Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi forces in 2003. Trump has said Iran should not try to start a war, because it would lose quickly, but there is little doubt that Iran could do a great deal of damage to U.S. forces or allies. As to U.S. examples, I can\u2019t think of any. The United States has carried out targeted killings of individual terrorist leaders, but those were not government officials. It\u2019s worth noting that the United States did engineer the overthrow of Iran\u2019s elected prime minister in 1953, though it didn\u2019t kill him. \u2014 A.G."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-war-weary-baghdad-fears-that-us-and-iran-showdowns-could-leave-iraq-caught-in-the-middle/2020/01/04/6378f87a-2f09-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html", "published": "2020-01-04T08:42:00", "title": "In Baghdad, fears that U.S.-Iran showdowns could leave Iraq caught in middle", "text": "The attack has shaken Iraq, sharpening long-standing fears that the country\u2019s soil will become home, again, for a bloody shadow war between Washington and Tehran.

(Australian Maritime Safety Authority/Reuters)\n\nAs southeast Australia burned Saturday, the word carried on the wind was \"unprecedented.\" The continent has seen massive wildfire outbreaks before, but this one has been different. There are so many fires in so many places \u2014 about 200 at last count \u2014 and many are in novel terrain, including rainforests and the suburbs of Sydney.\n\nThe flames have taken the lives of a dozen people in the past week, killed untold numbers of koalas and other animals, destroyed more than a thousand structures, forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate, choked cities with smoke and rendered the famed Sydney Opera House nearly invisible on the city\u2019s harbor. The smoke has reached the lower stratosphere and crossed 9,000 miles of ocean to pollute the skies of South America.\n\nSaturday was one of the worst days yet in a stretch of dangerous fire weather \u2014 blazing heat, parched brush and winds that topped 60 miles per hour. It was the hottest day on record in metropolitan Sydney, with the town of Penrith hitting 120 degrees, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

But the chief firefighter in New South Wales, Shane Fitzsimmons, complained Sunday that he didn\u2019t know about the deployment until he saw the news on TV. He said he called the prime minister\u2019s office for details.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that on one of our worst days this season, to hear that announcement, then have to try to work through on top of everything else what it means and how it is going to operate,\u201d he said in a television interview.\n\nRoads have closed, and many residents and summer vacationers have been trapped in coastal towns and told to flee the flames by boat if there is no other option.

This season\u2019s fires have burned through an area at least the size of West Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Sanctuary Point, a normally bustling vacation town, 13 of the 18 shops on the main street were closed Saturday. Shopkeepers said the staff and owners had either left town or were preparing to defend their houses. Those who remained waited anxiously for a southerly change that could whip up the fire, and they kept watch for embers, which fire officials have said can ignite trees, leaves and grass up to seven miles ahead of a fire front.\n\nAround midday, Helen Bowerman was pouring water into the guttering on her concrete-block and metal-roof house. With the air smelling of smoke, the 66-year-old said she was worried that tall trees on an adjacent property could catch fire and collapse.\n\nShould the fire reach her, Bowerman said, she planned to dive into a large estuary next to her house. A neighbor had kayaks ready to go. \u201cWe all look out for each other and help each other out,\u201d she said.\n\nFarrugia Sammut, 82, said she had not been as scared since her childhood home in Malta was bombed during World War II. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded\u201d by wildfires, the former factory worker said. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night for the worry.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Houses were exploding\u2019: In Australia\u2019s fire horror, heartbreak and relief]\n\n\n\nFirefighters drag a hose after putting out a blaze near Moruya in New South Wales, Australia, on Saturday. (Rick Rycroft/AP)\n\nOn Sunday, the Aussies got a break meteorologically. The cold front that blasted through Saturday brought more comfortable temperatures and the promise of a few calmer days.\n\nBut that same cold front had also delivered high winds through Saturday night, creating fresh emergencies as it pushed the conflagrations northward into new terrain. Four firefighters were injured overnight \u2014 three from smoke inhalation and a fourth from burns to his hands. Hundreds more houses had been destroyed, according to a fire brigade spokesman.\n\nDespite the improved conditions, fire authorities said it wasn\u2019t safe for people in many coastal towns to leave by road. The main highway south from Sydney to the coast was cut off by flames and smoke overnight in several locations. The highway linking Sydney and Melbourne \u2014 Australia\u2019s two largest cities \u2014 was also closed.\n\nMore than 1,000 people spent the night at an emergency shelter in Bega, a town in southern New South Wales surrounded by national parks, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nThis past year was the hottest on record in Australia \u2014 and also the driest. The lethal combination has underwritten a fire season that started early, in September, and shows no sign of abating. The death toll since the fire season began stands at 23. The fires are so extreme that the weather bureau has warned of lightning strikes from what are called pyro-cumulonimbus clouds \u2014 fire-spawned thunderheads built of smoke, towering to 45,000 feet and generating ground-level convection that makes firefighting harder.\n\nForecasters do not anticipate any significant rain in the scorched regions for months.\n\n[On land, Australia\u2019s rising heat is \u2018apocalyptic.\u2019 In the ocean, it\u2019s worse.]\n\nThis natural disaster is also a political flash point. The fires are a vivid signal of the global crisis of climate change, which can make ecological conditions more suitable to the ignition and intensification of wildfires. Climate change has been a divisive topic in Australia for years, a wedge issue that has decided elections.\n\nIn the past, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has downplayed the importance of tackling climate change and has offered full-throated support for coal mining. The fires have created the biggest test of that position, and of Morrison\u2019s leadership, since his conservatives unexpectedly won a general election in May.\n\nEven on a dry continent accustomed to fatal wildfires, footage of hundreds of civilians being evacuated by sea triggered a sense among many Australians that climate change poses an immediate threat to the nation, one of the world\u2019s largest coal exporters. Three weeks ago, the country recorded its highest nationally averaged temperatures \u2014 twice in two days.\n\nAlready, the devastation has fueled calls for Morrison \u2014 who once brandished a lump of coal in Parliament to underline his support for mining \u2014 to take more concerted action on climate change. Australia\u2019s share of global carbon dioxide emissions from domestic use of fossil fuels is about 1.4 percent, according to Climate Analytics, but the country is one of the highest emitters per capita.\n\n\u201cThe best response I can provide to people who are feeling angry and isolated, people who are feeling afraid, is what I can do today,\u201d Morrison said at a news briefing in Canberra, flanked by the minister of defense and the chief of the defense forces. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take action on climate change.\u201d\n\n[Australia\u2019s prime minister visited families devastated by the wildfires. It did not go well.]\n\n\n\nSmoke covers the skyline as fires approach the Princes Highway at Bodalla in New South Wales on Saturday. (Brett Hemmings/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe fires have also undermined Morrison\u2019s reputation as a man in touch with middle Australia.\n\nThe prime minister, who was snubbed and heckled by exhausted and angry firefighters and survivors in recent days, ordered what the government said was the first major use of military reserves to respond to this type of natural disaster. He also touted, in a promotional video, an Australian navy ship that has been ordered to the border between the states of New South Wales and Victoria to help evacuate people.\n\nThese moves followed criticism of Morrison\u2019s decision to vacation in Hawaii after the fires began, and there is a perception that state-based firefighting services have been overwhelmed by blazes that have destroyed more than 1,300 homes.\n\n\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d said Geoff Monkhouse, a 76-year-old retired electrical contractor who was drinking beer at a Sanctuary Point country club on Saturday. \u201cHe should not go smiling around people that are suffering.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s deadliest wildfire disaster was in February 2009, when 173 people were killed.\n\nOn Saturday, Andrew Constance, a conservative lawmaker from southern New South Wales, compared the fires in his region to \u201can atomic bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable the hell it\u2019s caused and the devastation it\u2019s caused,\u201d he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.\n\nConditions beginning to deteriorate quickly on #NSW southern firegrounds. #Heat & #Wind are building which is increasing fire activity.

His listeners told tales of retching as they drove around the city. The fires are right up against the Sydney suburbs, an unfamiliar experience for residents.\n\nIn an email, Glover described the nature of the disaster, with office workers wearing breathing masks and senior citizens pressing hankies to their mouths as they walk the streets:\n\n\u201cThere are the unprecedented fish deaths in our inland rivers; the unprecedented level-one fire warning for Sydney; the unprecedented day of blazes in every state and territory.\u201d\n\nHe summed up the mood: \u201cGnawing anxiety is everywhere, together with enormous gratitude and admiration for the \u2018thin yellow line\u2019 of volunteer fire-fighters who are standing in the way of the flames.\u201d\n\n1 of 32 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 In photos: Australia sees worst wildfires in decades View Photos Thousands flee coastal towns as the fires close in.

Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was a larger-than-life figure and deft architect of Iran\u2019s success in building loyal proxy forces in the Middle East. It is a network that Tehran used to help defeat the Islamic State and to project military and political power in places such as Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the bespectacled Qaani \u2014 whose portfolio as deputy included Quds Force operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asian republics \u2014 boasts few notable military victories. Instead, experts say, he is believed to have focused on the organization\u2019s day-to-day administrative affairs.\n\n\u201cQaani\u2019s war-era record does not display the same degree of distinction as Soleimani\u2019s,\u201d said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington and author of \u201cIran Unveiled: How the Revolutionary Guards are Transforming Iran from Theocracy Into Military Dictatorship.\u201d\n\nArash Azizi, a New York-based writer who is researching a forthcoming book on Iran\u2019s external military operations, said: \u201cQaani was presumed to be the heir apparent for a long time. But he\u2019s very bureaucratic \u2014 he does not have Soleimani\u2019s charisma.\n\n\u201cAs someone who works in Iran\u2019s national security apparatus, he hasn\u2019t really distinguished himself,\u201d Azizi said.\n\nWhat the obscure new commander brings, however, is continuity in the face of an extraordinary blow to the Quds Force\u2019s leadership, analysts say. As deputy commander, a position he assumed in the late 1990s or early 2000s, according to reports, he possesses intimate knowledge of the force\u2019s inner workings and covert activities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUnder Qaani\u2019s leadership, there is likely to be greater continuity than change in the Quds Force,\u201d Alfoneh said.\n\n\u201cI suspect he\u2019ll have little difficulty filling Soleimani\u2019s shoes when it comes to operations and strategy,\u201d said Afshon Ostovar, author of \u201cVanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards.\u201d\n\nQaani first joined the Revolutionary Guard as a young man in 1980, when it was a nascent force tasked with protecting the Islamic Republic. He soon became division commander, leading battles in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and oversaw operations in northeastern Iran, where he was born.\n\nThere, according to Alfoneh, Qaani likely helped facilitate support for Afghanistan\u2019s Northern Alliance, a group of fighters that sought to overthrow the Taliban, a Sunni militant movement that came to power in 1996.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1998, when Taliban forces attacked Iran\u2019s consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, killing nine diplomats, Qaani was instrumental in dissuading Tehran\u2019s leadership from responding militarily, Azizi said.\n\n\u201cMany people were eager for Iran to take action,\u201d Azizi said. \u201cIt was an act of maturity on Qaani\u2019s part in deciding not do anything rash.\u201d\n\nQaani and his predecessor appear to have divided the labor: Soleimani operated on Iran\u2019s western front, while Qaani\u2019s focus remained on its eastern borders.\n\nQaani also once traveled with Iran\u2019s then-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to several countries in Africa and South America. In 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Qaani for overseeing the distribution of Quds Force funding to regional allies. He also was responsible for a weapons shipment to Gambia that was intercepted in Nigeria in 2010, the department said.\n\nHe is also believed to have to have played a prominent role in establishing Liwa al-Fatemiyoun, a military brigade of mostly Afghan Shiite Hazaras who were deployed to Syria to assist government forces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2012, Qaani was the first Revolutionary Guard commander to publicly acknowledge Iran\u2019s military presence in Syria, telling an Iranian news outlet that because of Iran\u2019s involvement in the war, \u201cbig massacres were prevented.\u201d\n\n\u201cQaani seems to be a more cagey personality than his predecessor,\u201d Ostovar said. \u201cBut like Soleimani, Qaani seems to have a strong personal relationship with the supreme leader.\u201d\n\nQaani\u2019s decades-long career at the highest levels of the Revolutionary Guard \u201csays a lot about the trust both Khamenei and Soleimani had in him,\u201d Ostovar said.\n\nStill, experts say, Qaani lacks broader experience in the Arab world, an area crucial to Iran\u2019s efforts to counter U.S. and Israeli military power.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that he speaks Arabic, and he doesn\u2019t have the same understanding of the Arab world or of Israel that Soleimani had,\u201d said Azizi.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Ostovar, \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that Qaani\u2019s friendships with proxy commanders are as well-developed or run as deep as Soleimani\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he will \u201cprobably run operations primarily from a distance,\u201d Ostovar said. \u201cEven if he wanted to replicate Soleimani\u2019s general-on-the-front-lines photo ops, it\u2019ll be difficult for him to do now.\u201d\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/04/why-qasem-soleimanis-body-is-being-brought-iraqi-cities-najaf-karbala/", "published": "2020-01-04T15:13:34", "title": "Why Qasem Soleimani\u2019s body is being brought to the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala", "text": "The killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani: What you need to read\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know to understand what this moment means in U.S.-Iran relations.\n\nWhat happened: President Trump ordered a drone strike near the Baghdad airport, killing Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, one of Iran\u2019s top military figures and leader of its special-operations forces abroad.\n\nWho Soleimani was: As the leader of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 elite Quds Force, Soleimani was key in training Iran\u2019s allies across the region, especially in Iraq. Soleimani\u2019s influence was imprinted on various Shiite militias that fought U.S. troops.\n\nHow we got here: Tensions had been escalating between Iran and the United States since Trump pulled out of an Obama-era nuclear deal and spiked shortly before the airstrike. On Tuesday, supporters of an Iranian-backed militia, Kataib Hezbollah, breached the gates of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, demanding that U.S. troops and diplomats leave the country. The militia supporters were protesting the killing of 25 fighters in U.S. airstrikes. The strikes were carried out in response to the death of a U.S. contractor in a rocket attack against a military base in Kirkuk that the United States blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWhat happens next: Soleimani\u2019s killing could be a catalyst for greater violence, experts warned. Iran vowed \u201csevere revenge\u201d in response, while U.S. outposts braced for retaliatory attacks and oil prices rose. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq warned U.S. citizens to leave \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nWant to understand world news better?

Should enough of them abandon Guaid\u00f3 on Sunday, the Washington-backed 36-year-old would no longer be able to defend his presidential claim as being rooted in the Venezuelan constitution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would create an international disruption and put us in a very critical situation,\u201d said Luis Stefanelli, a Venezuelan lawmaker now living in exile in the United States. \u201cWe need Guaid\u00f3 there. The government knows it.\u201d\n\nDiscovery of the alleged plot last month, Guaid\u00f3 loyalists say, has helped them to counter it. And they are cautiously optimistic about Guaid\u00f3\u2019s reelection. In an effort designed to enhance his chances, U.S. officials in recent weeks have privately reiterated their support of Guaid\u00f3 to major players within the Venezuelan opposition, according to three people familiar with the effort.\n\nIn addition, opposition officials have authorized pro-Guaid\u00f3 lawmakers in exile to vote remotely on Sunday, ensuring a larger pool of votes and avoiding the use of stand-ins who some fear may have been bought off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe math appears to be in Guaid\u00f3\u2019s favor. Opposition parties make up more than 60 percent of the assembly and Guaid\u00f3 needs a simple majority to be reelected as head of the body. Pollsters predict he is likely to muster the votes he needs, and no one is running against him.\n\nYet the risk remains, observers say, that he may not secure enough votes. The assembly includes more than 40 pro-Maduro lawmakers, and at least seven more who belong to small parties that have turned against Guaid\u00f3. They blame him for a range of wrongs: overpromising on how quickly Maduro could be ousted, backing painful U.S. sanctions, and agreeing to sit in doomed negotiations with Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nWhat worries Guaid\u00f3 backers most, however, are revelations that more than a dozen lawmakers may have accepted bribes in an alleged plot that the opposition has dubbed \u201cOperation Scorpion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast month, the heads of the Inclusive Democratic Movement (MDI) disclosed that one of its lawmakers, Kelly Perfecto, had confessed to taking a 50,000-euro bribe. She told the heads of her party that she and 13 other opposition lawmakers had secretly met on Nov. 27 with Maduro, his wife, Cilia Flores, and two other major government figures \u2014 Diosdado Cabello and Tareck El Aissami. In the meeting, Perfecto claimed, the 14 of them agreed to vote against Guaid\u00f3 in exchange for cash, according to MDI chief Nicmer Evans.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Evans said the lawmakers were promised a total of 1 million euros before the vote. The plan, he said, also involved creating a new party that would later field a candidate to replace Guaid\u00f3 as head of the assembly. Perfecto has been ejected from the party, he said.\n\nPerfecto did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is simple,\u201d Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special envoy to Venezuela, told reporters in Washington two weeks ago. \u201cThe National Assembly will vote on January 5, and the regime is using a combination of threats, arrests, and bribes \u2014 up to $500,000 per vote, we have been told \u2014 to stop the reelection of Juan Guaid\u00f3.\u201d\n\nTo thwart Guaid\u00f3, Maduro\u2019s government would need to enlist 30 lawmakers, or slightly fewer if the overall pool of lawmakers is smaller.\n\nTo improve Guaid\u00f3\u2019s chances, the National Assembly passed a law last month that allows more than 20 lawmakers driven into exile by Maduro\u2019s government to vote remotely. Some opposition leaders, however, fear that Maduro\u2019s government may seek to block communication links on Sunday, and perhaps even stop lawmakers from interior cities from traveling to the session in Caracas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a new opportunity [for Maduro] to take control of\u201d the National Assembly, said Felix Seijas, political analyst and director of the Delphos polling agency. \u201cThe people are tired. The international community is tired. If Guaid\u00f3 loses, his whole movement would end up down the river.\u201d\n\nYet even if Guaid\u00f3 is reelected, his movement still faces difficult challenges at time when Venezuela remains trapped in one of the worst economic implosions of modern times. Opposition parties are holding intense meetings to draft new strategies after underestimating Maduro\u2019s ability to hold on to power, and failing to establish enough support within the military to prompt it to switch allegiance.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t end the year with the results we and the country wanted,\u201d said Miguel Pizarro, an exiled lawmaker who is close to Guaid\u00f3. \u201cTo keep acting as if everything is okay is not the right strategy and is not realistic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to people close to Guaid\u00f3, his team is moving toward a plan that would seek to increase pressure on Maduro domestically while also positioning Guaid\u00f3 as more of a \u201creal president.\u201d He may also seek to distribute more food and medicine to needy Venezuelans and create a new cabinet that includes professionals outside of traditional opposition parties.\n\nYet corruption scandals within the opposition are hindering efforts to revive the movement, and opposition leaders remain divided on key strategy points.\n\nMaduro appears poised to call new elections for the National Assembly later this year, and opposition leaders are split on whether to participate. Some argue in favor of a boycott, given past allegations of election fraud under Maduro. Others have said they would participate only if the election is part of a negotiated deal that also includes a presidential vote to replace Maduro.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill others say the opposition must field candidates either way, arguing that a boycott could mean losing any chance of maintaining opposition control of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe have to correct, improve, redouble efforts, and be loyal to one idea, to make 2020 the definitive year,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said in a video posted on Twitter this week.\n\nFaiola reported from Miami.\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/mudslides-blackouts-hamper-search-after-indonesia-floods/2020/01/05/39baf062-3024-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html", "published": "2020-01-05T13:31:14", "title": "Mudslides, blackouts hamper search after Indonesia floods", "text": "It\u2019s the worst flooding in the area since 2007, when 80 people were killed over 10 days.

But the rain was also making it challenging for fire crews to complete strategic burns as they tried to prepare for higher temperatures that have been forecast for later in the week.\n\n\u201cWith the more benign weather conditions it presents some wonderful relief for everybody, the firefighters, the emergency services personnel, but also the communities affected by these fires,\u201d Shane Fitzsimmons, commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told reporters. \u201cBut it also presents some real challenges when it comes to implementing tactical and strategic back-burns and other techniques to try and bring these fires under control.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMore than 135 fires were still burning across New South Wales, including almost 70 that were not contained. Officials have warned that the rain won\u2019t put out the largest and most dangerous blazes before conditions deteriorate again.\n\nAD\n\nVictoria state Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said at least 200 millimeters (8 inches) of rain would need to fall over a short period of time in order to snuff out the fires \u2014 around 20 times what has fallen across the region in the past day. And officials warned that the country\u2019s wildfire season \u2014 which generally lasts through March \u2014 was nowhere near its end.\n\n\u201cNo one can be complacent. We\u2019ve got big fire danger coming our way toward the end of this week,\u201d Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne. \u201cWe are by no means out of this. And the next few days, and indeed the next few months, are going to be challenging.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian also urged Australians not to let their guards down.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, overnight, it\u2019s become apparent that we have two people unaccounted for in New South Wales,\u201d she said at a news conference, adding she still held out hope for some good news to emerge about them.\n\nAD\n\nAustralia\u2019s capital, Canberra, had the worst air quality of any major city in the world on Monday. The Department of Home Affairs, which is responsible for coordinating the country\u2019s response to disasters, told all non-critical staff to stay home because of thick smoke choking the city.\n\nThe prime minister said the military was attempting to get food, fuel and water to burned-out communities, and engineers were working to reopen roads and resupply evacuation centers. On Kangaroo Island, a refuge off the coast of South Australia for some of the country\u2019s most endangered creatures, teams had arrived to help euthanize livestock and wild animals injured in the blazes. Hundreds of millions of animals are believed to have died already in the fires across the country.\n\nAD\n\nHeavy smoke, meanwhile, was hampering the navy\u2019s efforts to airlift people out of Mallacoota, a coastal town in Victoria cut off for days by fires that forced as many as 4,000 residents and tourists to shelter on beaches over the weekend. Around 300 people were still waiting to be evacuated on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s announcement of relief funds comes as he finds himself under siege for what many Australians have viewed as his lax response to the crisis. On Saturday, he announced he would dispatch 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists to help battle the fires and committed 20 million Australian dollars ($14 million) to lease firefighting aircraft from overseas.\n\nBut the moves did little to tamp down the criticism that he had been slow to act, even as he has downplayed the need for his government to address climate change, which experts say helps supercharge the blazes.\n\nAD\n\nWildfires are common during the southern hemisphere summer, and Australians generally take a pragmatic view of them. But this year\u2019s fires arrived unusually early, fed by drought and the country\u2019s hottest and driest year on record.\n\nAD\n\nScientists say there\u2019s no doubt man-made global warming has played a major role in feeding the fires, along with factors like very dry brush and trees and strong winds.\n\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace said the relief funds announced by Morrison were \u201ca drop in the ocean,\u201d given the widespread devastation from the fires.\n\n\u201cEvery single cent of that money should be contributed by the coal, gas and oil companies whose carbon pollution has caused the climate crisis that has created these extreme fire conditions, right across the country,\u201d Greenpeace Australia Pacific Head of Campaigns Jamie Hanson said in a statement. \u201cSlugging everyday taxpayers with the bill for this just adds insult to injury. These big polluters have become rich by trashing our climate and it\u2019s time that they started coughing up for the repair bill.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Khamenei, who had a close relationship with Soleimani, Khamenei wept at one point during the traditional Muslim prayers for the dead. The crowd and others wailed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGhaani stood near Khamenei\u2019s side, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other top leaders in the Islamic Republic. While Iran recently faced nationwide protests over government-set gasoline prices that reportedly killed over 300 people, Soleimani\u2019s mass processionals has seen politicians and leaders across the Islamic Republic\u2019s political spectrum take part, temporarily silencing that anger.\n\nGhaani meanwhile made his threat in an interview with Iranian state television aired Monday. \u201cGod the almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger. Certainly actions will be taken,\u201d he said.\n\nGhaani now serves as the head of the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s Quds Force, an expeditionary arm of the paramilitary organization answerable only to Khamenei. As Soleimani\u2019s longtime deputy, Ghaani has been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2012 for his work funding its operations around the world, including its work with proxies in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose proxies likely will be involved in any operation targeting U.S. interests in the Mideast or elsewhere in the world.\n\nAlready, the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia warned Americans \u201cof the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks.\u201d In Lebanon, the leader of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah said Soleimani\u2019s killing made U.S. military bases, warships and service members across the region fair game for attacks. A former Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader suggested the Israeli city of Haifa and others could be targeted should the U.S. attack Iran.\n\n\u201cWe promise to continue down martyr Soleimani\u2019s path as firmly as before with help of God, and in return for his martyrdom we aim to get rid of America from the region,\u201d Ghaani said.\n\nAD\n\nOn the nuclear deal, Iranian state television cited Sunday a statement by President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s administration saying the country would not observe the nuclear deal\u2019s restrictions on fuel enrichment, on the size of its enriched uranium stockpile and on its research and development activities.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran no longer faces any limitations in operations,\u201d a state TV broadcaster said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson specifically urged Iran to \u201cwithdraw all measures\u201d not in line with the 2015 agreement that was intended to stop Tehran from pursuing its atomic weapons program.\n\nAD\n\nIran insisted that it remains open to negotiations with European partners over its nuclear program. And it did not back off from earlier promises that it wouldn\u2019t seek a nuclear weapon.\n\nHowever, the announcement represents the clearest nuclear proliferation threat yet made by Iran since Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. It further raises regional tensions, as Iran\u2019s longtime foe Israel has promised never to allow Iran to produce an atomic bomb.\n\nAD\n\nIran did not elaborate on what levels it would immediately reach in its program.Tehran has already broken some of the deal\u2019s limits as part of a step-by-step pressure campaign to get sanctions relief. It already has increased its production, begun enriching uranium to 5% and restarted enrichment at an underground facility.\n\nAD\n\nWhile it does not possess uranium enriched to weapons-grade levels of 90%, any push forward narrows the estimated one-year \u201cbreakout time\u201d needed for it to have enough material to build a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations watchdog observing Iran\u2019s program, did not respond to a request for comment. However, Iran said that its cooperation with the IAEA \u201cwill continue as before.\u201d\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi earlier told journalists that Soleimani\u2019s killing would prompt Iranian officials to take a bigger step away from the nuclear deal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the world of politics, all developments are interconnected,\u201d Mousavi said.\n\nAD\n\nSoleimani\u2019s killing has escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of back-and-forth attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. Iran has promised \u201charsh revenge\u201d for the U.S. attack, while Trump has vowed on Twitter that the U.S. will strike back at 52 targets \u201cVERY FAST AND VERY HARD. \u201d\n\nHe doubled down on that threat Sunday, dismissing warnings that targeting cultural sites could be a war crime under international law.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re allowed to kill our people. They\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of thousands of mourners accompanied the coffin carrying Soleimani\u2019s remains in the Iranian cities of Ahvaz and Mashhad. A similar procession was expected in Qom and Tehran on Monday. Tens of thousands already filled the streets of the Iranian capital early Monday morning.\n\nAD\n\nMourners wearing black beat their chests and carried posters with Soleimani\u2019s portrait. Demonstrators also unfurled red Shiite flags, which traditionally symbolize both the spilled blood of someone unjustly killed and a call for vengeance.\n\nThe processions mark the first time Iran honored a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic Republic, received such a processional with his death in 1989. Soleimani on Monday will lie in state at Tehran\u2019s famed Musalla mosque as the revolutionary leader did before him.\n\nHe will be buried in his hometown of Kerman.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds force. Iran has vowed to retaliate and Iraq\u2019s parliament responded by voting Sunday to oust U.S. troops based in the country.\n\nTrump first raised the prospect of targeting Iranian cultural sites Saturday in a tweet. Speaking with reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington from his holiday stay in Florida, he doubled down, despite international prohibitions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re allowed to kill our people. They\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe targeted killing of Soleimani sparked outrage in the Middle East, including in Iraq, where more than 5,000 American troops are still on the ground 17 years after the U.S. invasion. Iraq\u2019s parliament voted Sunday in favor of a nonbinding resolution calling for the expulsion of the American forces.\n\nTrump said the U.S. wouldn\u2019t leave without being paid for its military investments in Iraq over the years \u2014 then said if the troops do have to withdraw, he would hit Baghdad with economic penalties.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe will charge them sanctions like they\u2019ve never seen before ever. It\u2019ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving until they pay us back for it.\u201d\n\nThe administration has scrambled to contend with the backlash to the killing of Soleimani. Though he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, the targeted American strike marked a stark escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. military may well strike more Iranian leaders if the Islamic Republic retaliates. He tip-toed around questions about Trump\u2019s threat to attack Iranian cultural sites, a military action that likely would be illegal under the laws of armed conflict and the U.N. charter.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo said only that any U.S. military strikes inside Iran would be legal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll behave inside the system,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe always have and we always will.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s warnings rattled some administration officials. One U.S. national security official said the president had caught many in the administration off guard and prompted internal calls for others in the government, including Pompeo, to clarify the matter. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly to the issue, said clarification was necessary to affirm that the U.S. military would not intentionally commit war crimes.\n\nAD\n\nOona Hathaway, an international law professor at Yale and a former national security law official in the Defense Department\u2019s legal office, said Trump\u2019s threat amounted to \u201ca pretty clear promise of commission of a war crime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president\u2019s threats to Iran did little to quell Tehran\u2019s furor over the death of Soleimani. Iranian state television reported that the country would no longer abide by any limits of the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with the United States and other world powers. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018 and stepped up economic sanctions on Tehran \u2014 actions that accelerated a cycle of hostilities leading to the last week\u2019s killing.\n\nThe administration also pushed back Sunday on questions about the legality of the strike on Soleimani. Pompeo said the administration would have been \u201cculpably negligent\u201d in its duty to protect the United States if it had not killed him. He did not provide evidence for his previous claims that Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on Americans. Instead of arguing that an attack had been imminent, he said it was inevitable.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe watched him continue to actively build out for what was going to be a significant attack \u2013 that\u2019s what we believed \u2013 and we made the right decision,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cWe continue to prepare for whatever it is the Iranian regime may put in front of us within the next 10 minutes, within the next 10 days, and within the next 10 weeks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCongressional Democrats were skeptical.\n\n\u201cI really worry that the actions the president took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the Middle East. He promised we wouldn\u2019t have that,\u201d said Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat.\n\nSchumer said Trump lacks the authority to engage militarily with Iran and Congress needs a new war powers resolution \u201cto be a check on this president.\u201d To which Pompeo said: \u201cWe have all the authority we need to do what we\u2019ve done to date.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said the administration violated the Constitution by not consulting with Congress in advance.\n\nCongressional staffs got their first briefings from the administration on Friday, and members were expected to be briefed this week.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump made clear Sunday that he saw little reason to give Congress advanced warning if he orders the military to carry out further actions against Iran.\n\n\u201cThese Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cSuch legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!\u201d\n\nDemocrats in Congress have complained that Trump\u2019s order to kill Soleimani took place without first consulting with or informing top lawmakers, noting that Congress still holds sole power to declare war. Trump did meet the 48-hour deadline required by the War Powers Act to notify Congress of the deadly drone strike, though the document provided Saturday was entirely classified and no public version was released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoving swiftly to rebuke Trump for not consulting with Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late Sunday the House would introduce and vote this week on a war powers resolution to limit the president\u2019s military actions regarding Iran. In a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi called the airstrike \u201cprovocative and disproportionate\u201d and that it had \u201cendangered our servicemembers, diplomats and others by risking a serious escalation of tensions with Iran.\u201d A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate.\n\nSome of the Democrats running to challenge Trump in November questioned whether he had a long-term plan for the Mideast.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said Trump was ill-prepared for the repercussions of the strike on Soleimani and had alienated allies by not alerting them of the plans. \u201cI think we need a president who could provide steady leadership on Day One,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next president is going to inherit a divided nation and a world in disarray.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with the Middle East, you need to think about the next and the next and the next move. This is not checkers. And I\u2019m not sure any of us really believe that this president and the people around him\u2019\u2019 are \u201creally going through all of the consequences of what could happen next.\u201d\n\nPompeo appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d\u2019 CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u2019\u2019 \u201dFox News Sunday\u201d and Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d Schumer was on ABC, Warner was on NBC and Buttigieg was on CNN.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Similarly, it remains unclear how many from a unique flock of glossy black-cockatoos got away from the flames and whether they have a future on an island where much of their habitat has gone up in smoke.\n\nLocated off the coast of South Australia state, Kangaroo Island is about 50% larger than Rhode Island and home to 4,500 people and what was a thriving ecotourism industry. But the wildfires that have been ravaging swaths of Australia have burned through one-third of the island, killing a father and his son and leaving behind a scorched wasteland and a devastated community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey also have left people scrambling to help the critters that have survived.\n\n\u201cCaring for all these animals is quite amazing,\u201d said Sam Mitchell, co-owner of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park. \u201cHowever, we are seeing a lot that are too far gone. We are seeing kangaroos and koalas with their hands burned off \u2014 they stand no chance. It\u2019s been quite emotional.\u201d\n\nInspired in part by the late Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin, Mitchell and his wife, Dana, bought the commercial park seven years ago in their early 20s, and have been renovating the place and taking in rescue animals since.\n\nOn Friday night with the fire approaching, Dana fled with their 18-month-old son, Connor, while Sam stayed behind to defend the park and their dream. A wind change spared the park from the wildfire\u2019s path.\n\nAD\n\nMitchell said the fires have killed thousands of koalas on the island, a particularly devastating loss because the creatures have remained largely disease-free there, while many koalas on mainland Australia suffer from chlamydia.\n\nAD\n\nThe couple are currently caring for about 18 burned koalas, and they\u2019ve had to euthanize many more.\n\nMeanwhile, Heidi Groffen could do nothing, as all eight monitoring stations she and her partner had set up to keep track of the mysterious Kangaroo Island dunnart, the mouse-like marsupial, melted in the flames.\n\nAn ecologist and coordinator for the nonprofit Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife, Groffen said the population of 300 or so dunnarts may have been wiped out altogether because they are too small to outrun wildfires, although she remains hopeful that some may have sheltered in rock crevices.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven if there are survivors, there is no food for them now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring some into captivity before they are completely gone.\u201d\n\nShe said the creatures have long fascinated her because so little is known about them.\n\nAD\n\nAlso uncertain is the future for the 400 or so Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoos. Once prevalent on the South Australia mainland, the birds retreated to the island after humans destroyed much of their traditional habitat.\n\n\u201cUnlike some of the other animals, the birds are in the best position to escape. They can get away from the fires a bit more,\u201d said Daniella Teixeira, who is working on a doctoral degree about the birds at The University of Queensland.\n\nAD\n\nBut much like the dunnarts, the cockatoos could find they don\u2019t have enough food left on the island, particularly because they eat only from a single type of tree known as a drooping she-oak. And many hot spots on the island continue to burn.\n\nTeixeira said careful conservation work over the past 25 years has seen the glossy black-cockatoo population increase from 150, but those gains have been wiped out in the space of a week.\n\nShe said she is currently writing the final chapter of the thesis she began in 2016, but that suddenly everything has changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to sit here and write a paper on them when I don\u2019t know their status today,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
