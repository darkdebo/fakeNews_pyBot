President Trump has threatened severe sanctions against Iraq after its parliament called on US troops to leave the country.

""We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,"" he told reporters.

Tensions are high after the US assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad last week.

Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"".

Soleimani, 62, spearheaded Iranian military operations in the Middle East, and was regarded as a terrorist by the US.

The general's remains have now returned to his home country, where mourners packed the streets of Tehran early on Monday.

The new head of Iran's Quds force - which Soleimani led - has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East.

""We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region,"" state radio quoted Esmail Qaani as saying.

The strike that killed Soleimani also claimed the life of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a top Iraqi military figure who commanded the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group.

What did Trump threaten Iraq with?

Speaking from the presidential plane, Mr Trump said that if Iraq asked US forces to depart on an unfriendly basis, ""we will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before, ever. It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.""

Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group.

On Sunday, the coalition paused its operations against IS in Iraq, and Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave.

The resolution was pushed through by the parliament's Shia Muslim bloc - which is close to Iran.

How has Iran responded to the US?

Iran has announced it will no longer abide by restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal, under which it agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.

US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles.

Iran refused and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the deal.

In a statement, it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development.

The leaders of Germany, France and the UK - which were all signatories to the 2015 deal, alongside China and Russia - responded with a joint statement urging Iran to refrain from ""further violent actions or support for them"".

""It is crucial now to de-escalate. We call on all the players involved to show utmost restraint and responsibility,"" they said.

What has Trump said about Iran?

Mr Trump has vowed to strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"".

He also repeated a controversial threat to target Iranian cultural sites on Sunday, despite criticism from within the US and overseas.

""They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way,"" the president said.

In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mr Trump said the US had identified 52 Iranian sites, some ""at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture"", and warned they would be ""HIT VERY FAST AND HARD"" if Tehran struck at the US.

US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a senior member of the Democratic Party, responded by tweeting: ""You are threatening to commit war crimes.""

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif drew parallels with IS destruction of the Middle East's cultural riches.

""A reminder to those hallucinating about emulating ISIS war crimes by targeting our cultural heritage,"" he tweeted. ""Through MILLENNIA of history, barbarians have come and ravaged our cities, razed our monuments and burnt our libraries. Where are they now? We're still here, & standing tall.""

Targeting cultural sites is banned under the Geneva and Hague Conventions - and violating them would constitute a war crime in the US.

How soon could Iran develop a nuclear bomb?

The country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010.

The 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief.

It restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, to 3.67%. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and allow international inspections.

Before July 2015, Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges, enough to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the White House at the time.

Image copyright AFP Image caption President Hassan Rouhani pictured at a nuclear plant in Iran in 2015

US experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""breakout time"".

Iran's current ""breakout time"", should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb, is estimated to be around a year, but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20%, for example.",Trump threatens Iraq with sanctions if US troops are expelled,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51003159,2020-01-06T05:24:14

Boris Johnson has joined European leaders in a call for all sides to show restraint after the US assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.

In a joint statement with Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron they said the current cycle of violence ""must be stopped"".

Mr Johnson will meet key ministers later and has discussed the deepening crisis with US President Donald Trump.

Iran has vowed revenge after General Soleimani was killed in a US strike.

In the joint statement, issued on Sunday night, Mr Johnson and his French and German counterparts urged restraint and called on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation.

The three leaders said they were concerned by the ""negative"" role Iran has played in the region but called on ""all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility"".

Trump call

With tensions rising in the region following the drone strike ordered by President Trump, Iran has responded by vowing revenge and announcing it will no longer abide by the restrictions in its 2015 nuclear deal.

In the statement, the three leaders urged the country to ""reverse all measures inconsistent with"" the deal.

Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is preparing to assemble key ministers to discuss the spiralling crisis in the Middle East.

The prime minister said he spoke to Mr Trump on Sunday about the assassination of the Iranian general, who spearheaded the country's military operations in the Middle East as head of the elite Quds Force.

The White House said the two leaders had discussed the current situation and ""reaffirmed the close alliance between the two countries"".

Earlier on Sunday, in his first public statement since Soleimani's death, Mr Johnson said the 62-year-old had been ""responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region"".

""Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death,"" Mr Johnson said.

""It is clear, however, that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no-one's interest.""

Mr Johnson said the UK was in ""close contact"" with all sides to encourage de-escalation and said Parliament will be updated when it returns on Tuesday.

Iraqi MPs have responded to the drone strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence.

Caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote.

'Shared threat'

About 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200.

A UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group.

""We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat,"" he said.

Meanwhile, HMS Montrose and HMS Defender are to start accompanying UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, where a tanker was seized by Iran last July.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that he learned of the US attack on Soleimani ""as it happened"", spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Sunday morning.

Mr Raab defended the killing because of the US's ""right to self-defence"" against Soleimani's use of militia's to destabilise the region and attack Western forces.

He also defended Mr Johnson for being on holiday as the crisis unfolded, saying that he had been ""in constant contact with the prime minister over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues"".

Shadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry accused the prime minister of ""sunning himself"" while the chief civil servant chaired three meetings of Cobra, the government's emergency response committee.

Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, who is standing to be Labour deputy leader, said Mr Johnson's response was ""pathetic"", adding that he should stand up to a US president ""recklessly threatening to launch a war"".",Qasem Soleimani: Boris Johnson and European leaders call for restraint,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51004218,2020-01-06T05:38:22
"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption L to R: Olivia Colman, Sam Mendes and Phoebe Waller-Bridge

British stars have had a golden night at a Golden Globes where Australia's bushfires were the main talking point.

The newly knighted Sam Mendes received two awards for his World War I epic 1917 - the same number of trophies won by Elton John biopic Rocketman.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge's sitcom Fleabag won two prizes, while Olivia Colman won for playing The Queen in The Crown.

Once Upon a Time In Hollywood was the biggest winner overall, with Brad Pitt and Quentin Tarantino both recognised.

The revisionist Tinseltown fable was named best musical or comedy, saw Tarantino win best screenplay and earned Pitt his second Golden Globe for best supporting actor.

The event saw multiple mentions of the deadly fires in Australia, which have claimed at least 24 lives since they began in September.

Mendes was named best director for 1917, which went on to be crowned best film drama at the end of the Los Angeles ceremony.

""I really hoped this means people will turn up and see it on the big screen as intended,"" he said as he took to the stage with his film's cast and crew.

Welsh star Taron Egerton, named best actor in a musical or comedy for playing Sir Elton in Rocketman, said the film had been ""the best experience of my life"".

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Egerton thanked Sir Elton John ""for living a life less ordinary""

There was also success for Sir Elton and his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, who won best film song for their Rocketman composition I'm Gonna Love Me Again.

Joaquin Phoenix was named best actor in a film drama for Joker, while Renee Zellweger won the female equivalent for playing Judy Garland in Judy.

The actress, who won her last Golden Globe in 2004, thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) for ""inviting me back to the family reunion"".

Phoenix used his own acceptance speech to exhort his fellow stars to ""take responsibility and make changes"".

""Contrary to popular belief I don't want to rock the boat, but the boat is [doomed],"" said the actor.

""We don't have to take private jets to Palm Springs to the awards sometimes.""

Awkwafina was the other winner in the main film acting categories, winning best actress in a musical or comedy for The Farewell.

The actress and rapper - whose real name is Nora Lum - is the first woman of Asian descent to win the award.

Earlier in the evening, there were two awards for Fleabag as Waller-Bridge was named best actress in a TV series (musical or comedy).

As she collected her award, Waller-Bridge thanked her Irish co-star Andrew Scott for bringing ""so much fire"" to his role as the show's ""Hot Priest"".

Fleabag went on to be named best TV series (musical or comedy) at the star-studded ceremony.

Waller-Bridge used her second acceptance speech to thank former US president Barack Obama for recommending the BBC comedy in a recent tweet.

Image copyright Getty Images/Reuters Image caption Awkwafina and Renee Zellweger won the two main film acting awards

Colman, another of Waller-Bridge's Fleabag co-stars, said she had not expected to be recognised for her work in the third series of The Crown.

""I had money on this not happening,"" the British Oscar-winner admitted as she was named best actress in a drama series.

""For the last year I feel I've been living someone else's life, and now I feel I've won someone else's award.""

Claire Foy, Colman's predecessor on The Crown, also won a Golden Globe for playing The Queen in the Netflix drama.

Colman accepted her prize while wearing a ring promoting ERA 50:50, a campaign advocating equal gender representation on British stage and screen.

Other British winners include Brian Cox, who was named best actor in a drama series for Succession.

The satirical series, created by Peep Show's Jesse Armstrong, was later named best TV drama.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Brad Pitt won one of three awards given to Once Upon a Time In Hollywood

Russell Crowe was another early winner, receiving the award for best actor in a limited series or motion picture made for television for The Loudest Voice.

The Australian actor was not at the ceremony, instead sending a message about the devastating bush fires ravaging his homeland.

""Make no mistake, the tragedy taking place in Australia is climate change-based,"" he said in a message read out by actress Jennifer Aniston.

Pierce Brosnan, whose sons Dylan and Paris are serving as this year's Golden Globe ambassadors, also sent a message of goodwill to those affected by the fires.

Cate Blanchett, meanwhile, paid tribute to the volunteer firefighters who are tackling the blazes.

""When one country is facing a climate disaster, we are all facing a climate disaster,"" the Australian actress declared.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ricky Gervais opened the show with a salty monologue

Ricky Gervais, hosting the event for the fifth time, kicked off proceedings with a salty monologue that poked fun at James Corden, Martin Scorsese and others.

""I came here in a limo and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman,"" he joked - a reference to the US star's recent jail term for her role in a university cheating scandal.

Yet the British comedian also took Hollywood's great and good to task for expressing political opinions while simultaneously accepting money from multinationals with questionable business practices.

""If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech,"" he said. ""You're in no position to lecture the public about anything.""

Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres received a special award at the ceremony, as did actor Tom Hanks.

The two-time Oscar winner was briefly moved to tears as he paid tribute to his ever-supportive family.

As expected, South Korean satire Parasite - winner of the Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes - was named best foreign language film.

""Just being nominated with fellow international film-makers was a huge honour,"" said director Bong Joon-Ho in a speech delivered in his native Korean.

""Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,"" he went on to say via his translator.

One notable upset came in the best animated film category, where stop-motion film Missing Link beat out such hit sequels as Frozen 2 and Toy Story 4.

There was no surprise, though, when perennial Globe favourite Laura Dern was named best supporting film actress for Marriage Story.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Dern plays a ruthless divorce lawyer in Noah Baumbach's drama

The Jurassic Park star - who was Miss Golden Globe in 1982 - has won five Golden Globes for her film and TV work.

Dern's was the only award for Netflix's marital drama, which started the night with more nominations - six - than any other film.

Yet it was one more than Martin Scorsese's mob drama The Irishman, another Netflix production, which failed to make good on any of its five nominations.

The Globes is the biggest ceremony of the awards season outside of the Oscars and many of its award recipients traditionally go on to enjoy success at the later event.

Yet the way the HFPA has spread the riches offers few clues over what films and stars will win Academy Awards on 9 February.

Bosses of Britain's leading firms will be paid more within three working days of 2020 than the average employees' annual wage, according to research.

FTSE 100 chief executives starting work on 2 January will by 17:00 GMT today have been paid more than the average wage of £29,559, the report suggests.

The data was compiled by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the High Pay Centre think tank.

Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the apparent pay gap was ""concerning"".

The figures - based on the latest available data - suggests the average FTSE 100 chief was paid £3.46m in 2018, equivalent to £901.30 an hour.

The average full-time annual salary of £29,559 works out at £14.37 an hour, the report said, meaning that top bosses earned about 117 times their average employee.

The report said high pay will be a key issue in 2020 as this is the first year that publicly listed firms with more than 250 UK employees must disclose the ratio between chief executive pay and that of their average workers, and explain the reasons for their executive pay ratios.

Justify pay

The CIPD and High Pay Centre called on businesses not to treat the new reporting requirements as a ""tick-box"" exercise and to use it as an opportunity to fully explain chief executive pay levels.

Peter Cheese, chief executive at the CIPD, said: ""This is the first year where businesses are really being held to account on executive pay. Pay ratio reporting will rightly increase scrutiny on pay and reward practices, but reporting the numbers is just the start.

Image copyright Getty Images

""We need businesses to step up and justify very high levels of pay for top executives, particularly in relation to how the rest of the workforce is being rewarded.""

Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ""CEOs are paid extraordinarily highly compared to the wider workforce, helping to make the UK one of the most unequal countries in Europe.""

Ms Leadsom accepted that the figures were a concern, but said changes to the rules on reporting executive pay would help shine a light on the issue.

She said: ""Today's figures will be eye-watering for the vast majority of hard-working people across the UK.

""The numbers are better than they were - down a quarter since 2012 and 13% on average since last year - but the situation is still concerning, especially in those cases where executives have been rewarded despite failing their employees and customers.""

But Ms Leadsom added that changes to the way companies report pay would ""increase transparency around how directors meet their responsibilities"".

New car registrations in the UK last year fell to their lowest level since 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

It was the third consecutive year of decline, and the SMMT expects that trend to continue throughout 2020.

Those expectations are largely due to weak consumer confidence and confusion over clean-air legislation.

The organisation also says the industry is facing serious challenges adapting to new emissions legislation.

It says new rules will require a huge expansion in the use of electric and hybrid cars.

But according to the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, the fallout from Brexit remains the biggest ""clear and present danger"" to the sector in the UK.

'Perfect storm'

Figures due out later today are expected to show a total of 2.31 million new cars were registered in 2019, down 2% compared to the year before.

Since reaching a record high of 2.69 million vehicles in 2016, the market has been steadily contracting, in response to what Mr Hawes describes as a ""perfect storm"" for the industry.

A key factor has been the collapse in demand for diesel-powered cars, which fell by 22% compared to 2018.

Image copyright Getty Images

Where once they accounted for half of all new cars sold, now they make up just a quarter of the market.

The SMMT says uncertainty over future air quality rules, and in particular over potential restrictions on diesel vehicles entering city centres, has left consumers confused.

That, combined with political uncertainty and a general fall in consumer confidence, has meant many potential buyers have decided to hang on to their old cars rather than investing in in new ones.

""You can never put it down to one single factor. It has been a perfect storm over the past few years"", says Mr Hawes.

""It's really no surprise the market has been declining. That's why we need a return of confidence and strong economic conditions"".

The situation is not expected to improve this year, however, with the SMMT forecasting a further 1.6 % fall in registrations in 2020.

Electric and hybrid cars

One area in which sales have increased dramatically over the past year is the market for 'alternatively fuelled vehicles', in other words electric cars and hybrids. They rose by more than a fifth. Registrations of pure-electric cars were up 144%, albeit from a very low level.

The problem for the industry is that this increase is not happening nearly fast enough. New EU rules which are being phased in this year, and which enter fully into force in 2021, oblige manufacturers to cut the average CO2 emissions of their new car fleets dramatically - or face swingeing fines.

These targets are expected to remain in force, even after the UK has left the EU. But they imply a cut of more than a third in overall CO2 output, and the industry believes that meeting them will be extremely challenging.

In fact, the SMMT calculates that without other changes, the market share of electric vehicles would have to rise from the current 1.6% to 27% - or the combined share of electric vehicles and hybrids would have to increase from 7.4% to 56%.

Image copyright Getty Images

In reality, manufacturers will not rely solely on selling more low- or zero-emission vehicles in order to meet the targets, they will also be able to withdraw their most-polluting models and sell more efficient petrol and diesel vehicles, for example.

But sales of electric and hybrid vehicles will still need to rise very substantially, and Mr Hawes insists government must play a role.

""These are still expensive technologies. They carry a price premium,"" he says.

""That's why incentives are so significant in determining the uptake.""

Brexit

But of all the clouds hanging over the industry, one remains darker than the rest in the eyes of the SMMT: the aftermath of Brexit.

Although the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January January, what happens after the transition period remains uncertain.

The government insists it will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.

But if that doesn't happen, there remains the possibility that the movement of cars and car parts across the channel could be subject to steep tariffs or disruptive border checks and delays.

Image copyright Getty Images

""That is probably the clear and present danger,"" says Mr Hawes

""Yes, we will always sell cars in the UK and buy cars in the UK. Where they come from will be affected by Brexit. How much you pay will be affected by Brexit.""

""That is right before us now.""",New car registrations at lowest level since 2013,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50985412,2020-01-06T05:30:16

Rain has fallen in fire-ravaged parts of Australia and temperatures have dropped - but officials have warned that blazes will ""take off"" again.

Sooty rain fell down the east coast, from Sydney to Melbourne, with ""torrential"" rain reported in some parts of New South Wales (NSW).

But on Sunday night officials warned temperatures would rise by Thursday.

Despite the respite, haze pollution remained dangerously high.

The National Gallery of Australia in Canberra was shut on Monday ""to mitigate any risk to the public, staff and works of art on display"". The Australian National University in the capital is also closed.

Further south, Victoria's Bureau of Meteorology warned that visibility in Melbourne was less than 1km (0.62 miles) in many parts of the city and its surroundings.

The weekend saw some of the worst days of the crisis so far, with hundreds more properties destroyed. Rural towns and major cities saw red skies, falling ash and smoke that clogged the air.

But by Monday, there were no emergency warnings in fire-ravaged states, following the weather change.

Victoria state had 25 ""watch and act"" alerts and South Australia had one ""watch and act"" alert.

In NSW, all fires were back at the ""advice"" level, the lowest alert level, Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said.

However, Victoria Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp warned ""it will warm up"" and the fires ""will take off again"".

On Monday morning, there were only around 10km between a blaze in Victoria's Corryong and two burning at Kosciuszko National Park in NSW.

""This will be a changing, dynamic situation,"" he said, warning it was ""inevitable"" the fires would join across the border.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more than A$100,000 (£53,000, $69,000) would be released for disaster relief - while A$2bn would be committed to recovery over the next two years.

Turning from orange to grey

Simon Atkinson, BBC News in Eden, NSW

With its drizzle and grey horizon, the wharf at Eden could almost be an English coastal town.

It's hard to fathom that on Saturday night - as fire threatened and skies turned orange - this was where hundreds of people fled for the feeling of safety that came with being near water.

Most have now left. Some to their homes as the fire threat eased. Others to evacuation centres in bigger towns after authorities warned the wharf really wasn't a safe option.

The rain is a welcome surprise, and has given some respite from the smoke-filled air.

But with hot dry conditions predicted later in the week, Eden's people - like many in this corner if the country - are in limbo.

And the navy ship lurking off the coast - poised to help in rescue mission - is another reminder this is far from over.

Australia is fighting one of its worst bushfire seasons, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures and months of drought.

The country has always experienced bushfires but this year they are a lot worse than normal.

At the weekend, Mr Morrison warned the crisis might go on for months.

At least 24 people have died since the fires began in September. Air quality in the capital Canberra was recently rated the worst in the world.

"Labour's ruling body will meet on Monday to agree the timetable for the party's leadership race and the rules for the forthcoming contest.

Five MPs - Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry - have so far entered the running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.

Party officials will decide the length of the contest and who can vote in it.

The BBC's Iain Watson said decisions on the eligibility of new members and registered supporters could be crucial.

More than 500,000 people took part in the last leadership contest, when Mr Corbyn was re-elected in 2016.

Mr Corbyn signalled his intention to stand down last month after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row and his second as leader. His successor is expected to be in place before council and mayoral elections at the start of May.

Labour's National Executive Committee, the party's governing body, will meet to determine how the contest will be conducted, the day before Parliament returns from its Christmas recess.

In order to qualify to take part, candidates need the support of at least 21 MPs, as well as the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions.

One of the key issues to be decided is the ""cut-off"" period for people who are not currently full members of the party and who want to vote.

Under the current rules, anyone in this position would have at least two weeks to sign up - but this deadline could be extended.

If this happens, it is likely to favour candidates such as Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy, who are looking to win back former supporters of the party disillusioned about its direction under Mr Corbyn.

In contrast, those contenders who appear to be more popular with the current left-wing and pro-Remain membership, such as Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, are likely to benefit from a more restricted timetable.

If this sounds like a drab technical meeting, don't be foxed. The decisions taken by this group could influence the outcome of the contest.

If the left-leaning National Executive Committee fears an invasion of the centrists, it could opt to restrict the joining window for registered supporters to a mere porthole, and up the cost even further.

If, on the other hand, they think more people might join to keep the Corbyn flame burning, they can - if they wish - do the opposite.

Now, all this may sound desperately cynical - but last time around, when Owen Smith unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn, a dispute over the leadership rules ended up in the courts.

The NEC will also decide the rules around the participation of registered supporters.

Since 2015, non-party members have been able to sign up temporarily at a reduced cost to cast a vote. When Mr Corbyn first became leader in 2015, people were given two months to sign up for a small fee of £3.

A year later, the NEC gave them just two days - and the fee went up to £25. However, more people signed up in 2016, with about 120,000 registered supporters ultimately taking part.

The NEC is an elected body made of up parliamentarians, councillors, trade unionists and constituency party members.

While Ms Long-Bailey is entitled to attend as one of three shadow cabinet members, the shadow business secretary is expected to be absent as she is likely to enter the leadership contest herself in the coming days.

"Image copyright AFP Image caption Al-Shabab has waged a brutal insurgency in East Africa

One US military service member and two contractors were killed in an Islamist attack on a military base in Kenya.

Islamist militant group al-Shabab attacked the base, used by Kenyan and US forces, in the popular coastal region of Lamu on Sunday.

The US military said in a statement that two others from the Department of Defense were wounded.

""The wounded Americans are currently in stable condition and being evacuated,"" the US military's Africa Command said.

Witnesses to the attack reported hearing gunfire and seeing plumes of black smoke emerge from Camp Simba on Manda Island.

Gen Stephen Townsend, commander of US Africa Command, added in a statement: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of our teammates who lost their lives today.

""As we honour their sacrifice, let's also harden our resolve. Alongside our African and international partners, we will pursue those responsible for this attack and al-Shabab, who seeks to harm Americans and US interests.""

Al-Shabab is linked to al-Qaeda and is headquartered in neighbouring Somalia.

The group has carried out a spate of attacks in the region since it was formed more than a decade ago.

On 28 December, about 80 people were killed in a bombing in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.

What happened at Camp Simba?

The Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF) said ""an attempt was made to breach security at Manda Air Strip"" but the attack was repulsed.

Four militants were killed, it added.

A fire caused by the attack had been extinguished and the airstrip was now safe, a KDF spokesman said.

A nearby airfield used for civilian flights had reopened, aviation officials said.

Al-Shabab said it had ""successfully stormed the heavily fortified military base"" before taking ""effective control of a part of the base"".

The group said the Kenyan military used warplanes to repel the attack.

How extensive was the damage?

The Associated Press news agency reported that two aircraft, two US helicopters and multiple vehicles were destroyed at the airstrip.

Al-Shabab said it had killed nine Kenyan soldiers and had inflicted 17 ""battle casualties"" on US forces.

Seven aircraft and five military vehicles had been destroyed, it added.

A journalist with Voice of Africa tweeted photos of what the militants said was a US aircraft that had been targeted.

The camp has fewer than 100 US personnel, AP reported.

This was the first attack by al-Shabab on US forces in Kenya.

'Audacious assault'

By BBC World Service Africa editor Will Ross

This was an audacious pre-dawn raid by al-Shabab militants.

It is not yet possible to verify al-Shabab's version of events, but there are unconfirmed reports that one of the aircraft destroyed in the attack is a US plane used for spying in the region.

The fact that this happened close to the popular tourist destination of Lamu Island is also alarming.

Since 2011, when Kenya sent troops to fight al-Shabab in Somalia, the jihadist group has carried out frequent attacks on Kenyan soil.

Almost exactly a year ago, 21 people were killed during a raid on the Dusit hotel complex in the capital Nairobi.

Over the last two years, Joy Crookes has released enough music to fill a (decidedly accomplished) debut album.

Those early EPs and one-off singles show a nuanced and individual ear for melody, while her ""mad honest"" lyrics depict love lost and found on the rainy streets of South-East London.

They've earned her fourth place on the BBC Sound of 2020 list, which tips acts for success in the next 12 months.

But if the attention is welcome, Crookes isn't sure she's enjoying it.

""What does it feel like? Anxiety central is what it feels like!"" laughs the singer.

""I could give you the pretty answer but, honestly, it feels like when you go to Winter Wonderland and you get on that huge tower that rises up above Hyde Park then - whomp - it drops and your stomach rises to your eyeballs.

""It's half an incredible feeling because there's so much adrenalin, but the other half is like, 'I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die!'""

The 21-year-old, who is of Bangladeshi-Irish descent, first came to attention when she posted a cover of Hit The Road Jack to YouTube as a teenager.

Since then, she's developed a sound that combines the eclectic range of music her father played as he drove her to her weekly Irish dancing lessons.

""My dad wanted to give me a real education, from Nick Cave to King Tubby to all this Pakistani music,"" she says. ""He'd say, 'This is from your ends of the world, you should hear this.'""

On her best songs - Early, Mother May I Sleep With Danger, Don't Let Me Down - Crookes' blends dreamy guitar lines with shuffling hip-hop rhythms; or rococo piano motifs with lilting Brazilian chord progressions.

""It's like you're a lab scientist, mixing things together,"" she explains - but everything revolves around her husky, soulful voice, which evokes the spirits of Ella Fitzgerald and Amy Winehouse.

To celebrate her position on the Sound of 2020 list, Crookes took a break from recording her actual debut album to chat to the BBC about her rise to fame, impersonating Liberty X, hustling her school-friends, and the pressure to succeed.

The top five acts on the BBC Sound of 2020 list are being revealed in a countdown, with one revealed every day until the winner is announced on Thursday, 9 January.

What's your first memory?

When I was three or four I went into my mum's room and put on her knee-high boots, then I summoned my family like, 'Mum! Dad! Assemble!'

They sat on the sofa, and I walked in and performed Just A Little by Liberty X. We had it on VHS and I stood in front of the TV doing the moves.

Amazing song choice.

Maybe not for a three year old! I remember the night before, I got my mum to cut a hole in my black vest because the girls in the video had leather PVC suits with holes where their cleavage would be. I mean, I didn't have cleavage at three or four, but I wanted to look like them.

So your first memory is a musical one?

Yeah, it's so vivid in my mind. I was so, so concentrated on that performance. I hadn't even practiced it, I was just like, ""This is my time to shine!""

Image copyright Joy Crookes Image caption The singer has also been nominated for the Brits rising star award

I heard you were quite an entrepreneur as a child, too...

Where did you find that out?! But, yeah, when I was about nine, I worked out it would cost me £80 to get everyone in my family Christmas presents. So I went to Poundland in Elephant and Castle, and you could buy a box of 10 candy canes for £1. I worked out that if I sold each of them for £1, I could make 900% profit.

I also had a side hustle selling clothes, because that £80 needed to come quick. If someone said, ""That top looks great on you"", I'd say, ""I'll give it to you for a fiver"".

When my mates came round to our house, little did they know, it wasn't playtime, it was selling time!

If music doesn't work out, you can always apply for the Apprentice.

I probably will!

You grew up listening to music - but was there a point where you thought, ""This is something I can do for a career?""

I never had that epiphany because I never thought music was a legitimate job. I thought that pop stars were pop stars and that's who they were. I almost didn't see them as human beings until Kate Nash came about.

She made me realise I could use music as a diary. I was going through a lot at home and I didn't have anyone to talk to, so I just used my guitar. But I didn't really think, ""Oh, I'm a musician now"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The singer-songwriter is self-taught on the guitar, piano and bass

How did you learn to play?

With piano, I learnt a couple of chords at school, then I taught myself the songs from the film Once by looking up the chords on YouTube. With guitar it was the same: I learnt two chords from a family friend, then I went home and learned a lot of Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber songs because, no offence, I thought they'd be easy.

I used to have a cupboard that had a mirror on it, so I'd sit down and watch myself playing guitar. That's really good when you're learning, because you can watch where your hands are going.

So that was my mentality, and then I started writing after that.

What happened next?

My mum's friend had a son who was my age who played the most incredible Brazilian guitar. I loved Astrud Gilberto, so I asked him round to mine and I said, ""Do you know this song Hit The Road Jack? I think we should cover it"".

So we recorded it on iMovie, put it on YouTube and it got 500,000 views - which was mad.

Things really exploded in 2017 when you played Mother May I Sleep With Danger on the YouTube channel Colors. The video's now been watched 8 million times. Did it change your career?

That song was never meant to be a single. I wrote it on my own, at the piano, on the first of January 2017. But the Colors performance made more sense than the record, because I'd been playing the song on tour. When you tour a song you get to know it - you stay over at its house, you meet its mum, you get to know the sibling it doesn't like. So by the time we did Colors, it was a walk in the park.

That performance was our third take and I remember I pretended my mum was right there and I was singing it to her.

The video really changed everything. For about six months after that, everywhere I went people would say, ""Are you Joy from Colors?""

You thought music wasn't a viable career, so did that video force you to rewrite the story in your head?

It definitely started kicking in there. We'd gone to Germany [to make the video] and I was like, 'What do you mean I'm flying to Berlin for work, to sing songs?'

But even after that, I went for a job interview as a waitress at a Kurdish restaurant.

Did you get the job?

No! As soon as I went for the interview, I regretted it. The manager was looking at me like, ""What do you mean, you can't work on most days?""

Several of your songs, like For A Minute and London Mine, are love letters to London. Why does it inspire you so much?

The beauty of London is that it wouldn't be London without all the immigration, and the mix of cultures and colours and the smells and the stories it contains.

I grew up on a street where my neighbours are Bajan and the neighbours after that are Bengali and the neighbours after that are from Nigeria. I learned so many mannerisms and different forms of respect and stories and myths and legends from all these places. I wouldn't be the person I am without London. It inspires me to be a certain kind of woman, and a certain kind of person.

Image copyright Joy Crookes Image caption Crookes is currently recording her debut album, with a self-imposed deadline of May 2020

American musicians often eulogise their hometowns, but it's not so common in the UK. Why is that?

I love my area, and London as a whole, so I think I should sing about it and celebrate it.

But when I write about London, it's also a response to the austerity of the last 10 years. For A Minute is about growing up in an area that may not be rich or vibrant, but making the most out of things like having £2 to go to the chicken shop after school. There's a lyric, ""eating sunshine every day"", that's a comment on poverty.

Then I also talk about ""creamy legs in London air"" because when I was growing up all the girls from secondary school, who are mainly black and brown, would have the most moisturised legs you've ever seen in your life.

So I try and have a positive message: ""Hey, this is the sick stuff about London. If we all packed up and left, and went back to India, Yorkshire or wherever, you wouldn't know what to do. It wouldn't be London any more.""

There's a fearlessness in the way you talk about relationships, too. I love that line in Man's World - ""I find my love in red wine"".

I was very angry when I wrote that! I'm saying I find my love in something that's an object, as opposed to you. You are less important to me than a drink.

At least alcohol's always there when you need it.

Exactly. That's probably a very Irish message!

On a more serious note, you've been playing a new song recently that addresses your mental health...

Yeah, it's called Anyone But Me. The first line is, ""Seven years strong with my therapy, making mosaics of my memories,"" so there's no mucking around. It's literally like, this is how I feel: I feel like there's another person living in my head.

It's something I've battled with for a long time. I remember when I was 12, I rang up the NHS and said, ""I can't get out of bed. I'm not ill, I haven't got a cold, I just can't get out of bed"". And the guy on the other end of the phone said, ""Ah, have you heard of depression?""

Have you spoken to your therapist about how the music industry could affect your health?

No, I haven't been able to see him because I haven't had time - which is not good. And I'm kind of struggling with that now. The first album just makes me want to crap myself. I'm like, ""Why am I stressed every day, I should be excited about this? But why should I be excited when this is nerve-wracking?""

I'm massively over-thinking everything. It's like when I did my GCSEs, I was the type of person who'd leave an exam going, ""Oh my God, I failed that"". Then I got all As and A stars, and dropped out straight after.

Where does the pressure to succeed come from?

It's all me. My manager is like, ""You don't have a deadline for the album"", and I'll go, ""Yes I do. It's May."" I've got IBS. I am the most stressed person ever.

That doesn't come across in the music…

Thank goodness.

I can't imagine what an IBS song would sound like, though.

Maybe like that Mabel song, The Anxiety Anthem? I could do the IBS Anthem, and the video would be me against a green screen, and the background would be the inside of your insides.

A colonoscopy?

Yeah! Perfect.

"Image copyright AFP Image caption Protests against the violence began on Sunday night

Students in several major Indian cities are planning protests after students and teachers of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in the capital Delhi were attacked on Sunday night.

At least 40 students and staff were admitted to hospital after being attacked by masked men wielding sticks.

Police have begun a probe and say they have identified some of the assailants.

Students in some cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad have already taken to the streets in support of JNU.

The JNU student union blamed Sunday's violence on the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student body linked to India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, the ABVP said that its members had been attacked by left-wing groups, and some had been injured.

The cause of the attack is still unclear. There were violent clashes at JNU last year over a rise in hostel fees.

The university initially released a statement informing students that ""armed miscreants"" were ""roaming around, damaging property and attacking people"".

It later released another statement in which it blamed a ""group of students"" who were opposing an ongoing admission process to register new students. It is widely believed that the statement referred to leftist students who have been protesting against the hostel fee hike for the past three months.

The university also recently saw protests over a controversial citizenship law.

Students at the university said they would take out rallies against the violence on Monday. A group of them also protested against police ""inaction"", alleging that it took them hours to get to the campus.

The atmosphere around the campus is still tense, reports the BBC's Vikas Pandey who is at JNU.

""Students are really worried about their future. They fear more attacks. The fear is such that many of them refused to talk on camera, fearing reprisals. They all blame the ABVP for the violence,"" he said.

Further protests in support of JNU are being planned in several other cities as well.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Police said they had secured the campus and deployed officers to deter further violence

In the financial capital, Mumbai, university students will continue a protest against the incident at the Gateway of India monument. They had gathered there by midnight, with more and more people joining in since then.

The students of Jamia Millia Islamia university in Delhi and the Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh state, which have also recently seen violence on campus premises, are planning to take out big protests on Monday.

Demonstrations are also expected in the cities of Hyderabad, Chennai (formerly Madras), Ahmedabad and Chandigarh.

The violence has been condemned across the board, including by defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and foreign minister S Jaishankar - both of whom are alumni of the university.",JNU: Students across India to protest against campus violence,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51004204,2020-01-06T06:50:32

Aliens exist and it is possible they are among us on Earth, the first Briton to go into space has said.

Dr Helen Sharman told the Observer Magazine that extra terrestrial life is bound to be somewhere in the universe.

""Aliens exist, there's no two ways about it,"" she said, adding that ""there must be all sorts of different forms of life"" among the billions of stars.

Dr Sharman, 56, made history when she travelled to the Soviet space station Mir in May 1991.

The chemist, who now works at Imperial College, London, added that although aliens may not be made up of carbon and nitrogen like humans ""it's possible they're here right now and we simply can't see them"".

In the interview, she also highlighted her frustration at being referred to as the first British woman in space, rather than simply the first Briton.

""It's telling that we would otherwise assume it was a man,"" she said.

""When Tim Peake went into space, some people simply forgot about me. A man going first would be the norm, so I'm thrilled that I got to upset that order.""

She said being in space ""taught me that it's people, not material goods, which truly matter"".

She added: ""Up there we had all we needed to survive: the right temperature, food and drink, safety. I gave no thought to the physical items I owned on Earth.

""When we flew over specific parts of the globe, it was always our loved ones we thought of down below us.""

The front pages continue to focus on the diplomatic crisis between the United States and Iran.

The Guardian says Donald Trump's administration has been ""scrambling"" to justify its claim that the killing of General Qasem Soleimani was about stopping a war, rather than starting one.

""Attack the White House"" is the headline in the Daily Mirror, which suggests the Iranians have put a £60bn bounty on President Trump's head.

In its leader, the Daily Express calls the ramping-up of threats between the countries ""entirely predictable and extremely disconcerting"". It urges the government to do its best to ""de-escalate the situation"" to avoid what it calls ""Gulf War 3"".

The Sun takes a more robust line. Under the headline ""stand up to evil,"" it says Boris Johnson should throw his weight firmly behind the Americans. It argues that by supporting Washington, the Prime Minister will ""do wonders for the special relationship"" between Britain and the US.

There is concern in the Daily Telegraph's opinion column that Iran may try to stop oil tankers using the Strait of Hormuz - the sea channel through which shipping passes, in order to leave the Gulf.

""Britain is especially vulnerable to this action,"" it says. It calls for the UK's armed forces to be deployed ""to protect our interests"".

Trump promises Iraq sanctions if US troops expelled

Donald Trump has threatened Iraq with sanctions ""like they've never seen before, ever"", after its parliament voted for US troops to leave the country. Tensions are high following the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US air strike in Baghdad last week.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has issued a call - along with France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel - for restraint. Mr Johnson will meet senior ministers later to discuss the escalating crisis in the Middle East. But he has said he will ""not lament"" the death of Soleimani, whom he blamed for playing a ""leading role"" in thousands losing their lives.

Did the UK meddle in a US presidential election?

By Jude Sheerin

""A guy like that doesn't deserve to be president,"" President George HW Bush told his sister about Bill Clinton. He viewed the young Arkansas governor as a scoundrel and felt confident he could roll over him.

But to Bush's mystification, his saxophone-tootling challenger's popularity in opinion polls was even defying the gravity of revelations about his draft-dodging past.

Bush had another problem - his campaign was as stale as the recession-sapped US economy. So he turned for inspiration across the Atlantic to his friend, UK Prime Minister John Major.

I've seen mini-delivery trucks pootle around at walking speeds on test tracks and I've been in a driverless car with a human very much at the wheel, fingers nervously poised millimetres from the steering wheel ""just in case"".

And rightly so - when autonomous car tech goes wrong, as Tesla and Uber can both testify, the results can be catastrophic.

With all that in mind, I wasn't expecting there to be no driver at all.

It's a disconcerting thing to be sitting in the backseat of a car with nobody between you and the windshield, especially when that vehicle is travelling at 40mph (64km/h) with pedestrians nearby.

A man called Alexei, the ""engineer"", was in the front passenger seat - so there was a ""just in case"" of sorts.

Alexei had a comically large red button that would have done, well, something dramatic, I suppose. They wouldn't let me press it.

But as we hit speeds of 44mph on our 20-minute driverless drive, we changed lanes numerous times and negotiated busy junctions without human input - emergency or otherwise.

Yandex has a surprisingly low profile in the West given that it is often referred to as ""the Russian Google"". Just like Google, it is a tech giant with fingers in many pies. It says most of its revenue still comes from its search engine, which enjoys a 60% market share in Russia.

It entered the driverless car game in 2016, and got its vehicle on public roads in December 2017. Since then, it has honed the tech on the streets of Moscow and Tel Aviv.

Yandex's fleet has clocked 1.5 million miles (2.4 million km) of autonomous driving so far. That puts it behind the likes of Google's Waymo, which had achieved more than 10 million as of July 2019.

""The robot drivers which we are developing, they cannot get distracted,"" Yulia Shveyko, head of media relations for Yandex driverless cars, tells me.

The fleet is already used by Yandex's rideshare service in Moscow.

""So we have passengers who are using our app to order rides. They're going to the university, post office, grocery store, and it's completely integrated into their typical routines,"" she adds.

""And what we've seen is that within a very quick time period, once they feel safe it starts to feel very normal.""

I can't vouch for this of course - except to say next time I am in Moscow, I will try to rock up at a supermarket in a driverless car and see if anybody bats an eyelid.

'Exhilarating at first'

I have to admit that after an exhilarating first few minutes, it all felt pretty normal to me too.

Later, I decided to take a second driverless ride - this time from rideshare service Lyft, which is offering driverless journeys around Las Vegas in its fleet of adapted BMWs during CES.

My colleague Cody and I didn't tell them we were journalists, mainly because we couldn't get a word in edgeways, but this was a far more cautious journey.

There were two humans in the front - a driver and a man called Dan who seemed to be a kind of tour guide. The vehicle was actually in manual mode much of the time. Not all of the hotels have agreed to this tech being used on their private property, so getting on and off the strip required human effort.

If you want an opinion about anything, ask a cabbie. So, later on, I hopped into yet another car, showed the driver, Steve, a little video I filmed of the Yandex experience and asked him what he thought.

""Driverless cars are scary to me,"" he said.

""I need to be in control or somebody needs to be in control, not the computer-control.""

"About 100 million animals are killed for meat in the UK every month - but very little is heard about the people doing the killing. Here, one former abattoir worker describes her job, and the effect it had on her mental health.

Warning: Some readers may find this story disturbing

When I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.

It was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it's not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.

I was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.

Whether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There's animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.

And the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.

Why would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?

For me, it was because I'd already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.

On my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I'd get used to it.

Soon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I'm sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You'll know if you've ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.

Personally, I didn't suffer physical injuries, but the place affected my mind.

As I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I'd witnessed throughout the day.

One skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn't just make the job easier - it's necessary for survival.

There are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.

At the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.

Whenever I walked past that skip, I couldn't help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I'd participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.

I know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I'll never forget the day, after I'd been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.

I took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, ""It's just not right, it's not right,"" over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.

Even worse than pregnant cows, though, were the young calves we sometimes had to kill.

A physically demanding role

On its website, the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) says the UK meat industry has some of the highest standards of hygiene and welfare in the world.

Many of its members, it says, ""are at the forefront of abattoir design with facilities designed to house the animals and help them move around the site with ease and without any pain, distress or suffering"".

Meat processing in the UK employs about 75,000 people of whom approximately 69% are from other European Union member states, the BMPA notes.

""The barrier to British people taking up roles in meat processing is an unwillingness to work in what is perceived to be a challenging environment,"" it says. ""Most people, while they eat meat, find it difficult to work in its production partly because of the obvious aversion to the slaughter process but also because it is a physically demanding role.""

At the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I'd been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.

We tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.

When the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne. When we put the first calf in, it only came about a quarter of a way up the box, if that. We put all five calves in at once. Then we killed them.

Afterwards, looking at the dead animals on the ground, the slaughterers were visibly upset.

I rarely saw them so vulnerable. Emotions in the abattoir tended to be bottled up. Nobody talked about their feelings; there was an overwhelming sense that you weren't allowed to show weakness. Plus, there were a lot of workers who wouldn't have been able to talk about their feelings to the rest of us even if they'd wanted to. Many were migrant workers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, whose English wasn't good enough for them to seek help if they were struggling.

A lot of the men I was working with were also moonlighting elsewhere - they'd finish their 10 or 11 hours at the abattoir before going on to another job - and exhaustion often took its toll. Some developed alcohol problems, often coming into work smelling strongly of drink. Others became addicted to energy drinks, and more than one had a heart attack. These drinks were then removed from the abattoir vending machines, but people would still bring them in from home and drink them secretly in their cars.

'I'm an animal lover'

For The Food Chain, the BBC's Emily Thomas met a slaughterman at Tideford abbattoir, who described his approach to his work:

""Basically, I'm an animal lover. I don't take any pleasure in what we're doing, but if I can do it as quietly and professionally as possible, then I think we've achieved something. Just be professional, do it, then switch off - and then, when we've finished work, go home and be a normal person. It's not for everybody. I know a couple of butchers that would not walk inside this abattoir; the thought of taking something's life, they find that difficult to accept, or witness.""

Listen to The Food Chain: Inside the Abbattoir

Abattoir work has been linked to multiple mental health problems - one researcher uses the term ""Perpetrator-Induced Traumatic Syndrome"" to refer to symptoms of PTSD suffered by slaughterhouse workers. I personally suffered from depression, a condition exacerbated by the long hours, the relentless work, and being surrounded by death. After a while, I started feeling suicidal.

It's unclear whether slaughterhouse work causes these problems, or whether the job attracts people with pre-existing conditions. But either way, it's an incredibly isolating job, and it's hard to seek help. When I'd tell people what I did for work, I'd either be met with absolute revulsion, or a curious, jokey fascination. Either way, I could never open up to people about the effect it was having on me. Instead I sometimes joked along with them, telling gory tales about skinning a cow or handling its innards. But mostly I just kept quiet.

A few years into my time at the abattoir, a colleague started making flippant comments about ""not being here in six months"". Everyone would laugh it off. He was a bit of a joker, so people assumed he was taking the mick, saying he'd have a new job or something. But it made me feel really uneasy. I took him into a side room and asked him what he meant, and he broke down. He admitted that he was plagued by suicidal thoughts, that he didn't feel like he could cope any more, and that he needed help - but he begged me not to tell our bosses.

I was able to help him get treatment from his GP - and in helping him, I realised I needed to help myself too. I felt like the horrific things I was seeing had clouded my thinking, and I was in a full-blown state of depression. It felt like a big step, but I needed to get out of there.

After I left my job at the abattoir, things started looking brighter. I changed tack completely and began working with mental health charities, encouraging people to open up about their feelings and seek professional help - even if they don't think they need it, or feel like they don't deserve it.

A few months after leaving, I heard from one of my former colleagues. He told me that a man who'd worked with us, whose job was to flay the carcasses, had killed himself.

Sometimes I recall my days at the slaughterhouse. I think about my former colleagues working relentlessly, as though they were treading water in a vast ocean, with dry land completely out of sight. I remember my colleagues who didn't survive.

And at night, when I close my eyes and try to sleep, I still sometimes see hundreds of pairs of eyeballs staring back at me.

"Image copyright Too Good To Go Image caption Mette became a multimillionaire when she was 33

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Mette Lykke, co-founder of fitness tracker Endomondo, and chief executive of food waste app, Too Good To Go.

For many people, leaving the stability of a well-paid job to start your own business might seem daunting. For Danish entrepreneur Mette Lykke, it's a leap she's made not just once, but twice.

Back in 2007 she was working for management consultancy firm McKinsey, but decided it was time to change direction. ""I was missing the feeling of having a real impact,"" she says.

In a serendipitous twist she was in New York when a stranger came over and handed her a postcard. It read: ""Whatever our wildest dreams may be, they only scratch the surface of what's possible.""

""It was just a nice sign,"" the 38-year-old recalls. ""She gave it to me when I was waiting at a red light, and she just walked away.""

Mette decided to go for it and partnered with fellow Danes and McKinsey colleagues, Christian Birk and ­Jakob Jonck, to launch the personal training app Endomondo.

""I might have done it anyway,"" she says. ""But it definitely didn't feel like a coincidence at that time.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fitness app Endomondo was sold to Under Armour for $85m

Mette was a competitive horse-rider and for the three sports enthusiasts, launching an app to ""make fitness fun"" was a logical fit. Making a success of their Copenhagen-based idea was no walk in the park though.

At that time - 13 years ago - most phones lacked GPS. In the first few months of Endomondo there were days when no one signed up at all. ""It really felt a little bit uphill,"" she says.

Mette says that her upbringing helped prepare her for the hard graft. She grew up alongside her family's timber business in Ringkobing, a small town in Jutland in western Denmark. ""I grew up seeing that there are ups and downs,"" she says.

""Most days are just hard work, [but] if I had known back then that I wouldn't see any salary for the next two years, I might have reconsidered,"" she laughs. ""You just don't know.""

As an entrepreneur, ""you're definitely an optimist,"" she explains. ""We always thought next month is going to be different.""

The game-changer came when the Apple App Store opened in 2008 and smart phone sales boomed. But it still took Endomondo six years to make its first profit.

Image copyright Too Good To Go Image caption Too Good To Go says it now has more than 18 million users

By 2015, the app had 20 million users and caught the attention of American sportswear giant, Under Armour.

""They were particularly interested in increasing brand awareness in Europe,"" says Mette. ""We could help with that, with the vast majority of [our] users being based here.""

The US company bought Endomondo for $85m (£65m). Mette was just 33 at the time, and she and her two co-founders were suddenly multimillionaires.

""It's a strange thing to sell a business you were part of creating,"" she says. ""While the deal was a big success from a business perspective and I was happy with the decision, it was still hard to let go of my baby on a personal level.""

After the sale she continued to work for Endomondo and its new parent, managing teams both in Copenhagen where she was based and also in Texas.

It was following a chance encounter on a bus outside Copenhagen in August 2016 that the Dane embarked on her next mission - fighting food waste. She started chatting to a fellow passenger who showed her an app called Too Good To Go.

""I was not fully aware of how big of an issue in society food waste really is,"" recalls Mette. After doing more research she was shocked to learn about its climate impact. ""That was mind-blowing to me.""

Image copyright Too Good To Go Image caption Mette now employs 450 people at Too Good To Go

Five young Danish entrepreneurs had launched the online marketplace several months earlier. Restaurants and shops post what leftover food they have available, together with a time-slot for collection.

Members of the public can then purchase discounted meals or groceries through the app. The surplus food is saved from being thrown away - the firm makes money by taking a cut on meals sold.

""The fact that we can help solve such a massive issue and then leave everyone as winners in the process, I thought that was really powerful,"" says Mette.

She found the start-up ""so exciting"" that she invested. Several months later she left Under Armour and joined Too Good To Go as chief executive. ""I wouldn't have jumped into this if I didn't think I could contribute,"" she says.

According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, one-third of the world's food is wasted. When ranked alongside countries, food waste is the world's third-largest producer of carbon dioxide after the USA and China.

In recent years dozens of firms have set out to tackle this, including similar platforms like Olio, Foodcloud and Karma. Alan Hayes, from food and grocery research group IGD, says these apps have ""helped to raise awareness of food waste in businesses and in schools"" as well as empowering consumers.

When it comes to changing behaviour about food waste, Trish Caddy, an analyst at fellow research firm Mintel, thinks consumers respond better to rewards. ""The Too Good to Go app is particularly good at normalising eating leftovers by promoting end-of-day food at a discount,"" she says.

Image copyright Too Good To Go Image caption More than 30,000 food firms are signed up

Mette has overseen a rapid expansion. The firm now employs 450 people, operates in 13 European countries and is due to roll out in Sweden.

""Endomondo took three years to get to the first million users and with Too Good To Go it took 15 months,"" she says. ""It's just a completely different time… the technology is ready.""

Mette says it is one of Europe's fastest-growing apps with 18 million users and is gaining an additional 45,000 daily. Customers range from bargain-hunting students to environmentally-conscious young families, while women over 50 are another big market. It has also partnered with more than 30,000 food suppliers, from Yo Sushi to Accor Hotels.

More The Boss features:

Mette describes it as a ""social impact"" company. ""Every time we make a euro in revenue, it's because we did something good.""

It aims to ultimately be profit making, though Mette says the timeline for delivering returns isn't yet clear. ""At the moment, every revenue we make goes back into the business. Just growing it and expanding it to more and more countries. That's our focus.""

So far the Too Good To Go team reckon they have helped save more than 25 million meals.

""I feel like this is just the beginning,"" says Mette. ""It doesn't feel like we're anywhere near the goal line at all. Within the next five years, we want to have saved a billion meals.""",The female entrepreneur stopping food waste,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50974009,2020-01-06T00:02:21
"Image copyright PuduTech Image caption BellaBot is a waiter with attitude

A robot cat designed to ferry plates of food to restaurant customers has been unveiled at the CES tech expo in Las Vegas.

BellaBot, built by the Chinese firm PuduTech, is one of a number of wacky robotic inventions being shown off at the event this year.

There is also UBTech's Walker, which can pull yoga poses.

And Charmin's RollBot. It speeds a roll of toilet paper on demand to bathrooms that have run out of the stuff.

One expert said it was likely that robots exhibited at CES would only continue to get more bizarre in the future.

BellaBot, the table-waiting robot cat, is a service bot with personality.

Image copyright PuduTech Image caption The device has four trays, each capable of bearing up to 10kg of grub

It updates a previous model that had a more utilitarian design. BellaBot, in contrast, features a screen showing cat-face animations.

It mews when it arrives at tables to encourage customers to pick up their food.

And if the diners stroke BellaBot's ears, it initially reacts with pleasure.

""The owner's hand is so warm,"" the bot is programmed to say in response.

But if customers continue petting it for too long, its expression changes.

""It gets mad to remind you not to interrupt its job,"" explains the firm.

Image copyright PuduTech Image caption BellaBot becomes irate if diners rub its ears for too long

The Chinese company is targeting the machine at restaurant owners in China, who often struggle to employ enough waiting staff, according to PuduTech.

The firm's existing robots are already in use at 2,000 restaurants worldwide.

It plans to show off the new device at a booth designed to look like a futuristic restaurant when the CES show floor opens on Tuesday.

But BellaBot may find it harder to operate in the real world, commented tech consultant Paolo Pescatore from PP Foresight, because of the challenge of navigating restaurants at busy times.

He added, however, that restaurants are expected to become increasingly dependent on automation in one form or another.

Image copyright UBTECH Image caption It does yoga - but Walker will not buy you a quinoa salad afterwards

UBTech's newly-updated Walker bot is also being shown off at CES this year.

The model can perform a series of Tai Chi and yoga poses, demonstrating a ""huge improvement in motion control"", according to its maker.

""It's continuously tracking its overall centre of gravity throughout the yoga positions - the kind of dynamic [artificial intelligence] you would expect of a robot that 'lives' in your home alongside your family, going up and down stairs, carrying heavy objects for you,"" explains UBTech spokesman Jeff Gordon.

Walker's other abilities including being able to push a cart, draw pictures and pour liquid into a cup.

And Procter & Gamble's American loo roll business, Charmin, has attracted a flurry of attention with an unusual droid designed to complement toilets and bathrooms: RollBot.

""Imagine yourself there, you've run out of toilet tissue, nobody hears your call,"" P&G researcher Gregg Weaver told the BBC.

""The robot will find you in the home and deliver you a fresh roll.""

Image caption RollBot answers nature's call

RollBot is summoned via Bluetooth on a smartphone.

However, P&G currently has no plans to make it commercially available - which may mean waiting a little longer for that desperately needed roll.

Thanks to improvements in hardware and software capabilities, robots will gradually become better and better at expressing themselves and mimicking human capabilities, predicted Mr Pescatore.

He also suggested that in commercially competitive, consumer-facing settings, quirky robots were likely to stand out from the crowd.

"When US President George HW Bush craved ""a smoking gun"" in 1992 to politically kneecap his White House challenger Bill Clinton, the British government delved into its files for damaging information. So, did the Bush camp solicit foreign interference to help him win an election - the allegation that has seen President Trump impeached?

""A guy like that doesn't deserve to be president,"" President Bush told his sister about Clinton.

He viewed the young Arkansas governor, who was the same age as Bush's eldest son, as a scoundrel and felt confident he could roll over him.

But the president sorely underestimated a political thaumaturge, so gifted that his ascent to the White House had been foreseen when he was aged just seven by his school teacher.

To Bush's mystification, his saxophone-tootling challenger's popularity in opinion polls was even defying the gravity of revelations about his draft-dodging past.

The Republican, a decorated World War 2 fighter pilot, dictated to his diary: ""I'm tired of this guy lying and ducking on the draft and not coming clean.""

Bush had another problem - his campaign was as stale as the recession-sapped US economy.

So he turned for inspiration across the Atlantic to his friend, UK Prime Minister John Major.

The British premier's come-from-behind general election win in April 1992 was being touted by American conservatives as a blueprint for the US president.

Bush had a very special relationship with Major, his brother-in-arms from the 1990-91 Gulf War, as has previously been revealed in transcripts of their private conversations obtained by the BBC.

He once spoke of sending him ""a love letter"" and assured the British PM ""obviously we're rooting for you"" to beat Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.

Major, critics suspected, returned the favour.

Two UK Tory panjandrums - architects of the PM's surprise victory - flew to Washington eight weeks before the US election and advised the Bush team to focus attacks on Clinton's character.

The president's campaign hired an opposition research specialist to dig for dirt in Britain.

What happened next was either a bureaucratic mishap, or an egregious act of political meddling by the UK in the internal politics of a friendly nation.

At some point in early October 1992, the Home Office inspected its immigration nationality section to see whether Clinton had applied for British citizenship while at Oxford University from 1968-70 in order to escape the Vietnam draft.

Briefing reporters on background, the department said its ""comprehensive"" check was conducted out of ""sheer helpfulness"" to the media, even though it usually always rebuffed journalists with the stock answer that it did not discuss individual cases.

Nothing compromising on the Democrat was discovered, though it remains an open question how any such political bombshell, had it been excavated, would have been handled by Whitehall.

That same month, a frustrated Bush would dictate to his diary that ""we cannot get this smoking gun on Clinton"".

More on US presidents

All Major could offer him were well wishes.

The British premier called Bush on Air Force One during a last burst of campaigning two days ahead of November's election.

""I wanted to wish you a great hurrah and all of my best for the home stretch,"" Major said, according to a transcript of their conversation at the Bush presidential library in Texas.

But he had backed the wrong horse - Clinton trounced Bush.

Returning to the White House a day after he lost, the humiliated one-term president grew emotional, according to biographer Jon Meacham.

Bush dictated to his diary that he was thinking to himself: ""How in God's name did this country elect a draft dodger?""

A month later, when the Home Office publicly acknowledged having carried out the file check, the victorious Clinton did not hide his annoyance.

""They should have more pressing business,"" he said of British officials when asked about the controversy during a morning jog in Little Rock, Arkansas.

That very same day, 6 December 1992, Major wrote a letter of apology to the US president-elect.

According to a copy of the correspondence, declassified only last year by the UK National Archives, the British premier said he was ""disturbed by reports which have appeared about enquiries by our Home Office relating back to your time at Oxford"".

""I am only sorry,"" Major added, ""that it has been played up now in a mischievous way. I hope the mischief will be short-lived.""

The file does not indicate that Clinton responded.

Later that month, Major flew to Washington on an official working visit. He had hoped to mend fences with the president-elect during the trip.

But Clinton declined to meet him - the Washington Post described it as a snub.

With the so-called special relationship on ice, Labour MPs jeered the prime minister in the House of Commons in February 1993 as he denied taking sides in a US election.

Margaret Beckett, the opposition's deputy leader, was among members of Parliament who shook her head sceptically at Major's explanation.

""No I didn't buy it,"" the MP for Derby South tells the BBC, remembering that day in the chamber 27 years ago.

""I thought at the very least there must have been a nod and wink [between the US and UK].

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bush and Clinton - pictured with Major (L) at Russian leader Boris Yeltsin's 2007 funeral - struck up a friendship after leaving office

""And probably a bit more than a nod and a wink, 'if you can find something, George [HW Bush] might be rather grateful'.

""Because it [the Home Office records search] seemed to me like the kind of thing most civil servants would be fairly wary about doing.""

Whosever idea it was, Beckett says, it was ""quite a big mistake"".

In a statement to the BBC, Major - now a knight of the realm - denied approving the Home Office file search.

His spokeswoman, Dame Arabella Warburton, says: ""Sir John did, indeed, have a close working and personal relationship with President George HW Bush.

""However, Sir John neither sanctioned, nor had any knowledge of, Home Office checks being carried out on George Bush's Presidential rival Bill Clinton.""

No-one in the Bush camp set any UK official to go rummaging for such skeletons in Clinton's closet, insists Charles Black, who was a senior adviser to the president's re-election bid.

""I'm pretty confident that nobody in the campaign asked for it,"" he tells the BBC.

""It didn't come up in the meetings I had with the [UK] Conservatives, so maybe somebody in the [US] government did.""

The two top Tory apparatchiks who flew to Washington were Sir John Lacy and Mark Fullbrook. Lacy died in 2009 and Fullbrook declined to comment to the BBC.

James Pinkerton, who was deputy assistant to Bush and worked on the campaign, thinks his former boss' hands were clean.

""Bush was an ethical, honest guy,"" he tells the BBC, ""and if you said to him, we're going to do a dirty trick to help you win, he would've said, no.""

But despite his reputation for civility and decency, ""the last gentleman"" - as Bush's admirers call him - did not always measure up to the ideal of noblesse oblige.

In his political life, he was fully prepared to fight dirty to win, as evidenced by the infamously race-baiting attacks he launched in 1988 to tar his then-Democratic challenger, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, as soft on crime.

Bush effectively blamed his rival for the torture and rape of a white couple by a black felon, Willie Horton, who had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on a weekend-release programme.

And as Ronald Reagan's deputy, Bush blatantly lied when insisting he was ""out of the loop"" on the administration's secret effort to trade arms with Iran for hostages in violation of its own policy.

""I'm one of the few people who know the details,"" the vice-president had confided to his diary.

George Herbert Walker Bush - who died one year ago, aged 94 - was an intensely competitive man.

In 1980, as his dream of capturing the Republican presidential nomination began to slip away in the wake of defeat to Reagan in New Hampshire, Bush penned a revealing note to himself on a flight.

""I WILL NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER. NEVER,"" it said in bold scrawl. He gave up three months later.

Sidney Blumenthal, a historian and former Clinton White House aide, tells the BBC that ""of course"" the Home Office files search was done at the behest of the British government in cahoots with team Bush.

He notes that former Bush chief of staff James Baker - who declined to speak to the BBC for this article - stated in a 1992 memo, cited recently by the New York Times, that the commander-in-chief would not have enlisted the UK to aid his campaign.

""And yet somehow the Home Office went ahead,"" Blumenthal archly adds. ""Hard to believe that they [the British government] would do this entirely unbidden.""

The UK action might be dismissed as the suspected rogue meddling of an over-zealous ally, except that it was mirrored by a simultaneous muck-raking exercise within the Bush administration.

Just as the Republican president was making an issue of his rival's past opposition to the Vietnam War, a government warehouse in suburban Maryland was being scoured for damaging information on Clinton, and even his mother.

This scandal came to be known as Passportgate.

A stinging Department of State inspector general report would later implicate two Bush political appointees in having Clinton's documents unsealed. It was a fruitless bid to find out if the Democrat had ever considered renouncing his US citizenship during the Vietnam conflict.

While the watchdog did not establish the White House had directly instigated the invasion of privacy, it found Baker was aware of the ""heinous activity"", yet did nothing to stop it.

Baker was cleared three years later of any ""criminal intent"" in the matter by an independent counsel investigation set up under then-and-current US Attorney General William Barr.

Beyond the suspicions, no concrete proof has emerged of collusion between Bush and Major in the US election of '92.

But even if there was, isn't what President Trump allegedly did - brazenly soliciting the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to harm the election prospects of his potential White House challenger, Joe Biden - worse?

Not under US campaign finance law, according to Ann Ravel, former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission.

It is illegal for anyone to seek or accept anything of value from a foreign national in an American election, she points out.

Ms Ravel, who led the federal regulator in 2015, tells the BBC: ""It would be the equivalent of what we're seeing now [with Trump] because obviously it would be a request by the Bush White House for what is something of value to the campaign.""

Though so much about the Trump presidency is said to be unprecedented, foreign interference in elections - with the occasional connivance of unscrupulous US office-seekers - is as old as the American republic itself.

As he pursued his own political ambitions, Founding Father Thomas Jefferson enabled outrageous French meddling in US internal affairs.

When President George Washington infuriated Paris by forging a peace treaty with Great Britain in 1794, Jefferson briefed against his commander-in-chief to the French ambassador, who was trying to wreck the accord.

As vice-president to John Adams in 1797, Jefferson was suspected of treason when he undercut his boss by sabotaging Franco-American peace talks, again via diplomatic back channels.

How prescient that a decade earlier Adams had written to a friend in France: ""As often as Elections happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.""

That letter was addressed to Jefferson.

"The murder was so brutal it shocked even the hardened detectives who arrived at the scene on the outskirts of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Bushra Iftikhar, a 28-year-old housewife, had been stabbed with such force that the knife her assailant used had bent out of shape, and he had continued the attack with a screwdriver.

The killer? Her husband, Sami Ullah.

The couple had four children already, and at the time of her death Bushra Iftikhar was pregnant with their fifth. Why exactly her husband killed her remains unclear. He claimed in court to have been suffering a mental breakdown and to have no recollection of the incident. Her family says he accused her of wanting to convert to another religious sect.

But what does seem clear is that Sami Ullah was a violent man. He had previously been accused of the attempted murder of a neighbour, and of being part of a violent argument at a restaurant.

Police believe he should have been in prison, but instead he didn't even face a proper trial.

According to Bushra Iftikhar's brother, Sami Ullah's family were influential in the local area and had paid money to the victims of those earlier cases.

""In the old cases, he gave money and quickly got out of prison,"" Mohammad Zakaria bluntly told the BBC.

Under Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes, including most instances of murder. All they have to do is state in court that they forgive a suspect ""in the name of God"". In reality, legal observers agree that the primary motive for that ""forgiveness"" is normally financial, and the informal payment of money to victims is not illegal.

Image caption Mohammad Zakaria believes his brother-in-law became more violent after the first incidents

The provisions allowing crimes of bodily harm to be ""settled"" or ""forgiven"" were introduced in the 1990s as part of a set of Islamic-inspired legal reforms.

Supporters of the system say it helps reduce pressure on Pakistan's already overburdened and delay-ridden court system, and reduces the likelihood of feuds developing. But according to one study, the murder conviction rate in the country dropped from 29% in 1990, before the laws were introduced, to just 12% in 2000.

Critics argue the law can give repeat offenders a sense of impunity, and is a tool for the more powerful to evade justice. Bushra Iftikhar's brother believes the fact her killer was never punished in any of his previous cases only made him grow more violent.

""He became arrogant. He thought: 'I did this, and nothing happened. Now I'm free and the law can't touch me.'""

Sami Ullah's family admit the previous cases had ended in what are often termed ""compromises"", but insist they had agreed them to avoid a drawn-out legal process, not because Sami Ullah was guilty. Sami Ullah is currently appealing against a death sentence after being convicted of murder.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Many cases never even make it to court (pictured: the Supreme Court in Islamabad)

Ashtar Ausaf Ali, who served as attorney general under the previous government, put forward plans to reform the laws in 2015 whilst still retaining the element of forgiveness.

""A person has the right to forgive,"" he told the BBC from his office in the city of Lahore, but he added that crime wasn't just a matter for an individual, but for society.

His idea was to introduce mandatory minimum sentences, so that ""people would know that they cannot put a price tag on a crime"".

Despite being supported by some clerics, Mr Ali's proposals were blocked by a number of Islamist politicians. At the moment, there seems little prospect of them being resurrected.

Undermining the system

The current law is a source of frustration at times for both police officers and criminal prosecutors. Courts do have the right to reject settlements if they believe they are coerced, but most observers agree that due to the number of cases in the court system, they rarely investigate thoroughly.

Meanwhile, one detective told me he had come across dozens of examples of offenders reaching a settlement with their alleged victims only to go on to reoffend. He said the police would spend time and resources investigating a crime only for the case to end abruptly.

Then there are other times, when the police themselves can be the beneficiaries of such ""settlements"".

Image copyright Handout Image caption Salahuddin Ayubi died after being arrested

In August, CCTV images of a thief sticking his tongue out at the camera as he stole a bank card from a cash machine in the central Pakistani city of Faisalabad went viral on social media.

But the case took a grim turn as shortly after Salahuddin Ayubi was arrested by police, he died in custody.

The compromise

Suspicions mounted after another video emerged of Salahuddin Ayubi, who apparently initially pretended to police that he was deaf and mute, writhing in pain as a policeman twisted his arms behind his back while another interrogated him.

Salahuddin's father, Muhammad Afzal, initially pressed for justice for his son, who is believed to have suffered from a mental illness. However, a month later, he announced he was forgiving the policemen accused of killing him ""in the name of God"".

The ""settlement"" or ""compromise"" in that case is understood to have consisted of an agreement the authorities would build a new 8km (five-mile) road in the family's village, as well as a new gas pipeline, not to mention the payment of an undisclosed sum of money.

Salahuddin's father seemed content with the deal, which was brokered by a radical cleric with links to the intelligence services. But others, who don't have powerful backers or the weight of public pressure behind them, often end up feeling as if they have no choice but to agree with what is being offered to them.

In a village outside Lahore, I met the family of another man who died in police custody. He had been detained after wrongly being accused of murder.

The BBC is not revealing the family's names in order to protect them from repercussions, but they say a mixture of coercion and money led them to drop the case against the police officers they hold responsible for his death.

""We haven't forgiven them in our hearts,"" the victim's brother told me. ""We never will, but we were helpless.""

He said a steady stream of local politicians and influential figures had arrived on his doorstep when they began to fight for justice.

""They would say: 'Do a deal. If you don't, you won't be able to do anything anyway. Maybe they'll go to jail for six months or a year, after that they'll be freed and can make all sorts of trouble for you.'""

The family are poor and were offered enough money to buy a house, something they would have struggled ever to do otherwise. They accepted, but the mother remained distraught at the bargain she felt forced to make.

""I wish to God that we were still living in a rented house, and my son was still alive,"" she said. ""They took my son and gave me money for a house, what kind of deal is that?""

"Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.

The fires, burning since September, have intensified over the past week, with a number towns evacuated. High temperatures and strong winds are forecast for the weekend, creating further fire risk.

Twenty people have so far been killed - including three volunteer firefighters - and about six million hectares (60,000 sq km or 14.8 million acres) of bush, forest and parks have been burned.

Sorry, your browser cannot display this map

If you can't see the map click here.

New South Wales has been worst affected

In the worst-hit state, New South Wales (NSW), fire has affected more than four million hectares, destroying more than 1,300 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere.

Hot, dry weather combined with prolonged drought and strong winds have created perfect conditions for fire to spread rapidly.

More than 130 fires were burning across the state on Friday, in the bush, mountain forests and national parks, with about 60 still not contained by firefighters and posing a risk to lives.

The fires have been exacerbated by 40C temperatures and strong winds, creating difficult conditions for the thousands of firefighters deployed in the field.

The small town of Balmoral, south-west of Sydney, was largely destroyed and scores of homes were razed amid catastrophic conditions on 22 December.

But conditions are still dangerous and a state of emergency for NSW has come into force. Parks, trails and camping grounds have been closed and holidaymakers have been told to urgently leave a 260km (160-mile) stretch of NSW coast before Saturday, 4 January, when extreme conditions are forecast.

Other states are also suffering

In Victoria, more than 800,000 hectares have been burned. Fires have been burning since late November but the have caused devastation in recent days, leaving two people dead and destroying around 43 homes in East Gippsland.

In the small town of Mallacoota, residents fled to the beach on 31 December, with only a change in the wind direction keeping the fire from reaching them on the shore.

Around 1,000 tourists and residents were eventually evacuated by the Australian navy and taken further down the coast.

The military has sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts.

A state of disaster has been declared for the worst-hit areas in Victoria, which allows the authorities to enforce evacuations and let emergency services take over properties.

Satellite images show the spread of smoke from fires in Victoria and NSW, which has affected air quality as far away as New Zealand.

In the state of South Australia, the Cudlee Creek fire is reported to have destroyed more than 80 homes in the Adelaide Hills region.

The fires are also thought to have destroyed up to a third of the vines that provide grapes for the Adelaide Hills wine industry.

In the Australian capital Canberra - an administrative region surrounded by NSW - bushfire smoke meant air quality there was rated the third worst of all major global cities on Friday, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual.

Very hot and dry conditions, with strong winds and thunderstorms are expected - posing further fire risk.

The fires have been worse than usual

To put the fire damage in New South Wales in perspective, some 900,000 hectares were lost in the 2019 Amazon fires and around 800,000 hectares burned in the 2018 California wildfires.

The total area of land affected by the NSW fires would cover most of the south of England.

Although Australia has always had bushfires, this season has been a lot worse than normal.

Humans are sometimes to blame for starting the fires, but they are also often sparked by natural causes, such as lightning striking dry vegetation.

Once fires have started, other areas are at risk, with embers blown by the wind causing blazes to spread to new areas.

Bush fires themselves can also drive thunderstorms, increasing the risk of lightning strikes and further fires.

The number of people killed as a result of the fires since September 2019 is higher than in recent years.

Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster was ""Black Saturday"" in February 2009, when some 180 people died in Victoria.

If there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties, authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast - faster than most people can run.

So is this down to climate change?

Many Australians are asking that very question - but the science is complicated.

Scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.

Data shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.

Australia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C.

By the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.

A climate phenomenon is causing the heatwave

The main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.

The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years.

As a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia.

Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.

""The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,"" he says.

""A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country.""

And meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue.",Australia fires: A visual guide to the bushfire crisis,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50951043,2020-01-03T15:19:10

Once a bastion of English and History departments, the British studies discipline is waning as American students increasingly put career goals over their love of Charles Dickens, writes James Jeffrey.

It's Friday afternoon at the University of Texas at Austin, which means it's time for sherry and a weekly lecture on British studies. The complimentary libation is served on a silver tray next to a large stuffed lion, a jovial nod to England's national animal and the country's lionised literary past.

Recent talks have included Revisiting Brideshead Revisited, Churchill's Most Difficult Decisions and The Novels of Benjamin Disraeli and Oscar Wilde.

The audience leans toward the mature end of the spectrum - one ex-faculty member who attends is 97 years old. A few undergraduate and graduate students are dotted around but they are definitely in the minority.

British studies is up against shifting trends in American universities as history and English departments focus less on Western Europe and more on other parts of the world.

America quit being a British colony almost 250 years ago but until recently the UK loomed large culturally.

""As a field, British Studies was inflated in relation to other parts of the world during the 20th Century,"" says Jason Kelly, director of the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Arts and Humanities Institute.

""Folks have become more concerned about other places and interests around the globe, which I have to say is increasingly productive for thinking about the world, and more in tune with the challenges we face as a global community.""

Image copyright - Image caption In 1946 Churchill coined the term ""special relationship""

This has led to a dramatic decline in the number of British studies courses over the past few decades.

At the same time, enrolment in undergraduate British history courses has declined ""precipitately"", according to a report by the North American Conference on British Studies (NACBS).

Nowadays, the report laments, the discipline is considered by many ""to be old-fashioned, hide bound, conservative and boring - a discipline of old men in tweed coats who still hanker after the stuffy and sexist atmosphere of the senior common room.""

Those within British studies, however, note the decreasing numbers reflect a wider trend within the humanities as it struggles in the face of changing expectations among students. Since the late 1990s the number of English degrees has fallen by nearly half, according to the US Department of Education. History in general is down about 45% from its 2007 peak.

""The cost of college is exploding, there's this complete inflation in US higher education,"" says Professor James Vaughn, a historian specialising in Britain at Ohio University.

""If one has to attend for four years at great cost, you want some remuneration, so the STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] subjects are seen as having massive pay-offs compared to the humanities and the social sciences.""

This has been compounded since the financial crash of 2008, with students increasingly fearful that a humanities degree won't lead to gainful employment, says Paul Halliday, president of NACBS.

Nevertheless, all may not be lost for British studies.

""As the balloon of British studies has deflated, we've seen it redefining itself in terms of what it means and does,"" Kelly says. ""What we have been seeing, especially in the last decade, is British studies reorienting itself to increasingly focus on the British Empire and its lasting impact and influence around the world.""

Image copyright James Jeffrey Image caption British studies, along with other humanities, is losing students in the US

This is particularly relevant for those wanting to better understand how the US got to where it has, especially on the global stage.

""Our laws and national institutions, but also character, are so shaped by being part of the British Empire and breaking away from it,"" says Erika Rappaport, the American author of A Thirst for Empire: How Tea Shaped the Modern World.

""We can't understand the history of US global influence without understanding that Great Britain laid the groundwork, infrastructure and ideologies of globalisation while building and losing their empire in the 19th and 20th Centuries.""

Rappaport became interested in British history and empire studies through a love of reading Victorian literature as a teenager that left her ""dying to find out more about the culture that produced such amazing literature"".

She says the history of the US being a former colony of the UK has created ""a love-hate relationship"".

""We share so much in terms of our consumer culture and education, but at times our tastes are very different,"" says Rappaport, citing how the US fondness for coffee stemmed from Americans turning away from British food stuffs - such as tea - because these reminded them of their colonial status.

The UT Austin British Studies programme - it is not a degree in itself - began in 1975 based on weekly lectures about English literature, history and government.

Since then it has hosted many eminent speakers - CP Snow, the British novelist and scientist, spoke in 1976 on Elite Education in England; Iris Murdoch in 1985 spoke on Themes in English Literature and Philosophy; and the historian Michael Howard spoke in 1993 on Strategic Deception in the Second World War.

Image copyright James Jeffrey Image caption The British Studies programme at the University of Texas at Austin has adopted a stuffed lion - the national animal of England - as its unofficial mascot

""I like the interdisciplinary ethos, how you get to meet people from other departments,"" says 34-year-old Trevor Simmons during a break in the carol singing at the recent British Studies Christmas Party. He completed a PhD in British Economic History in 2015 and still attends the weekly talks.

""It's also done in a fun way. You've got the sherry, the stuffed lion, the oak panels - it's a little bit of Oxford.""

Programme director and founder Roger Louis says the programme strives to include a multitude of perspectives from different nations caught up in the British historical experience, ranging from Scots and Irish to Jamaicans, Indians, Australians and Nigerians.

""Ongoing discussions in British studies are engaging because of the clash of different perspectives as well as the nuance of cultural interpretation,"" Louis says.

This global aspect of British studies, Halliday says, is its greatest strength in remaining valid and competitive as the humanities try to appeal to students.

""In the last ten years there has been an explosion of interest in the field in the types of problems that are affecting everyone, such as how the consumer society was predicated on slave labour and the destruction of indigenous people,"" Halliday says. ""This re-orientation has expanded the reach of British studies.""

Image caption British studies once focused on on classic works by Victorian authors, like Charles Dickens, but now includes modern writers from nations that used to be part of the British Empire, like Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

Kelly says he saw this reflected in the impressive breadth of views on display when he attended this year's annual NACBS conference in Vancouver, Canada.

""The younger faculty entering the discipline are able to research more broadly, synthesise new information and challenge the presumptions of the older faculty members,"" Kelly says. ""It's refreshing and makes you realise that British Studies isn't going anywhere soon.""

""I view myself as a global citizen, and my dream job would be with the UN,"" 20-year-old Lucas Peralta remarked at the Christmas party, after taking British Imperialism in the Middle East as part of his International relations and global studies degree.

""So understanding the influence of the UK there and also with the likes of Nato is extremely important.""

The ongoing impact of colonialism was on the mind of 22-year-old history undergraduate Ana Chan at the Christmas Party. She has been following the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, explaining how Britain has always been on the periphery of her life because her family came to American from Hong Kong.

""My family have mixed feelings,"" Chan says. ""They remember places they couldn't go under British colonial rule because of affordability. I've heard family friends discussing whether it was a good thing for Hong Kong to be separated from mainland China for so long given the trouble happening now. At the same time, I was raised to view Britain as a close ally of the US.""

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Recent issues like Brexit have fired up an interest in British studies

Halliday, who teaches history, says Brexit has put Britain back on the minds of many of his students.

""Both the UK and the US have always been deeply tied to the rest of the world,"" he says. ""That's why Brexit interests my students: it reads like a reversal of centuries of British interconnection with Europe and beyond.""

History professor Vaughan says his students have also been drawing comparisons between the shock of Brexit and Donald Trump's unexpected election and want to discuss what ""it's all about"".

UT Austin programme director Louis recalls the words of Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the US from 1948 to 1952, when he discussed the special relationship between the UK and US during a British Studies lecture given in 1989.

""He said that we are a people who have a lot in common and are trying to solve common problems,"" Louis says.",Why fewer US students want to learn about UK these days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50987303,2020-01-05T00:47:47
"Media playback is not supported on this device Curtis Jones' stunning first goal for Liverpool gives them win over Everton

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said his team's performance was ""sensationally good"" as Curtis Jones' stunning winner earned the Reds a fully deserved FA Cup third-round victory and extended Everton's miserable record of Anfield failure.

The German made nine changes from the side that increased their Premier League lead to 13 points with victory over Sheffield United on Thursday - including three debutants in Takumi Minamino, Nathaniel Phillips and substitute Yasser Larouci.

And it was 18-year-old Jones who grabbed the Merseyside derby glory with a magnificent curling 25-yard drive that eluded the outstretched arms of Everton keeper Jordan Pickford as it arced into the top corner after 71 minutes. The Toffees remain without a win at their rivals since September 1999.

Klopp said: ""I saw a sensationally good performance of a not very experienced team with a lot of players playing for the first time on this kind of stage, in front of this crowd, against the opponent. It was outstanding. I loved it - I loved each second of this game.

""If you want to be a Liverpool player, you have to respect the principles of this club. We cannot always play the best football in the world but we can fight like nobody else. And as long as we use our principles, we will be a difficult opponent to play against.""

The Reds boss had the luxury of resting superstars such as Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Virgil van Dijk, survived the early loss through injury of James Milner, and yet still saw his side fully merit their place in the fourth round.

Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti played virtually his strongest available side but the visitors paid for a lacklustre display and a succession of missed opportunities in the first half, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Mason Holgate and Richarlison saw efforts saved by Liverpool keeper Adrian.

The Italian blamed a drop in his side's performance level during the match.

""The line-up of Liverpool didn't affect our idea of how to play,"" he said. ""We knew that Liverpool put in fresh players and that the intensity could be a high intensity, so I think the defeat arrived because we were not able to keep the intensity in the second half.

""We lost energy, we lost confidence, we were not able to build up quick from the back.

""We are going to speak and work together to find a solution to help improve the team. I know we have to work.""

The fourth-round draw takes place on Monday at 19:35 GMT on BBC One and the iPlayer, before Arsenal's game against Leeds.

Klopp's kids deliver in style

Media playback is not supported on this device FA Cup: Liverpool 1-0 Everton highlights

Liverpool are the team who have forgotten how to lose - and they were playing an Everton side who have long forgotten how to win at Anfield.

Klopp took no chances with his big players but the Reds still had too much energy for this laboured Everton team.

Divock Origi added physicality up front but it was the likes of Jones and 16-year-old Harvey Elliott who epitomised the host club's victory - along with 22-year-old central defender Nathaniel Phillips, effectively brought back from a loan spell at Stuttgart to play in this game.

It was a moment of genius from Jones, born two years after Everton last won at Anfield, that made the difference before Liverpool closed out the victory with maturity and without problems from a bitterly disappointing Everton.

They even survived the blow of losing Milner in the opening minutes, depriving Klopp of one of his most experienced players. In the event, it just gave another teenager, Yasser Larouci, his chance to shine.

Klopp and his players took the acclaim in front of the Kop after the final whistle as Liverpool's dream season continues.

Gutless Everton outline Ancelotti's task

Carlo Ancelotti (right) has suffered two defeats in the past two matches having begun his Everton reign with two wins

Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti now knows the full extent of the job he must undertake at Goodison Park.

This was as embarrassing as it gets for Everton, outmanoeuvred and beaten by what was more or less a Liverpool reserve team.

And for many players whose names are on this loss, it will surely prove to be a watershed moment and the beginning of the end of their careers at the club.

Gylfi Sigurdsson, at £45m, was a lightweight passenger in midfield, too easily shrugged off the ball, outpaced and deservedly substituted - he looked heavy-legged and unfit for purpose.

Morgan Schneiderlin has been out injured but he was also miles off the pace, while Theo Walcott produced an absolute horror show of a performance, riddled with dreadful decisions and cheap concession of possession.

True, it took a magnificent strike for Liverpool to clinch their place in the fourth round and Everton squandered so many first-half chances but this was what the visitors' effort, or lack of it, deserved.

On this day, when presented with a below-strength Liverpool, Everton were exposed as faint-hearted and lacking in stomach for the fight.

This was a grim chapter - the only forward-looking note being that Ancelotti has been given a rapid reminder of exactly why Everton paid so much to bring him to Goodison Park.

Man of the match - Curtis Jones (Liverpool)

Curtis Jones (18 years and 340 days) is Liverpool's youngest goalscorer in a Merseyside derby since Robbie Fowler (18 years and 338 days) in the Premier League in March 1994

Toffees toppled again in the third round - stats

Liverpool remain unbeaten in their past 23 home games against Everton in all competitions (W13 D10); they have beaten the Toffees twice at Anfield in the same season for the first time since the 1986-87 campaign.

Everton have never won away to Liverpool in the FA Cup in six attempts (D4 L2).

Liverpool have progressed from the FA Cup third round in eight of their past nine seasons, failing only in 2018-19 thanks to a 2-1 defeat at Wolves.

Everton have been eliminated in the FA Cup third round in four of the past six campaigns, as many as in the preceding 20 seasons.

Liverpool have won 23 of their past 25 home games in all competitions (D2), keeping a clean sheet in each of their past five matches at Anfield.

Origi has been directly involved in six goals in his five home Merseyside derby appearances against Everton, scoring five and assisting Jones' winner.

Liverpool named three teenagers in their starting XI for a Merseyside derby (Harvey Elliott, Neco Williams and Jones) for the first time since October 2012 (Raheem Sterling, Suso and Andre Wisdom), a 2-2 draw in the Premier League at Goodison Park under Brendan Rodgers. Indeed, the Reds had not started a single teenager in any of their previous 10 meetings with Everton in all competitions before today.

"Dom Sibley (left) and Joe Root put on 116 for the third wicket

Second Test, Newlands, Cape Town (day three of five): England 269 & 218-4: Sibley 85*, Root 61 South Africa 223: Elgar 88, Van der Dussen 68, Anderson 5-40 England lead by 264 runs Scorecard

Dom Sibley made an unbeaten 85 as England took total control of the second Test against South Africa on day three in Cape Town.

The opener played a fine watchful knock for his maiden Test fifty to help the tourists grind down the Proteas and close on 218-4, a lead of 264 runs.

England captain Joe Root hit a fluent 61 before he and nightwatchman Dom Bess fell late on at Newlands.

James Anderson (5-40) claimed two quick wickets to dismiss the hosts for 223.

It gave England a first-innings lead of 46 that they turned into a match-winning position with a sensible batting display.

England now have two days to force victory and level the four-Test series at 1-1.

Patient Sibley shows the way

Sibley had shown glimpses of ability in his five previous Test innings but only had a top score of 29 and needed to secure his long-term spot.

While fellow opener Zak Crawley played more positively, but fell for 25 from a loose drive at Kagiso Rabada, Sibley left well outside off stump and waited for South Africa to stray on to his pads.

The Warwickshire batsman then whipped forcefully through mid-wicket and calmly clipped off his hips, but proved he has more range as he went on, playing a few lovely cover and square drives.

Other prospective solutions at opener have played impressive innings and faded but the patient manner of Sibley's knock is encouraging, not least with Rory Burns now expected to miss March's tour of Sri Lanka with the ankle injury he sustained playing football.

Although Joe Denly fell into the trap, hooking Anrich Nortje to fine leg for 33, the second-wicket stand of 73 gave Root a rare platform to come in and busily up the scoring rate.

He scored all round the wicket to help England inflict the kind of demoralising day on a fielding side they have themselves experienced often recently and appeared set to push on for a century on day four, only to nick one as Dwaine Pretorius found some late movement.

Bess made his second duck of the match, gloving Nortje behind from what proved to be the final ball of the day, but protected Ben Stokes from having to bat and England are well-placed to declare whenever they want on day four.

Evergreen Anderson back to best

James Anderson needs 18 more wickets to become the first pace bowler to take 600 wickets in Tests

Following Anderson's below-par performance in defeat at Centurion, his first Test back after a long-standing calf injury, Root said one of Anderson or Stuart Broad could be dropped for this match - before Jofra Archer was ruled out injured.

Both the retained seamers impressed on day two and Anderson was back to his ruthless best on the third morning to ensure South Africa's tail barely added to the hosts' overnight total.

He removed Rabada caught behind for a duck with the first ball of the day before Nortje fell to another fine catch by Stokes at second slip - the first time an England non-keeping fielder has taken five catches in a Test innings.

Anderson, 37, now has 28 five-wickets hauls in Tests and has taken 102 wickets in 26 matches at a staggering average of 20.67 since his 35th birthday.

Any significant injury, like the one that kept him out of the majority of the summer's Ashes series, will invite questions about the future of England's all-time highest Test wicket-taker.

But if he can return at this level and remain such a threat, England may enjoy his talents for a while yet.

Most five-wicket hauls for England in Tests James Anderson: 28 in 151 Tests Ian Botham: 27 in 102 Tests Sydney Barnes: 24 in 27 Tests Graeme Swann: 17 in 60 Tests Fred Trueman: 17 in 67 Tests Derek Underwood: 17 in 86 Tests Stuart Broad: 17 in 136 Tests

'A terrific day for England' - what they said

England's James Anderson on Sky Sports: ""We've had a really good day. We wanted to be ruthless with the ball and we were.

""I have missed Test cricket. It gives you a buzz when you get out there. The biggest thing for me at Centurion was getting through it. I was desperate to prove my place in the team. I was a bit rusty, but I feel up to speed in this game.

""The bowling group we have keeps you on your toes. It makes for healthy competition and a good bowling attack.""

BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew on The Cricket Social: ""A terrific day for England. It was one of those days where they just had to do it. Sibley has also come out and done what he had to do.

""They should get another 100 runs and Sibley should get his hundred. England should not bat on past lunch.

""Led by that bowling performance by James Anderson and some terrific catching by Stokes, they have got themselves back in this game - and should go on to win it.""",England in South Africa: Dom Sibley's 85 not out puts tourists in control,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/51000780,2020-01-05T16:44:16
"Lynch's touchdown was his 10th career play-off rushing TD, putting him eighth on the all-time list

The Seattle Seahawks and Minnesota Vikings both won on the road to reach the second week of the NFL playoffs.

The Seahawks beat the Philadelphia Eagles 17-9 after Marshawn Lynch and DK Metcalf touchdowns in each half.

And Minnesota upset the NFC's number three seed, a Kyle Rudolph touchdown in overtime giving them a shock 26-20 win at the New Orleans Saints.

Seattle now visit the Green Bay Packers in the NFC divisional round while the Vikings are at the San Francisco 49ers.

Wentz injury derails Eagles

While Philadelphia won the NFC East, Seattle finished the regular season with a better record and the Eagles suffered a host of injuries as they won their last four games to reach the play-offs.

And they were dealt another huge blow on just their second drive as they lost quarterback Carson Wentz to a head injury, meaning 40-year-old back-up Josh McCown became the oldest player in NFL history to make his post-season debut.

The two teams traded field goals before running back Lynch, who helped Seattle win Super Bowl 48 and only re-signed two weeks ago, barged over from five yards to give the Seahawks a 10-3 lead at the half.

Philadelphia kicked field goals either side of Russell Wilson's 53-yard touchdown pass to Metcalf in the third quarter, but were unable to launch a late fightback.

""We stayed consistent. We answered the call,"" Wilson said. ""More than anything else we believe - there's no doubt in us.""

Saints shocked at the Superdome

Meanwhile, the Saints were firm favourites to beat the Vikings having almost reached last year's Super Bowl and won this season's NFC South with a 13-3 record while the Vikings (10-6) earned a wildcard spot.

But the visitors led 20-10 going into the final quarter, with Dalvin Cook scoring rushing touchdowns either side of the half after New Orleans' Alvin Kamara ran in the game's opening touchdown.

Versatile back-up quarterback Taysom Hill gave the Saints hope, catching a 20-yard pass from Drew Brees with 10:37 left to become the first player in NFL history to register over 50 passing yards, over 50 rushing yards and over 25 receiving yards in a play-off game.

And although Danielle Hunter forced Brees' first fumble of the season, the Saints had one more drive and Wil Lutz, who missed a 43-yard field goal right before half-time, made a 49-yard kick with two seconds remaining to send the game into overtime.

Minnesota won the coin toss for the opening possession, knowing a touchdown would win it, and Kirk Cousins made a gutsy 43-yard throw to Adam Thielen before finding tight end Rudolph for a four-yard touchdown to seal the upset.

That win was the second shock of wildcard weekend after the Tennessee Titans won 20-13 at the New England Patriots to knock out the defending champions.

Like the Patriots' Tom Brady, veteran quarterback Brees is now out of contract and the 40-year-old's future is uncertain.

""I'm not making any comments on that other than I've always just taken it one year at a time,"" he said.

""I'll kind of re-evaluate each off-season and then find the things that I want to get better at and move on.""

"There were some big squad numbers on display at Anfield for Liverpool

A total of 132 team changes were made by the 19 Premier League sides in FA Cup third-round action this weekend.

Sheffield United, eighth in the top flight, fielded an entirely different starting XI for their 2-1 win over National League AFC Fylde.

There were 20 changes alone in the all-Championship Charlton-West Brom tie.

Attendances were also significantly down as Premier League and Championship sides saw a combined drop of more than 150,000 on their previous home gates.

Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder admitted that the early stages of the FA Cup had lost the appeal of years gone by.

""It's certainly lost a touch in the build-up to it,"" he said.

""You never used to see any changes in the third round. But the introduction, rise and growth of the Premier League means that's by far the biggest competition in this country.

""I hope people understand why we made 11 changes.""

Only four top-flight sides made fewer than five changes, while the 23 Championship clubs made a total of 166 alterations to their starting sides.

Line-ups aside, there were plenty of other things to note from a busy weekend of FA Cup action...

Where were all the fans?

Only 5,828 were present for Cardiff against Carlisle

One other notable element of the weekend's FA Cup action was the number of empty seats at stadiums across the country.

Traditionally a landmark moment in the football calendar, the third round saw attendances at Premier League and Championship grounds significantly down.

Of the teams from those two divisions playing at home, only one - Middlesbrough, who hosted Tottenham - saw an increased attendance compared to their previous home fixture.

Sheffield United completely closed the Kop stand at Bramall Lane, meaning only three sides of the ground were open, while Cardiff narrowly avoided registering their lowest attendance at the Cardiff City Stadium - their 5,828 against Carlisle surpassing the 4,111 who watched their Carabao Cup tie against Luton in August.

One of Saturday's upsets came at Craven Cottage, where Championship Fulham knocked out Aston Villa, but even that game was watched by a relatively paltry 12,980, way down on the 18,575 who attended the Cottagers' league game against Reading three days earlier.

An 'uncomfortable' weekend for VAR

Referee Michael Oliver checks the pitchside monitor prior to dismissing Luka Milivojevic at Crystal Palace

While the video assistant referee system has divided opinion in the Premier League, this weekend it divided the FA Cup itself.

VAR technology was in use - but only at Premier League grounds.

So it was not in operation at Middlesbrough, where Tottenham felt the hosts' goal should have been ruled out for offside, but it will be in operation for the replay at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium following the 1-1 draw.

And the fact it was in use at some grounds but not others was a cause for concern for BBC Radio 5 Live's Pat Nevin.

""Some teams have got it today and some teams haven't and that's uncomfortable,"" he said.

There was a rare occurrence at Selhurst Park, where referee Michael Oliver broke from the Premier League norm by consulting the pitchside monitor for a key FA Cup decision.

After doing so, he changed his verdict, sending off Palace captain Luka Milivojevic after initially giving him only a yellow following a tussle with Derby's Tom Huddlestone.

A weekend for long-range wonder goals

While managers made changes galore and some stadiums were half-empty, some of those players who were selected took their chances - and fans were rewarded with stunning goals.

Here are a few of the best strikes - and more memorable moments - from the weekend's action...

The stars of the big and small screens have been walking the red carpet at the 2020 Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles, California.

Here are just a few of the striking outfits that were on display.

Nominees this year included Jodie Comer, who was up for best actress in a drama series for Killing Eve, and Andrew Scott, who was up for a supporting actor prize for playing the Priest in Fleabag.

Neither won, though there was better fortune for Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The British writer and actress, who is both the creator and executive producer of Killing Eve and the creator, writer and star of Fleabag, won two prizes for the latter show.

Few celebrities rock a red carpet like Billy Porter, who was nominated for best actor in a drama series for his work in the second series of Pose.

The US actor and Broadway star said he would be swearing off red wine, spaghetti and make-up for the duration of the ceremony, lest they sully his pristine outfit.

White was also the choice of Gillian Anderson, Reese Witherspoon and Margot Robbie, though the latter did pair her white trousers with a multi-coloured top.

Olivia Colman and Dame Helen Mirren - who have both won Golden Globes for playing British queens - chose regal shades of red for this year's ceremony.

The pair were nominated again this year, and again for royal roles - The Queen in The Crown in Colman's case (which she went on to win best drama actress for), and Catherine the Great in Dame Helen's.

Three of this year's best actress nominees - Kirsten Dunst, Cynthia Erivo and Joey King - all chose bold gowns for their red carpet appearances.

Dunst was up for best actress in a television series (musical or comedy) for On Becoming a God in Central Florida.

Erivo and King, meanwhile, were nominated for playing real people - Harriet Tubman in the film Harriet in Erivo's case, and Gypsy Rose Blanchard in TV drama The Act in King's.

""If you win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech.""

From the moment Ricky Gervais took to the stage to host the 77th Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, it was clear he wasn't taking any prisoners.

""You're in no position to lecture the public about anything,"" he told the stars during his opening monologue. ""You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.""

Several winners ignored his advice completely (more on their speeches in a sec), but that didn't stop the British comedian going all out as he fronted the ceremony for the fifth and apparently final time.

Here are a few of his best jokes, along with five other highlights from this year's ceremony.

1. Ricky Gervais reclaimed his throne

Image copyright Getty Images

When Ricky Gervais first hosted the Globes in 2010, his cutting comments and sarcastic style was a master class in ridiculing celebrities and set a blueprint for the ceremony's future hosts.

This year, he sensibly pre-empted the inevitable social media outrage over his politically incorrect gags by telling the audience: ""Remember, they're just jokes. We're all going to die soon, and there's no sequel.""

Here are a few of his best:

""I came here in a limo tonight and the licence plate was made by Felicity Huffman.""

""Martin Scorsese said the Marvel films remind him of theme parks. I don't know what he's doing hanging around theme parks - he's not big enough to go on the rides.""

""Knives Out has three nominations tonight. See what can happen when you don't dress people up as Cats?""

""We were going to do an In Memoriam section, but when I saw the list of people who had died this year, it wasn't diverse enough. It was mostly white people. And I thought, 'No, not on my watch.'""

""In a moment we're going to see a short clip from The Irishman. It's 88 minutes long.""

""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was nearly three hours long. Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere, and by the end his date was too old for him.""

""Lots of big celebrities here tonight. Legends. Icons. On the same table, there's Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Baby Yoda. Oh no, that's Joe Pesci, sorry.""

""Kevin Hart was fired from the Oscars for some offensive tweets. Luckily for me, the Hollywood Foreign Press can barely speak English and they've no idea what Twitter is, so I got offered this gig by fax.""

2. Ellen's acceptance speech poked fun at acceptance speeches

Image copyright Reuters

""The thing I like about this award is that coming in, I knew I was going win,"" joked talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as she accepted the Carol Burnett Award.

The prize recognises outstanding achievement in television and was only introduced as part of the ceremony last year.

DeGeneres, who was announced as the winner in advance, also made light of several acceptance speech tropes and clichés from the stage.

""I couldn't have done it without my husband Mark. Mark, you are my rock, thank you for supporting me through this crazy journey,"" she said to big laughs from the audience (which included her wife, Portia de Rossi).

""I know it wasn't easy for you or the kids - Rupert and Fiona, go to bed!"" she added, despite also not having any children.

""The important thing,"" she added on a more serious note, ""is that you all know me, and obviously you know me or else you wouldn't have laughed at all of that.

""I feel like we all think we know someone - there's a connection when we watch them on TV... Television inspired and influenced everything that I am today.""

3. Tom Hanks got emotional. Possibly because he had a cold

Image copyright Getty Images

The prestigious Cecil B DeMille Award - effectively the night's outstanding contribution prize - was given to awards season veteran and general legend Tom Hanks.

He told the audience he was feeling ""a little jittery"" because of how much orange juice he'd been drinking to try and get over a cold he'd had over the weekend.

Being ill turned out to be quite convenient, because when he became teary during his speech, he told the crowd: ""It's the cold that is making this happen. I swear to God, I'm not nearly this emotional at home.""

Paying tribute to his wife and children, he said: ""A man is blessed with a family sitting down front like that. A wife who has taught me what love is. Five kids who are wiser and braver than their old man is. I can't tell you how much your love means to me.""

And before he left, a provided a quick lesson in etiquette and punctuality for budding actors.

""Showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie,"" he said, to much applause.

""Those people with radios in their ears don't need to knock on your doors and say 'they're ready for you' because you're already ready. You have the freedom to settle down, because when the time comes, you have to hit the marks.""

4. One director championed subtitles (while also breaking a record)

Image copyright Getty Images

Parasite was widely considered to be one of the best films of last year - but because it's not in the English language, it wasn't eligible for nomination in the major categories.

Instead, the South Korean black comedy thriller was named the winner of best foreign language film, becoming the first ever Korean movie to triumph in the category.

Its director Bong Joon-ho used his acceptance speech to encourage the public not to be put off by international films.

""Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you'll be introduced to so many amazing films,"" he said through a translator.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ocean's 8 star Awkwafina was recognised for her role in The Farewell

""Just being nominated along with fellow amazing international film-makers was a huge honour. I think we use only one language: the cinema.""

It wasn't the only ""first ever"" of the ceremony.

Hildur Gudnadottir became the first solo woman to win best score for her work on Joker, while The Farewell's Awkwafina was the first woman of Asian descent to win best lead actress in a comedy or musical.

5. Several winners ignored Ricky's advice

Image copyright Reuters

In other words, they used their speeches to make political statements.

Some actors, including Australians Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, made reference to the bushfire crisis, connecting it with climate change.

On the subject of climate change, best drama actor winner Joaquin Phoenix praised the HFPA for only serving vegan meals to stars at the ceremony.

""I'd like to thank the HFPA for recognising and acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change,"" he said.

""It was a very bold move making tonight plant-based, and it really sends a powerful message.""

Sir Sam Mendes paid tribute to his grandfather, who fought in World War I, adding that he ""fervently hopes [a world war] never, ever happens again"".

The winner of best actress in a limited series, Michelle Williams, made a feminist speech, telling the audience: ""I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making... and I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose.""

And Patricia Arquette, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, made reference to the forthcoming US presidential election.

""While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world for our kids and their kids. We have to vote in 2020,"" she said.

6. Brad Pitt was the real Joker of the night

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio co-star in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

Brad Pitt was clearly in a playful mood as he arrived on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony.

One journalist told him: ""Everybody is waiting for you and Jennifer [Aniston, his ex-wife] to run into each other so they can take their picture.""

Pitt replied: ""I'll run into Jen, she's a good friend,"" before joking that it would be ""the second most important reunion of her year"" after the rumoured Friends HBO special.

Later in the night, Pitt introduced a clip of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood alongside his co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio.

""When I asked Quentin [Tarantino] how he wanted us to play two ageing movie guys who were on their way out, he said 'just be yourselves',"" Pitt joked.

Finally, as he was accepting his prize for best supporting actor, Pitt paid tribute to his co-star while poking fun at one of DiCaprio's earliest acting roles.

""He's an all-star, he's a gent, and I wouldn't be here without you man, thank you,"" Pitt said.

Referring to DiCaprio's on-screen death in Titanic, he concluded: ""I would have shared the raft.""

Actor Russell Crowe has used his winner's speech at the Golden Globes to raise awareness of the deadly bushfire crisis in Australia.

""Make no mistake. The tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based,"" he said in a message read out on stage by show host Jennifer Aniston.

Crowe won the award for his portrayal of Fox News Chief Executive Roger Ailes in The Loudest Voice in the Room.

His comments join a wave of celebrity support for the fire response.

At least 24 people have died since the fires began in September.

The fires are a natural part of the Australian weather cycle, but have been worsened this year by hotter-than-average temperatures and a persistent drought in many areas.

Crowe is one of thousands of Australian residents whose homes have been lost or damaged by the bushfires, which are affecting every state and territory.

""We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is,"" he said in his message.

Crowe was not at the Golden Globes ceremony in Hollywood - Aniston said he had stayed at home to protect his family.

He has been posting regularly on social media since the fires began, about the damage to his home but also encouraging donations to the largely volunteer fire services.

His latest video showed his Golden Globe alongside his firefighting equipment.

Actress Cate Blanchett also paid tribute at the ceremony to the largely volunteer firefighting operation, saying: ""When one country is facing a climate disaster, we are all facing a climate disaster.""

And Joaquin Phoenix, who won best actor in a drama for The Joker, called on Hollywood to ""get unified and make some changes"" on climate change.

Sports and celebrity donations

The Golden Globe speeches are part of a surge of celebrity activism over the past week, as the scale of the crisis has become more known internationally.

Scores of actors, singers and sports stars - Australian or otherwise - have donated to help the victims of the fires or are encouraging others to do so.

Australian actress Margot Robbie shared an emotional appeal on Instagram on Monday showing pictures of her childhood to show ""how beautiful our country is"".

""It is so beautiful and it's really hurting right now,"" she said, while calling for her followers to give to various charities ""to give future generations the kind of childhood I was so lucky to have"".

Prominent Australian writers have also joined forces under the #AuthorsForFireys hashtag on Twitter, auctioning off personalised pieces of writing, workshops, illustrations or coaching in exchange for donations.

In the sports world, Australian world number one tennis player Ashleigh Barty said on Sunday that she would donate all her prize money from the upcoming Brisbane Open to the relief fund.

Five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova says she plans to donate an initial A$25,000 and asked men's world number two Novak Djokovic to match it.

Earlier, Australian player Nick Kyrgios said he would donate A$200 for every ace he hits during the tournament.

Donations have also been pledged by Australian actress Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban, and by the singer Pink, who said on Saturday she was ""totally devastated"".

Comedian Celeste Barber, who found fame through recreating celebrity Instagram pictures, launched an appeal through her account at the weekend which has already raised more than A$31m.

She shared an image of her mother-in-law's home, saying: ""It's terrifying. They are scared.""

Kim Kardashian-West, who has nearly 63 million followers on Twitter, tweeted a string of news articles about the fires on 3 January, followed by the message: ""Climate change is real"", while Selena Gomez, with more than 59 million followers on Twitter, also called for donations.

Christine Keeler was just 19 when she became embroiled in a sex scandal that would bring down the British government. Not only was she vilified at the time, but the affair stalked her throughout her life. For the first time, a new drama reappraises her character by telling the story through her eyes, writes Tanya Gold.

The Profumo Affair, with its ingredients of sex, aristocrats and espionage, was a scandal so perfect it remains one of the most enduring in modern British political history. It is also a story that is often remembered as an overture to the Swinging Sixties - a tale of sexual liberation and hope, but one in which everyone who took part was punished.

It was 1961 in London and 19-year-old model Christine Keeler was sleeping with both John Profumo, 46, the Conservative Secretary of State for War, and Yevgeny Ivanov, 31, a naval attaché at the Soviet embassy, and a spy. Keeler's enabler was her friend Stephen Ward, an osteopath and amateur artist who moved in aristocratic circles and introduced her to both men.

After the affair was exposed, Profumo resigned, Keeler went to prison for perjury and Ward took his own life. The following year, Harold Macmillan's Conservative government fell - the Profumo Affair had exacerbated its rot. It is now dramatised, in minute detail, in a six-part BBC series The Trial of Christine Keeler by screenwriter and novelist Amanda Coe. Sophie Cookson stars as Keeler, Ben Miles plays Profumo and James Norton, Ward.

Unlike Michael Caton-Jones's 1989 film Scandal, which focuses on Ward (John Hurt) and is over-jolly for the subject matter, Coe prefers to concentrate on Keeler herself.

""The story had never been told from the point of view of the woman at the centre of it,"" says Coe.

Image caption Ben Miles as John Profumo and Sophie Cookson as Christine Keeler

Who was Keeler? Superficially, a series of archetypes, and that is surely why she fascinated. You can project anything onto an archetype who is usually portrayed, as Coe says, as ""a dead-eyed siren"". Prime Minister Harold Macmillan called her a ""tart"", while Ward always called her his ""little baby"". Ward was fantasising about Keeler's compliance, and Macmillan was merely wrong.

Keeler, who died in 2017, was never a prostitute. She was something more interesting and complex - a young woman who liked sex in an era when good girls didn't, or at least they pretended that they didn't. And so, Keeler became an unfortunate cipher for sexual promise when repression was a national disease. The term ""prostitute"" is merely a guilty slur.

Later, for anyone who still cared, she was an object of pity, occasionally photographed by the tabloids as she tried and failed to thrive after the scandal, her famous beauty gone and with it, her small power.

Image copyright Mirrorpix/ Getty Images Image caption Christine Keeler shortly before her trial

Keeler was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in an unhappy and impoverished home - a house made from two converted railway carriages. Her father abandoned her mother during World War Two, and at one point, Keeler was removed from her mother when it was discovered the child was suffering from malnutrition.

Keeler had the complex gift of beauty, and men used her for it. Her stepfather, she reveals in her memoir Secrets and Lies, assaulted her when she was 12 and asked her to run away with him because he did not love her mother. Local fathers assaulted her when she babysat their children. She left school at 15 without qualifications and became pregnant by an American serviceman. She apparently tried to abort the child herself, but failed, and it died at six days old. In the 1950s, there was no pity for young women who suffered as Keeler did, but there was much reproach.

Image copyright Bob Hope / Getty Images Image caption Secretary of State for War John Profumo at Sandown Park Racecourse in 1963

She ran away to London and became a show girl at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho, dancing topless for £8.50 a week. It was here that she met Stephen Ward. We might presume now that she was still suffering from the early neglect, the assaults and the death of her child - certainly Sophie Cookson plays Keeler as unknowable and untouchable.

Ward was from a bourgeois background - his father was a Torquay vicar - and he loved to court aristocrats. He also enjoyed the company of working-class girls like Keeler. She became one of his protégées, and while he never slept with her, he did take her to orgies and eased her into love affairs that would benefit him socially. She was his living, breathing toy. He groomed her - although in Coe's telling and James Norton's tender and bewildered performance, Ward, too, is vulnerable - a man on the outside looking in. Perhaps this is what bound him and Keeler together.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stephen Ward at one of his art exhibitions

Lord Astor, who slept with Keeler's friend Mandy Rice-Davies, allowed Ward to rent a cottage in the grounds of Cliveden, his country home. It was there in July 1961, while swimming naked in a pool in a walled garden, that Keeler met the 5th Baron Profumo, who was married to the fêted actress Valerie Hobson. She says he chased her, trying to remove her towel.

They had an affair, but it lasted only months.

Why did she do it? I suspect that after her youthful experiences of abandonment and betrayal, she wanted to please men, and Ward in particular, since he noticed her and appeared to cherish his ""little baby"". Was it easier to say yes, and to do what they wanted - since it was all they wanted? Keeler's testimony about Profumo suggests that tenderness from men could move her: ""I enjoyed it,"" she wrote of the sex, ""for he was kind and loving afterwards"".

Image copyright Bettmann / Getty Images Image caption John Profumo with his actress wife, Valerie Hobson after resigning from his post

But not everyone was ""kind and loving"" in this context. There were many beatings for a beautiful girl who liked sex. She was involved with Jamaican jazz singer Aloysius ""Lucky"" Gordon, who raped her and held her hostage; it was that affair that exposed the wider scandal, and led to her prison sentence. Keeler had already left Gordon when he was wounded in a fight with Johnny Edgecombe - another of her lovers. Edgecombe stalked Keeler to Ward's flat in Wimpole Mews, central London, in December 1962 and fired gunshots at the front door. The police were called, the press was alerted, and the Profumo Affair began to unravel.

Image caption Sophie Cookson as Christine Keeler, with Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as boyfriend Johnny Edgecombe

Just two years earlier, the Portland Spy Ring had been uncovered, leading to the conviction of five people for passing secrets to Russia. Now, the confection of espionage (Keeler had been sleeping with a Russian spy), sex, aristocracy and race - Edgecombe and Gordon were both of West Indian descent - was irresistible. Keeler, from anger and naivety, sold her story to the newspapers and became famous and reviled at the same time.

""Lucky"" Gordon was jailed for assault, but when Keeler withdrew her testimony, she was imprisoned for perjury. Ward, meanwhile, was punished with a spurious accusation of living off the immoral earnings of prostitutes. In fact, Keeler and Rice-Davies, who had both lived with him, had merely contributed to the telephone bills and repaid money he had lent them. But the order was given to Scotland Yard to ""get Ward"" and they obeyed. Memories are long. A submission to review the conviction in 2017 was denied; the official material is sealed until 2046.

The wreckage of the affair was cast far and wide. No-one escaped uninjured, except Ward's aristocratic friends, who promptly - and inevitably - dropped him. Towards the end of his trial, Ward took an overdose of barbiturates. He died three days later. Profumo resigned from the government when it was revealed that he lied to the House of Commons about his affair with Keeler. He spent the rest of his life as a volunteer at an east London charity called Toynbee Hall.

Image copyright Evening Standard / Getty Images Image caption Christine Keeler, October 1963

However, his CBE from Elizabeth II in 1975 signalled society's forgiveness, and he was invited to Margaret Thatcher's 70th birthday party, where he was seated next to the Queen. Lord Longford said he felt more admiration for Profumo than ""all the men I've known in my lifetime"". In this reading, Profumo remains, eternally, Keeler's victim, and the obituaries after he died in 2006 were kind. Misogyny dies hard.

For Keeler, there was no such redemption - at least, perhaps, until now, when in Coe's telling, she can step out from behind her archetypes and be seen as whole and with agency.

The scandal stalked her throughout her life, particularly after her own sexuality entered the national culture and became part of it - her portrait, by Ward, a talented amateur artist, is owned by the National Portrait Gallery.

She was poorly educated but not stupid, and when she said, ""I took on the sins of everybody, of a generation, really"", it feels true.

Image caption Sophie Cookson playing Christine Keeler and Ellie Bamber playing Mandy Rice-Davies

So, it is gratifying that Coe, in detailing her story so precisely, makes Keeler so human - a young woman who walked blithely through life and made mistakes, for which she paid too high a price. Nor does Coe keep Keeler forever entombed in 1963, the year of her infamy, and the year that she posed for a portrait that has become one of the defining images of the decade.

In the photo, an apparently naked Keeler straddles a chair which has been positioned with its back to the camera.

According to Coe, Keeler had been adamant in later interviews that she had refused to pose naked - that she had in fact worn knickers for the photo, and had pulled them out of the way of the shot.

The ""naked"" Keeler is just another myth, she says - another example of how she has been misrepresented.

The final scene of The Trial of Christine Keeler looks forwards from that 1963 moment - it has her dancing in a reverie, with closed eyes and upturned arms.

The Trial of Christine Keeler continues on Monday 30 December and then on Sunday nights at 21:00 on BBC One.",In search of the real Christine Keeler,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50858880,2019-12-30T00:10:07
"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition to vaccination is as old as the process - as are fears of its side effects

The distrust of doctors and government that feeds the anti-vaccination movement might be seen as a modern phenomenon, but the roots of today's activism were put down well over a century ago.

In the late 19th Century, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to compulsory smallpox vaccinations. There were arrests, fines and people were even sent to jail.

Banners were brandished demanding ""Repeal the Vaccination Acts, the curse of our nation"" and vowing ""Better a felon's cell than a poisoned babe"". Copies of hated laws were burned in the streets and the effigy was lynched of the humble country doctor who was seen as to blame for the smallpox prevention programme.

Warning - this story contains graphic images

At the height of this fight, the people of Leicester, a city in the English Midlands, claimed to have found an alternative to vaccination - and it's an approach that is still quoted by campaigners today.

The shockwaves from this storm of anti-establishment anger went far beyond the streets of Leicester and the group behind it, formed 150 years ago.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The ""speckled monster"" - shown on this preserved foot - had devastated entire cultures

Smallpox, called the ""speckled monster"" due to its distinctive blister-like rashes, had killed millions since medieval times.

At one stage it was the single biggest cause of death in Europe, killing 400,000 every year. In the Americas it ravaged native tribes and entire cultures collapsed.

A third of survivors were blinded. Almost all who did not die were scarred for life.

So why did a cheap and apparently effective solution - vaccination - threaten to tear society apart?

Image copyright Global Freedom Movement Image caption One anti-vax website cites ""The City of Leicester: Sanitation Trumps Vaccination"" as one of its ""5 Historical Vaccine Scandals""

The story starts in 1798 with Gloucestershire doctor Edward Jenner successfully testing the country-lore that a dose of relatively mild cowpox infection gave protection from smallpox.

Within five years, Jenner's discovery was being used across Europe and a decade later it had gone global.

But opposition was swift and savage.

Image copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption In this cartoon, vaccination was depicted as a diseased cow-like monster being fed children

""This came from a variety of angles - sanitary, religious, scientific and political,"" said medical historian Dr Kristin Hussey.

""Some felt the method - using material from cows - was unhealthy or unchristian, using matter from lower creatures.

""Some disputed smallpox was passed from person to person, but many simply objected to being told what was good for them.""

Image caption There were many and varied ways to die in London in 1801 and doctors seemingly had few answers

There followed a 100-year battle between the authorities and an often sceptical, sometimes aggressive, public.

In Britain, a succession of laws made vaccinations free, then compulsory - backed by fines and even imprisonment. While riots flared in some towns, there was also more restrained opposition in the form of anti-vaccination leagues.

For an increasingly literate population, pamphlets were produced with titles like ""Vaccination: its fallacies and evils"", ""Vaccination, a Curse"" and the suitably Gothic ""Horrors of Vaccination"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The slums of the Industrial Revolution were a breeding ground for disease

Dr Hussey said: ""In modern terms, it was a very 'woke' time.

""People were asking questions about rights, especially working-class rights. There was a sense the upper classes were trying to take advantage, a feeling of distrust.

""This was a move into an area of people's private lives, their health, which had not been governed before.

""And vaccines were not as safe as they are now - people did become seriously ill and even died. If I was alive at the time I would have been wary of vaccinations too.""

Supporters pointed to falling death rates and milder occurrences of the disease, while opponents highlighted continued outbreaks and the appalling side effects of vaccination, such as abscesses and cross infections.

Victorian medicine

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There was no regulation of doctors until 1851 and quacks were a standing joke in society

Never was the lie of ""the good old days"" more clear than in medicine.

The 1841 UK census suggested a third of doctors were unqualified. An 1848 medical book claimed common causes of illness were ""diseased parents"", night air, sedentary habits, wet feet and abrupt changes of temperature.

It stated cholera, a scourge of Victorian society, was caused by rancid food, ""cold fruits"" like cucumbers and melons, and passionate fear or rage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Street remedies were sometimes the only option open for the poor

In 1850 the average life expectancy was not much above 40 years, and 15% of children died before the age of one.

The 1858 Medical Act brought in standards and registration but this was at a time when the majority of professionals still believed bad air - miasma - caused many illnesses.

Germ theory - that microscopic organisms invading the body can cause disease - was not widely accepted until the 1880s.

Alongside qualified medics were the quacks and traditional healers - and without a health service, everyone charged for their services, excluding many from all but the most basic care.

At this point, immunisation was still in its infancy and naturally produced cowpox material varied in quality.

What is more, it took decades to realise vaccination failed to give lifelong immunity, while clumsy procedures could lead to secondary infections, such as syphilis, hepatitis and tuberculosis.

The Leicester Anti-Vaccination League was set up in 1869 but the approach that would be lauded by those opposed to vaccination came in 1877, ironically enough, from the medical establishment.

The city medical examiner made it compulsory to report cases of smallpox. He would then isolate the patient, quarantine family and disinfect - and sometimes burn - belongings.

Originally designed to work alongside vaccination, the League promoted it as an alternative and the ""Leicester method"" sparked growing defiance.

1885 - Mass protest held in Leicester

1898 - Vaccination Act introduces ""conscientious objection"" clause

Science writer Jason ""The Germ Guy"" Tetro sees powerful echoes in today's controversy.

""We tend to hear civil rights as a major factor in detractors' arguments,"" he said. ""They feel the government is imposing too many restrictions on their liberties by invoking mandatory vaccinations.

""This is similar to what was heard in Leicester. However, the resolution back then happened to be the removal of individual rights for the sake of the population.

""That was the law. I am not sure how that would go over in today's world.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The mid 19th Century was a time of political and social protest

In Leicester the number of prosecutions for non-vaccination grew from two in 1869 to 1,154 in 1881 and about 3,000 in 1884.

Figures for the second half of 1883 showed in Leicester, of 2,281 births only 707 babies were vaccinated.

Court cases provided incendiary publicity for the anti-vax movement.

In March 1884, resident George Bamford told magistrates his three eldest children had been vaccinated. Two had been confined to bed for days and a third had died.

For refusing to vaccinate his fourth child, he was ordered to pay 10 shillings - half the average weekly wage - or spend seven days in prison.

Fines were fiercely enforced. Police collecting a fine from one Arthur Ward threatened his pregnant wife with prison. The argument sent her into premature labour and the child was stillborn.

Image copyright Jenner Trust Image caption Brothers, one vaccinated, one not, were pictured in the Leicester smallpox isolation hospital

In October 1884 the Leicester Board of Guardians asked the London authorities for an easing of prosecutions, in the light of the Leicester method. The request was rejected, setting the stage for the city's mass protest of 1885.

Although peaceful, the scale of the demonstration shook the establishment. Medical professionals feared for the unvaccinated city, predicting ""a terrible nemesis would overtake it in the shape of a disastrous epidemic"".

Smallpox duly returned between 1892 and 1894. And the result shocked many.

Image copyright Wellcome Trust Image caption An unvaccinated smallpox victim in Gloucester in 1896. He survived - dozens did not

Leicester actually escaped relatively lightly, with 370 cases - a rate of 20.5 cases per 10,000 of the population - resulting in 21 deaths. This was a far lower figure of cases than in some well-vaccinated towns like Warrington (125) and Sheffield (144).

Anti-vaccinationists were triumphant, claiming the Leicester method had been proven.

Mr Tetro said: ""The so-called marvellous success of the Leicester method was based on the fact it used a tried and true method of notification and quarantine in combination with the benefit of a hospital and the use of a type of ring vaccination in which healthcare staff were vaccinated.

""In a small population, this can work but as the population grows, this method becomes untenable.

""This was seen in 1893 when people had to resort to staying at home instead of being cared for in a hospital during an epidemic that led to hundreds of infections.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A global vaccination programme saw smallpox declared eradicated by the 1970s

The flip side was that in London - where vaccination was widespread - there was success in containing smallpox, with 5.5 cases per 10,000 people. And some poorly vaccinated places, like Dewsbury (339 cases) and Gloucester (501), were badly hit.

And Leicester had the highest proportion of cases - more than two thirds - in under 10s.

Nonetheless, the headlines and protests, along with a growing understanding of how diseases spread, resulted in significant change.

In 1898 a new Vaccination Act introduced a clause allowing people to opt out for moral reasons - the first time ""conscientious objection"" was recognised in UK law.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition to vaccinations has endured despite overwhelming medical evidence of their success

The following year, notification of various infectious diseases, including smallpox, became compulsory. And while smallpox returned to Britain in the early 20th Century, it never carried the same threat.

As the use of vaccines spread - along with improved sanitation - smallpox was pushed out of Europe and North America.

A World Health Organization (WHO) global eradication programme was launched in 1959 and intensified in 1967. Apart from a death linked to a Birmingham laboratory, the last case was recorded in Somalia in 1977.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption The Leicester method is regularly quoted in vaccine debates on social media

However, opposition to vaccines - questioning their efficiency and safety - continues. Some campaigners hold up the Leicester method as evidence society can cope without such intervention.

Alarm bells were sounded recently with the news that routine vaccinations for under-fives fell last year.

Compulsory vaccination is still bitterly debated. Parts of the medical profession, such as the Royal College of Paediatrics, believe it would be counterproductive and make people more suspicious.

Earlier this year, the WHO declared ""vaccine hesitancy"" as one of the top 10 threats to global health.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People queuing for smallpox vaccination in Niger 1969

Owen Gower, the manager of the Jenner's House Museum, reflected on the country doctor's legacy.

""Countless deaths and incidences of the severe scarring and blindness that the disease could cause have been averted, thanks to Jenner's discovery and his determination to tell the world about it.

It's four decades since a charismatic preacher and his followers staged an armed takeover of the Grand Mosque of Mecca and the holiest place in Islam became a killing field. The resulting siege, writes the BBC's Eli Melki, shook the Muslim world to its foundations and changed the course of Saudi history.

In the early hours of 20 November 1979, some 50,000 faithful from all over the world gathered for dawn prayers in the huge courtyard surrounding the sacred Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest place. Among them mingled 200 men led by a charismatic 40-year-old preacher called Juhayman al-Utaybi.

As, the imam finished leading prayers, Juhayman and his followers pushed him aside and seized the microphone.

They had placed closed coffins in the centre of the yard, a traditional act of seeking blessings for the recently deceased. But when the coffins were opened, they revealed handguns and rifles, which were quickly distributed among the men.

One of them began to read a prepared speech: ""Fellow Muslims, we announce today the coming of the Mahdi… who shall reign with justice and fairness on Earth after it has been filled with injustice and oppression.""

For the pilgrims in the courtyard, this was an extraordinary announcement. In the hadiths - reports of what the Prophet Muhammad said or approved - the coming of the Mahdi, or divinely guided one, is foretold. He is described as a man endowed with extraordinary powers by God, and some Muslims believe he will usher in an era of justice and true belief.

The preacher, Khaled al-Yami, a follower of Juhayman, claimed that ""countless visions have testified to the coming of the Mahdi"". Hundreds of Muslims had seen him in their dreams, Yami said, and now he was in their midst. The Mahdi's name was Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Qahtani.

In an audio recording of the speech, Juhayman can be heard interrupting the speaker from time to time to direct his men to close the shrine's gates and take up sniper positions in its tall minarets, which then dominated the city of Mecca.

''Attention brothers! Ahmad al-Lehebi, go up on the roof. If you see someone resisting at the gates, shoot them!''

According to an anonymous witness, Juhayman was the first to pay homage to the Mahdi, and immediately others started following his example. Cries of ""God is great!"" rang out.

But there was confusion too. Abdel Moneim Sultan, an Egyptian religious student who had got to know some of Juhayman's followers, recalls that the Grand Mosque was full of foreign visitors who spoke little Arabic and did not know what was happening.

Image caption Abdel Moneim Sultan, a student in 1979, was a witness to the events

The sight of armed gunmen in a space in which the Koran strictly forbids any violence, and a few gunshots, also stunned many worshippers, who scrambled to reach any exits still left open.

''People were surprised at the sight of gunmen... This is something they were not used to. There is no doubt this horrified them. This was something outrageous,'' says Abdel Moneim Sultan.

But in just an hour the audacious takeover was complete. The armed group was now in full control of the Grand Mosque, mounting a direct challenge to the authority of the Saudi royal family.

The men who took over the Grand Mosque belonged to an association called al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Muhtasiba (JSM) which condemned what it perceived as the degeneration of social and religious values in Saudi Arabia.

Flush with oil money, the country was gradually transforming into a consumerist society. Cars and electrical goods were becoming commonplace, the country was urbanising, and in some regions men and women began to mix in public.

But the JSM's members continued to live an austere life, proselytising, studying the Koran and the hadiths, and adhering to the tenets of Islam as defined by the Saudi religious establishment.

Juhayman, one of the JSM's founders - who hailed from Sajir, a Bedouin settlement in the centre of the country - confessed to his followers that his past was far from perfect. During a long evening around a fireplace in the desert, or a gathering in the house of one of his supporters, he would tell his personal story of fall and redemption to a captivated audience.

Usama al-Qusi, a religious student who frequented the group's meetings, heard Juhayman say that he had been involved in ""illegal trading, including drug smuggling"".

However, he had repented, found solace in religion and became a zealous and devoted leader - and many members of the JSM, especially the younger ones, fell under his spell.

Most of those who knew him, such as religious student Mutwali Saleh, attest of his force of personality as well as his devotion: ""Nobody saw this man and didn't like him. He was strange. He had what is called charisma. He was true to his mission, and he gave his whole life to Allah, day and night.""

However, for a religious leader he was poorly educated.

""Juhayman was keen to go to the isolated and the rural areas where Bedouins live,"" Nasser al-Hozeimi, a close follower, recalls. ""Because his classical Arabic [the language mastered by all scholars of Islam] was weak and he had a strong Bedouin accent, he avoided addressing any educated audience to avoid being exposed.""

On the other hand, Juhayman had served as a soldier in the National Guard, and his rudimentary military training proved important when it came to organising the takeover.

Eventually, the JSM began to clash with some Saudi clerics and a crackdown by the authorities ensued.

Juhayman fled to the desert, where he wrote a series of pamphlets criticising the Saudi royal family for what he considered it to be its decadence, and accusing clerics of colluding with it for earthly gains. He became convinced that Saudi Arabia had been corrupted and that only a heavenly intervention could bring salvation.

It was at this point that he identified the Mahdi as Mohammad Bin Abdullah al-Qahtani, a soft-spoken young preacher known for his good manners, devotion and poetry.

The hadiths talk of a Mahdi with a first name and father's name similar to the prophet's, and features outlined by a large forehead and a pronounced thin, aquiline nose. Juhayman saw all of this in al-Qahtani, but the supposed saviour himself was taken aback by the idea. Overwhelmed, he retreated into prayer.

Eventually, however, he emerged from his isolation convinced that Juhayman was right. He took on the role of Mahdi, and the alliance with Juhayman was sealed all the more tightly when Qahtani's older sister became Juhayman's second wife.

Conveniently, a few months before the siege, strange rumours spread that hundreds of Meccans and pilgrims had seen al-Qahtani in their dreams, standing tall in the Grand Mosque and holding the banner of Islam.

Juhayman's followers were convinced. Mutwali Saleh, a member of the JSM, recalls: ""I remember the last meeting when a brother asked me, 'Brother Mutwali, what do you think about the Mahdi?' I said to him, 'Excuse me please, don't talk about this subject.' Then someone said to me, 'You are a silent devil. Brother, the Mahdi is real and he is Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Qahtani.'""

In the remote areas where he had sought refuge, Juhayman and his followers began to prepare for the violent conflict to come.

The Saudi leadership reacted sluggishly to the seizure of the Grand Mosque.

Crown Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz al-Saud was in Tunisia at the Arab League summit and Prince Abdullah, head of the National Guard - an elite security force tasked with protecting royal leaders - was in Morocco. It was left to the ailing King Khaled and Defence Minister Prince Sultan to co-ordinate a response.

The Saudi police at first failed to understand the scale of the problem and sent a couple of patrol cars to investigate, but as they drove up to the Grand Mosque they came under a hail of bullets.

Once the gravity of the situation became clear, units of the National Guard launched a hasty effort to retake control of the shrine.

Mark Hambley, a political officer at the US embassy in Jeddah and one of the few Westerners who were aware of the situation, says this assault was brave but naïve. ""They were immediately shot down,"" he says. ""The sharp-shooters had very good weapons, very good calibre Belgian rifles.""

It became clear that the insurgents had planned their attack in detail and would not be easy to dislodge. A security cordon was established around the Grand Mosque, and special forces, paratroopers and armoured units were called in.

Religious student Abdel Moneim Sultan, who was trapped inside, says clashes intensified from after noon on the second day. ''I saw artillery fire directed towards the minarets, and I saw helicopters hovering constantly in the air, and I also saw military airplanes,"" he remembers.

The Grand Mosque is a vast building consisting mainly of galleries and corridors, hundreds of meters long, surrounding the Kaaba's courtyard, and built on two floors. During the next two days, the Saudi units launched frontal assaults in an effort to gain entrance. But the rebels repelled wave after wave of attacks, despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered.

Abdel Moneim Sultan recalls that Juhayman appeared supremely confident and relaxed when they met near the Kaaba that day. ""He slept for half an hour or 45 minutes resting his head on my leg, while his wife stood by. She never left his side,"" he says.

The rebels lit fires with carpets and rubber tires to generate heavy clouds of smoke, then they hid behind columns before stepping out of the dark to ambush emerging Saudi troops. The building was turned into a killing zone, and the casualties quickly rose into the hundreds.

""This was a man-to-man confrontation, within a limited space,"" says Maj Mohammad al-Nufai, the commander of the Ministry of Interior's special forces. ""A combat situation with bullets whizzing by, left and right - it's something unbelievable.""

A fatwa issued by the Kingdom's main clerics, assembled by King Khaled, cleared the Saudi military to use any degree of force to expel the rebels. Anti-tank guided missiles and heavy guns were then employed to dislodge the rebels from the minarets, and armoured personnel carriers were sent in to breach the gates.

The rebels were galvanised by the Mahdi. ""I saw him with two minor injuries under his eyes and his thowb (his dress) was riddled with holes from gunshots,"" says Abdel Moneim Sultan. ""He believed that he could expose himself anywhere out of the conviction that he was immortal - he was the Mahdi, after all.""

But Qahtani's belief in his own invulnerability was unfounded and he was soon struck by gunfire.

Image caption Mark Hambley: The Saudis pushed the rebels deeper into the catacombs

""When he was hit, people started to shout: 'The Mahdi is injured, the Mahdi is injured!' Some tried to run towards him to rescue him, but the heavy fire prevented them from doing this, and they had to retreat,"" the anonymous witness says.

They told Juhayman that the Mahdi had been hit, but he declared to his followers: ""Do not believe them. They are deserters!""

It was only on the sixth day of fighting that the Saudi security forces managed to take control of the courtyard of the mosque and the buildings surrounding it. But the remaining rebels merely retreated to a labyrinth of hundreds of rooms and cells underneath, convinced by Juhayman that the Mahdi was still alive, somewhere in the building.

Their situation was now dire, though. ""The smells surrounded us from the dead or the injuries that had rotted,"" says the anonymous witness. ""In the beginning, water was available, but later on they started to ration supplies. Then the dates ran out so they started eating balls of raw dough... It was a terrifying atmosphere. It was like you were in a horror movie.""

Although the Saudi government issued one communiqué after the other announcing victory, the absence of prayers broadcast to the Islamic world told another story. ""The Saudis tried tactic after tactic, and it didn't work,"" says Hambley. ""It was pushing the rebels deeper and deeper into the catacombs.""

It was clear the Saudi government needed help to capture the leaders alive and put an end to the siege. They turned to French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.

""Our ambassador told me that it was obvious the Saudi forces were very disorganised and didn't know how to react,"" Giscard d'Estaing tells the BBC, confirming for the first time France's role in this crisis.

Image caption Valéry Giscard d'Estaing

""It seemed to me to be dangerous, because of the weakness of the system, its unpreparedness and the repercussions this could have on the global oil market.""

The French president discreetly dispatched three advisers from the recently formed counter-terror unit, GIGN. The operation had to remain secret, to avoid any criticism of Western intervention in the birthplace of Islam.

The French team was headquartered in a hotel in the nearby town of Taif, from where it devised a plan to flush out the rebels - the basements would be filled with gas, to render the air unbreathable.

Image caption The French commandos, Paul Barril on the left

""Holes were dug every 50m in order to reach the basement,"" says Capt Paul Barril, who was in charge of executing the operation. ""Gas was injected through these holes. The gas was dispersed with the help of grenade explosions into every corner where the rebels were hiding.""

For the anonymous witness, holed up down in the basement with the last of the resisting rebels, the world seemed to be coming to an end.

""The feeling was as though death had come to us, because you didn't know whether this was the sound of digging or of a rifle, it was a terrifying situation.''

The French plan proved successful.

""Juhayman ran out of ammunition and food in the last two days,"" says Nasser al-Hozeimi, one of his followers. ""They were gathered in a small room and the soldiers were throwing smoke bombs on them through a hole they made in the ceiling... That's why they surrendered. Juhayman left and all of them followed.""

Maj Nufai witnessed the meeting that followed, between the Saudi princes and a stunned but unrepentant Juhayman: ""Prince Saud al-Faisal asked him: 'Why, Juhayman?' He answered: 'It's only fate.' 'Do you need anything?' He just said: 'I want some water.'""

Juhayman was paraded before the cameras, and just over a month later 63 of the rebels were publicly executed in eight cities across Saudi Arabia. Juhayman was the first to die.

While Juhayman's belief in the Mahdi may have set him apart, he was part of a wider movement of social and religious conservatism reacting against modernity, in which hardline clerics gained the upper hand over the royal family.

One man on whom the siege had a profound effect was Osama Bin Laden. In one of his pamphlets against the Saudi ruling family, he said they had ""desecrated the Haram, when this crisis could have been solved peacefully"". He went on: ""I still remember to this day the traces of their tracks on the Haram's floor tiles.""

""Juhayman's actions stopped all modernisation,"" Nasser al-Huzaimi says. ""Let me give you a simple example. One of the things he demanded from the Saudi government was the removal of female presenters from TV. After the Haram incident, no female presenter appeared on TV again.""

Saudi Arabia remained on this ultra-conservative path for most of the next four decades. Only recently have there been signs of a thaw.

In an interview in March 2018, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, said that before 1979, ""We were living a normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries, women were driving cars, there were movie theatres in Saudi Arabia.""

The government says school funding is at record levels, but Bellfield Junior School in Northfield, Birmingham, still finds it hard to make ends meet. Pastoral care is one of the big items on its budget, discovers the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby - care for children and sometimes for their families too.

Bellfield's head teacher, Nigel Attwood is doubled up over his desk, giggling and chortling while his deputy, Claire du Toit, stands over him, hand on hip as she tries to smother her own mirth and look cross.

""It wasn't me, it was the elf!"" Nigel grins, delighted with a prank he has successfully pulled off in Claire's classroom. She's laughing openly now and lifts her hands to me in a gesture of mock helplessness.

""I tell you,"" she says good-naturedly, ""it's a good job we can laugh here, isn't it?""

Image caption Claire du Toit

With its budgetary problems, temperamental boiler, draughty windows and many pupils in financial or family crisis, you might not imagine Bellfield Junior School could create such a happy space. Yet the staff here constantly recharge the atmosphere with their high spirits and sense of fun - and never more so than at Christmas time.

The children have already enjoyed Christmas Jumper Day, Pancakes with Santa, Silly Songs and a Special Christmas Dinner and now Year 5 are about to perform a nativity and carol concert to their families.

""It's a time of year when we can all be together in school and enjoy being together,"" explains Nigel, as we hurriedly drink coffee in his office before the bell rings. ""As much as Christmas is a time for families, we also find it's a time for us to be a family in school too - it's about being a community.""

Image caption Nigel Attwood

Bellfield is located in Northfield, a deprived area of Birmingham, where 60% of the 315 pupils are classed as disadvantaged.

""We know our parents struggle,"" adds Claire. ""And Christmas is a difficult time because there's high expectations for people to provide something special, and it's very difficult for them to do that. So, every way we can support them by doing some of it in school, well, we do!""

In the corridor, tea-towelled, antlered, winged or crown-sporting children scuff their plimsolls on the carpet and jiggle in excited anticipation as they wait their turn to file into the hall, some desperately trying to catch their parents' attention, others staring fixedly at the floor, solemnly mouthing their lines. A visiting toddler, breaking free from his mother's hand, catches sight of his big brother who is dressed as a sheep, and slumps star-struck on to the carpet, scattering his crisps.

Just behind the line-up, the light goes on in the Rainbow Room. In fact, the light is pretty much always on in the Rainbow Room. It's a sort of therapy room, adorned with sea life murals where a soothing soundscape of twittering birds comforts children in difficulty who need time out to talk. And there are always children here who need to talk.

When I visit in October, pastoral care manager, Jamie Neadle, and learning mentor Lorraine Harvey admit they are overwhelmed by the number of children who come to see them and by the seriousness of their problems. And mention the 60% of pupils here who receive ""pupil premium"", a grant given by the government to a school for each disadvantaged child it educates, and Jamie, who served 30 years as a plain talking policeman, will give you short shrift.

""Don't say 'pupil premium',"" he snaps. ""Say it as it is - free school meals. And what we're really saying is 60% of our parents can't afford to give their children a hot dinner.""

Over a quarter of children at Bellfield have special educational needs and disabilities and over a third are on the vulnerable register. Bellfield spends about £114,000 a year - that's about 7.5% of its annual budget - on pastoral care to help children overcome problems, so that they can concentrate better on learning.

""The problems we see in here range from emotional to pure mental health issues to violent and aggressive, destructive behaviours and to self-harming,"" says Jamie. ""Oh, we're talking seven and eight-year-olds self-harming,"" he explains, when he sees my astonished look. ""And they're not just playing at it, believe me, they're doing it for real.""

Lorraine has picked up one of the soft toy puppets she uses to help children express themselves in therapy sessions and is absent-mindedly stroking its head with her thumb while she listens to her colleague. She's been working at Bellfield Junior school for 18 years and says, very quietly, that the situation has got so much worse.

""There are so many children coming to us throughout the day now that we actually have to turn children away."" She focuses her eyes on the puppet.

""It's horrendous.""

Image caption Jamie Neadle

A thin little girl in tears has been knocking repeatedly at the door while we are talking, complaining bitterly about being left out of a playground game.

""Not now,"" says Jamie firmly. ""Go and find another adult. Go on - we're busy.""

The child persists, rattling the door handle until Lorraine goes out to comfort her. Jamie confesses she's a child they are deeply concerned about and not because of alleged bullying at school. His hands are balled into fists as he talks.

""There are children in this school who have walked across bare boards this morning,"" he tells me, nodding his head at the little girl on the other side of the door, who is now cuddled up to Lorraine.

Image caption Lorraine Harvey

""Children with no breakfast in their stomachs because there's no food and no carpet at home. And people think we're making it up. We're not. This is Britain. Britain in the 21st Century.""

Lorraine has now successfully despatched the distressed child back to class and she sits down heavily, sharing a despairing look with her colleague.

""Behaviour can be triggered by anything,"" she starts. ""But obviously if a child is hungry, they are going to behave in a classroom in a way that's not acceptable.""

She stares through the door into the empty corridor where the little girl had been standing.

""Some of our families are living in horrendous conditions,"" she sighs.

""Everything's gone up and they just can't cope with day-to-day living. I mean, a pair of decent school shoes is what, £40? So I think a lot of children are slipping through the net. There are just so many issues. And then we expect these children to come to school and function. Well, sorry, but how can they do that?""

Image caption Lorraine Harvey talks to a pupil in the Rainbow Room

At break time there are two distinct lines queuing to get into the hall - free toast on the right, or for those lucky few with a pound in their pocket, bacon butties or sausage sandwiches on the left. The line on the right snakes out of the hall door.

Jamie asks me to remember that most of the children's parents are working yet still rely on handouts.

""We've got to ask the question as a society, they're working and yet we have to give them extra money to survive. I mean, they're trying. You can't point the finger and say they're not trying. They're struggling.""

And with social and other support services stripped back to the core, the school now finds itself on the front line to deliver assistance, not just to the pupils but to their whole families. Parents regularly need debt counselling, help with parenting skills, or simply some emergency food shopping. It's not unheard of for head teacher Nigel Attwood to switch off his computer at the end of the school day and then to jump in his car to go to the supermarket, and to take supplies to a family in crisis, to make sure their children are fed through the weekend.

The school has also had to step in to pay gas and electricity bills for struggling families, while teachers have been approached by shame-faced parents needing help to provide Christmas dinner. At a parents' evening, two mothers tell me confidentially that during difficult family times, the Rainbow Room has often saved their sanity. Both independently describe the primary school's pastoral care service as a ""lifeline"".

Lorraine tells me that when she first started work at the school, 18 years ago, there was an educational social worker working beside her. But now, she and Jamie, neither of whom are trained psychologists, are completely on their own. When I ask her if she feels out of her depth sometimes, she shakes her head slowly and looks wearily at Jamie.

There's a very small pot of money within the pastoral budget to bring in specialised counsellors and educational psychologists.

""I don't think we are always the best placed people to be pushing for these children,"" Jamie admits. ""But the systems aren't there. Children's services are a sham at the moment. We get frustrated with them but we know the pressure they're under and why they struggle to do the things we think they should do.""

Another small, tear-stained face has appeared at the Rainbow Room's window and looks in hopefully. Jamie walks slowly towards the door.

""But somebody's got to keep pushing for these children,"" he says over his shoulder. ""Somebody's got to keep pushing.""

The four-and-a-half-day week

Emma Jane Kirby reported in June on Bellfield's decision to drop down to a four-and-a-half-day week.

It was feared that attendance might suffer as a result, but Nigel Attwood says attendance is now at its highest rate in 12 years.

Over the six months that I've been visiting Bellfield Junior School, there have been incidents that we cannot report for legal reasons. Last month, the receptionist who tots up attendance figures, alerted the pastoral team when she tried to contact the parents of a child with an unexplained absence from school. Alarmingly, the given telephone numbers proved to be unattributed or simply rang out.

""The families that resist our help we worry about,"" says Jamie. ""Because then other services have to move in on an emergency basis, and that's never good.""

Lorraine's eyes are unfocused when she talks about the children she suspects of being physically or sexually abused.

""We have sessions with them, we try to get them to talk,"" she says, ""but unless they actually tell us, there's really nothing we can do."" She's also concerned about parental drug and alcohol abuse, which she says always leaves children neglected.

We sit in silence for a moment. Jamie offers to switch on the soothing tweeting ""dicky-birds"" CD. The brightly coloured puppet slips from Lorraine's knee on to the floor.

Lorraine admits that she can't always sleep after a heavy day in the Rainbow Room. Often during the holidays, she says, she finds herself dialling Jamie's number for a chat. Jamie protests that he always slept peacefully when he worked as a police officer - there's no bravado in his voice when he says that policing was child's play next to his current job.

The thin little girl has reappeared at the door and squints at us anxiously through the glass. Lorraine gets up wearily.

But today it's celebration time and on stage now in the hall, Year 5 is belting out the Calypso carol while the shepherds and their flock sway self-consciously. Every child is word-perfect and completely focused on the performance. Those with speaking parts deliver their lines with evident pride and professionalism, ignoring interruptions from audience members' beeping mobile phones and younger siblings clamouring for juice or the toilet.

By the time they get to We Three Kings, any residual nerves have dissipated and each child is jubilant and sings joyfully. Their teachers watch them with genuine emotion and the applause is thunderous.

Nigel Attwood is grinning from ear to ear.

""We've done a lot of work with the children on resilience and aspirations,"" he shouts over the noise of scraping chairs as the hall is cleared. ""And it looks like it's really paid off.""

He pauses to congratulate an elated angel who is galloping back to class, still humming the Calypso carol under her breath.

""Some of our children have some really huge problems,"" Nigel reminds me. ""But tell me, did that show when they were up on that stage? The children gave it everything they've got.""

Since I began following Bellfield Juniors back in June, the school has had some glad tidings of its own. Although the BBC has not been fund-raising for the school and nor did Bellfield agree to take part in our programmes in the hope of receiving donations, nonetheless a number of concerned well-wishers have sent gifts of money, stationery, books and shoes, all of which have deeply touched head teacher Nigel Attwood and his deputy, Claire du Toit.

Last summer, Claire complained there were no whiteboard markers left in her classroom and that she couldn't order more until the new term and the new budget. The next day a jiffy bag of pens was pushed through the school's letter-box. Over the following weeks, several more packs arrived by post until Bellfield's supplies cupboard contained more than 700 pens. Cheques from £5 to £500 flooded in to help fix draughty windows, to fund school prizes and educational visits. And three huge consignments of shoes, sandals, trainers and wellies were sent from a shoe shop in the Channel Islands.

""If you could see the look on the children's faces when they get a brand-new pair of shoes or wellies,"" laughs Nigel. ""The way they look after them and how they go skipping down the corridor!""

""It's such a total surprise to see how other people do things for you and it gives you faith in the world really,"" interjects Claire. ""Everybody's looking out for everybody and we're not on our own.""

There was a moment last month, though, when the school really felt it was sinking. After breakfast club one morning, the dinner ladies noticed that the floor in the dining hall was buckling. Nigel Attwood showed me the damage and laughed bitterly when I asked him how he was going to manage the cost of replacing the floor. He retired to his office to punch numbers into a calculator but it was clear that, however good he may be at juggling figures, the repair work would push the school into deficit.

And then, incredibly, two BBC listeners stepped in and sent a cheque for £20,000 - enough to cover replacing the dining hall floor. Nigel Attwood and Claire du Toit still have difficulty expressing how they felt when they opened the envelope.

""I thought they'd got the noughts in the wrong place,"" smiles Nigel. ""Honestly, I was speechless. I have no words.""

Although he has never shared the school's financial difficulties with the pupils, he did decide to tell the children on the School Council (who are like prefects) about the donations. Flabbergasted, they asked first why someone wanted to help their little school so much and then immediately afterwards, asked if they might write the donors a letter of thanks?

""Apart from the overwhelming generosity, it's the fact that people are getting a really clear message about what's happening in school,"" reflects Claire. ""It's the understanding, really, that we did this for. Because it gets hidden under all sorts of other headlines… and there are so many schools in this position.""

She taps her pen on the desk to emphasise her point.

""It's the education of the children that suffers. And each year that goes by, each year it gets worse for them.""

Outside the staff room, Jamie Neadle is trying to cajole a little boy who's squeezed himself into a corner and who's hiding his face in his hood, back to his classroom. Recently a concerned psychologist who heard Jamie speak of Bellfield's difficulties on the radio, telephoned the school to offer staff some free training.

The £114,000 a year that Bellfield spends on pastoral care could pay for three more teachers, for more classroom assistants, for necessary school repairs. When budgets are stretched so tightly, difficult choices have to be made and Lorraine Harvey and Jamie Neadle say that since they are not part of the core teaching service, they always fear the axe might fall on their department.

""We can understand that, but what happens to the children then?"" asks Lorraine rhetorically.

Astoundingly, on the day I visit in October, she has spent much of her morning counselling a scared 10-year-old who's been approached by the local gun and knife gangs.

""Oh yes,"" she nods when I look at her incredulously. ""Gangs. It's constant. And it's mainly gun-gangs round here and some of our children are allowed to wander Northfield alone, so, you know, it's easy for the gangs to pick on them. The children just don't see the danger.""

Jamie agrees.

""We're seeing more and more of it,"" he says. ""We have children interacting with gangs on a daily basis because their parents don't know where they are. You have to remember a lot of our children don't have much, they don't have nice things, so if someone offers them something…""

He presses his fists to his temples.

""We haven't lost a child to a gang yet, but it's yet.""

Lorraine and Jamie begin to tidy the Rainbow Room, turning off lights and plumping the cushions.

""You know,"" says Jamie suddenly, with barely suppressed anger, ""we sit in here sometimes with our heads in our hands, because it's just heart-breaking.""

We can hear the busy chatter of children in the corridor putting on their home-time coats and wellies. Jamie jerks his thumb towards the noise.

""We have children in this school who could fly through university, who are as clever as any children in this country, in this world, but they will never get there because of the blockages in the way. They'll never get the opportunity because regardless of all the things we try to do, breaking the cycle that exists in society is impossible. It's heartbreaking.""

"On Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union,” 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questioned if President Donald Trump’s reasons for the Qasem Soleimani assassination was to distract from impeachment.

Warren said, “I think that the question that we ought to focus on is why now? Why not a month ago, and why not a month from now? And the answer from the administration seems to be that they can’t keep their story straight on this. They pointed in all different directions. And you know, the last time that we watched them do this was the summer over Ukraine. As soon as people started asking about the conversations between Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine and why aid had been held up to Ukraine, the administration did the same thing. They pointed in all directions of what was going on. And of course, what emerged then is that this is Donald Trump just trying to advance Donald Trump’s own political agenda. Not the agenda of the United States of America. So what happens right now? Next week, the president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he is deeply upset about that. I think that people are reasonably asking why this moment? Why does he pick now to take this highly inflammatory, highly dangerous action that moves us closer to war? We have been at war for 20 years in the Middle East, and we need to stop the war this the Middle East and not expand it.”

Tapper asked, “Are you suggesting that President Trump pulled the trigger and had Qasem Soleimani killed as a distraction from impeachment?”

Warren said, “Look, I think that people are reasonably asking about the timing and why it is that the administration seems to have all kinds of different answers. In the first 48 hours after this attack, what did we hear? Well, we heard it was for an imminent attack, and then we heard, no, no, it is to prevent any future attack, and then we heard that it is from the vice president himself and no, it is related to 9/11, and then we heard from president reports of people in the intelligence community saying that the whole, that the threat was overblown. You know, when the administration doesn’t seem to have a coherent answer for taking a step like this. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, a step that puts everyone at risk, and step that puts the military at risk and puts the diplomats in the region at risk. And we have already paid a huge price for this war. Thousands of American lives lost, and a cost that we have paid domestically and around the world. At the same time, look at what it has done in the Middle East, millions of people who have been killed, who have been injured, who have been displaced. So this is not a moment when the president should be escalating tensions and moving us to war. The job of the president is to keep us safe, and that means move back from the edge.”

Tapper pressed, “Do you believe that President Trump pulled the trigger on this operation as a way to distract from impeachment? Is that what you think?”

Warren said, “I think it is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration immediately after having taken this decision offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what is going on.”

She continued, “I think it is the right question to ask. We will get more information as we go forward but look at the timing on this. Look at what Donald Trump has said afterward and his administration. They have pointed in multiple directions. There is a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago and not a month from now, not a less aggressive and less dangerous response. He had a whole range of responses that were presented to him. He didn’t pick one of the other ones. He picked the most aggressive and the one that moves us closer to war. So what does everybody talk about today? Are we going to war? Are we going to have another five years, tens, ten years of war in the Middle East, and dragged in once again. Are we bringing another generation of young people into war? That is every bit of the conversation right now. Donald Trump has taken an extraordinarily reckless step, and we have seen it before, he is using foreign policy and uses whatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump.”

"Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais skewered Hollywood during his opening monologue of the annual award show on Sunday, cracking jokes about virtue signaling celebrities, Apple sweatshops, and (their “friend”) Jeffrey Epstein.

“You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg,” Gervais told the A-list crowd at the top of the show.

“So, if you win, come up, accept your little award tonight, come up, accept it, thank your agent and your God, and fuck off. No one cares about your views on politics or culture.”

Gervais saved his most stinging barb for Apple, which entered the entertainment business last year with the debut of Apple TV+. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in attendance during Sunday’s ceremony.

Gervais started by complimenting Apple’s The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, but soon switched into attack mode.

“A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company the at runs sweatshops in China,” the actor-comedian said.

“If ISIS started a streaming service, you all would be calling your agents.”

Ricky Gervais also made a joke about Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged close ties to Hollywood power brokers. The joke started with a reference to Gervais’ Netflix series After Life, in which he plays a depressed man who avoids committing suicide..

“So in the end he obviously didn’t kill himself. Just like Jeffrey Epstein. Shut up, I know he’s your friend but I don’t care,” Gervais said.

“In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, people from every background,” said Gervais. “But they all have one thing in common: they’re all terrified of Ronan Farrow. He’s coming for you. He’s coming for you.”

“Look, talking to all you perverts,” he added, “it was a big year for pedophile movies. ‘Surviving R. Kelly.’ ‘Leaving Neverland.’ ‘The Two Popes.'”

During his opening presentation, Gervais also dragged members of Hollywood for being a “friend” of the deceased convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who the host added, “obviously didn’t kill himself.”

“Shut up, I know he’s your friend, but I don’t care,” interjected Gervais after the audience seemed to react with gasps and murmurs. “You have to make your own way here, your own plane, didn’t you?”

"Comedian Ricky Gervais called out multinational corporation Apple for operating “sweatshops in China” while lecturing the American public about “the importance of dignity” during the 77th Golden Globes.

As part of his opening monologue for the awards show on Sunday evening, Gervais slammed Apple — whose CEO Tim Cook was sitting in the audience — for making their iPhones, iPads, and Macintosh products in “sweatshops in China.”

Ricky Gervais: ""…You say you're woke but the companies you work for…Apple, Amazon, Disney…if ISIS started a streaming service you'd call your agent, wouldn't you.

“Apple roared into the TV game with The Morning Show, a superb show,” Gervais said. “A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing, made by a company that runs sweatshops in China.”

“You say you’re ‘Woke,’ but the companies you work for Apple, Amazon, Disney if ISIS started a streaming service you’d call your agent, wouldn’t you,” Gervais said. “If you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech right.

“Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg,” Gervais continued. “So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent, and your God and f*ck off.”

Indeed, it has been well-documented how Apple makes about half of all the world’s iPhones at its factory in Zhengzhou, China. Since 2007, Apple has been accused of awful working conditions and labor abuses for its workforce.

Likewise, Amazon has been accused of selling products made in foreign factories that have so widely been accused of labor abuses that they have been blacklisted by other corporations. Disney, similarly, has been accused of laying off American workers and forcing them to train their foreign replacements in the United States.

“I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just the series of events that happen to you but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over, sometimes messy and scrawling, sometimes careful and precise, but one that I have carved with my own hand and I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose,” Williams continued.

"Actress Patricia Arquette attacked President Donald Trump during her rambling Golden Globes acceptance speech on Sunday, lambasting the president for his recent tweets in which he spelled out his hardline approach toward Iran.

Arquette, who won a Golden Globe for her supporting role in Hulu’s The Act, sported dark sunglasses and open cleavage while delivering a semi-coherent acceptance speech in which she invoked Iran, Australia, climate change, and the 2020 presidential election.

“We’re not going to look back on this night in the history books, we will see a country on the brink of war, the United States of America, the president tweeting out a threat of 52 bombs, including cultural sites. Young people risking their lives traveling across the world. People not knowing if bombs are gonna drop on their kids’ heads. And the continent of Australia on fire,” the actress said.

“So while I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world. For our kids and their kids, we have to vote in 2020 and we have to vote, and plead, for everyone we know to vote in 2020.”

The A-list Hollywood crowd assembled at The Beverly Hilton hotel loudly applauded Arquette’s speech.

Arquette has been a staunch anti-Trump activist, using her Twitter account to repeatedly insult the president. She recently called President Trump a “national security risk” and has advocated for passage of the Green New Deal.

Last year, Arquette praised FBI special counsel Robert Mueller while accepting a Screen Actors Guild award.

“Thank you, Robert Mueller and everyone working to make sure we have sovereignty for the United States of America!” she said a last year’s ceremony.

"Actor Joaquin Phoenix called out Hollywood’s faux environmentalists for flying “private jets from Palm Springs,” California, to award shows during the 77th Golden Globes on Sunday evening.

While accepting his award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama, Phoenix took a veiled shot at fellow actors like Leonardo DiCaprio who claim to be leading the fight against climate change while jet-setting around the world on private planes.

“It’s really nice that so many people have come up and sent their well wishes to Australia,” Phoenix said. “But we have to do more than that. It’s such a beautiful gesture. I’ve not always been a virtuous man … I hope together we can be unified and make some changes.”

“It’s great to vote, but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves and make changes and sacrifices in our own lives and I hope that we can do that,” Phoenix continued. “We don’t have to take private jets from Palm Springs to the awards, please. I’ll try to do better and I hope you will too.”

DiCaprio, among others, has flown across the Atlantic ocean on his private jet to accept an award honoring his commitment to environmentalism, as Breitbart News reported in 2016.

Phoenix also thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press for providing a fully vegan and plant-based menu for the Golden Globes this year — an important step in reducing carbon, the Joker actor said.

“First I’d like to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press for recognizing and acknowledging the link between animal, agriculture, and climate change,” Phoenix said. “It’s a very bold move, making tonight plant-based. And it really sends a powerful message.”

“Make no mistake. The tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based. We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy, and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way we all have a future,” Crowe said in the message, which was read by presenter Jennifer Aniston.

Aniston said that Russell Crowe couldn’t attend Sunday’s ceremony because he was in Australia “protecting his family from the devastating bush fires.”

This year’s Golden Globes ceremony has a climate-change theme. The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. said it would be serving entirely plant-based meals to attendees in an effort to draw attention to climate change.

The HFPA also said it will reuse this year’s red carpet at other events in order to reduce plastic waste, and will serve water in glass bottles.

“The climate crisis is surrounding us and we were thinking about the new year and the new decade. So we started talking between us about what we can do to send a signal,” HFPA president Lorenzo Soria told The Hollywood Reporter.

“We don’t think we’ll change the world with one meal, but we decided to take small steps to bring awareness. The food we eat, the way it is processed and grown and disposed of, all of that contributes to the climate crisis.”

"Actor George Lopez appeared to accept an Iranian bounty to assassinate President Donald Trump on Sunday evening. Iranian authorities had recently put an $80 million dollar bounty on the president’s head, but according to Lopez, he’ll do it for $40 million instead.

“[Iranian] authorities have put a bounty on American President Donald Trump’s head during the televised funeral of General [Qasem Soleimani] after he was assassinated last week,” said Chicano Worldstar to Instagram. “What are your thoughts?”

“We’ll do it for half,” replied Lopez from his official Instagram account.

When the George Lopez is not threatening to assassinate the president, he is apparently getting into altercations with Trump supporters, instead. Such was the case in November of 2018, when police charged Lopez with misdemeanor battery over an altercation involving “MAGA jokes” and “pro-Trump comments” at a Hooters restaurant, which was caught on tape.

In June of last year, the actor demanded that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deport Trump’s children, falsely suggesting that as the offspring of legal immigrants they qualified as “anchor babies.”

In 2017, The Smurfs actor called on President Trump to “deport police.”

“You wanna make the streets safer deport the police,” said Lopez.

While gallivanting around Los Angeles with friends a few summers ago, the Balls of Fury actor pretended to “pee” on President Trump’s Hollywood Star by placing a water bottle near his crotch and pouring the contents onto the plaque while grimacing.

"President Donald Trump said that the United States would not leave Iraq until the country paid the United States for the military base built there.

“We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time,” he said. “We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.”

Trump commented on Iraq and Iran as he traveled back to Washington, DC, from Mar-a-Lago after both countries protested his decision to eliminate Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Bagdhad in a drone strike on Friday.

In response to the strike, the Iraqi parliament on Sunday passed a resolution calling on the government to expel American troops from Iraq.

The president repeated that invading Iraq was “the worst decision ever made in the history of our country” and that he would continue to withdraw troops from the country.

“Iraq, by the way, they didn’t knock down the World Trade Center,” he said. “That’s been very nicely proven.”

But Trump said that the United States had spent billions of dollars in Iraq, and he threatened sanctions on the country if they tried to force out the United States.

“If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever,” he said. “It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.”

"During a Sunday appearance on MSNBC’s “Kasie DC,” network foreign affairs analyst Brett McGurk, the former U.S. special envoy for the coalition against the Islamic State, weighed in on the U.S. military’s recent airstrikes in Baghdad to kill Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani.

McGurk called the action a “big piece of business” that he said “means war” with Iran.

“When this happened about 96 hours ago or so, my immediate reaction was: number one, as someone who served in Iraq, there is an immediate sense of justice for the removal of Qasem Soleimani,” McGurk stated. “But number two, we need to presume that we are now at war with Iran. I don’t say that lightly. We can hope for the best, but the presumption is we’re at war with Iran.”

He continued, “[W]hat has happened since then with the statements, the tweets, the reporting, the shifting narratives from the administration, just shows a decision that clearly was not gamed out, was not well thought through. And for the President of the United States to say that we are prepared to strike 52 sites inside Iran with to congressional authorization, including cultural sites, which is clearly a violation of international law, stretches the boundaries of our constitutional republic to a real extreme. It’s almost unprecedented.”

"Forty-two states in the nation, and Washington, DC, continue to see their birth rates decline with no plans among lawmakers to financially incentivize Americans to have more children.

The latest United States Census Bureau data reveals that births in forty-two states, as well as Washington, DC, have kept dropping between 2018 and 2019. Only eight states — Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Washington, Utah, and Vermont — saw their birth rates increase between 2018 and 2019.

“With fewer births in recent years and the number of deaths increasing, natural increase (or births minus deaths) has declined steadily over the past decade,” the Census Bureau notes in its findings.

As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. birth rate, overall, has dropped for the fourth consecutive year. In 2018, less than 3.8 million babies were born in the U.S. — a drop of two percent, or almost 64,000 births, since 2017.

The total fertility rate, which stands at 1,729.5 births per 1,000 women, remains below replacement level — the number of births needed to at least replace a generation of Americans. Every year, there must be at least 2,100 births per 1,000 women to be considered at or above replacement level.

Since 1971, the birth rate has been below replacement level, according to the CDC. Birth rates across all major racial groups — non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic Asians — were again below replacement level for 2018.

Despite a declining birth rate below replacement level, Republican and Democrat lawmakers have yet to lay out a national agenda to increase American births, fertility, and family rates.

Oppositely, Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has implemented a pro-family agenda to increase his nation’s birth rate among similar rapid decline, as Breitbart News has reported. As part of that agenda, the government of Hungary gives a loan of $33,000 to eligible Hungarian couples after they marry. That loan is fully forgiven by the government so long as the couple has three children.

"Close to 400,000 anchor babies were born in the United States in 2019 as an executive order to end birthright citizenship gets kicked down the road for another year by President Donald Trump’s administration.

Analysis conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies revealed in 2018 that about 300,000 U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are born every year. These children, often referred to as “anchor babies,” immediately obtain American citizenship and anchor their illegal or foreign parents in the country.

In addition, about 72,000 anchor babies are born to foreign tourists, foreign visa workers, and foreign students every year — all of whom obtain immediate American citizenship simply for being born within the parameters of the country.

Altogether, about 372,000 anchor babies are estimated to have been born last year despite a commitment by Trump to sign an executive order ending the nation’s “anchor baby policy” that incentivizes pregnant migrant women to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in the hopes of securing American citizenship for their children.

This indicates that there were more anchor babies born in 2019 than births in each of the 50 states except California and Texas. California residents deliver about 455,000 babies a year, while Texans deliver about 379,000 babies a year, just slightly more than the total annual number of anchor babies born.

For example, there were more than 34 times as many anchor babies born nationwide than American children born in the state of Delaware and nearly five times as many anchor babies born nationwide than the American children born in Arizona.

To date, the U.S. Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled that the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic American citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.

Many leading conservative scholars argue the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th Amendment was ratified.

For more than a year, Trump has signaled that he has reviewed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, otherwise known as the “anchor baby policy.”

Today, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the U.S. under 18-years-old, exceeding the annual roughly four million American babies born every year and costing American taxpayers about $2.4 billion every year to subsidize hospital costs.

"Sunday on MSNBC’s “Kasie DC,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) commented on the U.S. military’s airstrikes in Baghdad which killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani.

Coons said he is “hoping” the President Donald Trump administration has “clear justification” for ordering the strikes, but he voiced his lack of confidence that it does because it “has had an uneven relationship with the truth.”

“I’m hoping that the administration has a clear justification for this step, but I’m not confident they do,” Coons told host Kasie Hunt. “The Trump administration has had an uneven relationship with the truth when it comes to the testimony we have heard over the last few weeks before the House Intelligence Committee and in front of Congress about the remarkable steps taken by the administration to dangle badly needed military aid in front of a vulnerable partner, Ukraine, that has faced aggression from Russia.”

He added, “It’s concerning that the Trump administration may have allowed political concerns to influence this decision. That’s something we’ll have to weigh in the classified briefing in the week ahead. Frankly, more than anything, Kasie, the Trump administration owes the American people a clear strategy and a justification for why they would escalate our tensions with Iran.”

"An illegal alien has been arrested by law enforcement officials nearly a decade after he allegedly raped a six-year-old girl.

Illegal alien Juan Carlos Hernandez, according to police, allegedly raped a six-year-old girl in March 2011 in Delaware where he had been living. Law enforcement officials were not aware of the alleged rape until October 2018 when the victim told a school therapist about the assault.

Nearly a decade after the alleged rape of the child, Hernandez was tracked down by police in Beaufort County, South Carolina, where he had fled. He was arrested by officers with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Now, the illegal alien is facing extradition to Delaware to face charges for second-degree rape of a minor. If convicted, Hernandez faces at least ten years and up to 25 years in prison.

"The New York Times reported Saturday that Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) risks alienating both Republicans and Democrats with his decision to only back one article of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

Rep. Golden became the only Democrat to split his decision on whether to impeach President Trump by deciding to vote for one article of impeachment charging that Trump abused the office of the presidency while voting against the other article of impeachment charging the president with obstructing Congress.

By voting for only one article of impeachment, the New York Times contended that the Maine Democrat will appeal to Maine’s independent voting bloc, even though it may alienate Republicans and Democrats who seek lawmakers who toe the party line.

“It might be a lonely place for me to be in Washington,” Rep. Golden told the Times. “But it’s not a lonely place for me to be here in Maine, and in my district.”

Rep. Golden ousted incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME) during the 2018 midterm elections by less than one percent, making Maine’s second congressional districts one of the many potential congressional districts Republicans could retake during the 2020 congressional elections.

However, in a more polarized country, many Maine politicians contend that Golden’s strategy to appeal to Maine’s independent voters may alienate both the larger voting populace.

Former Maine Republican senator William Cohen, who was one of the first Republicans to support impeachment of then-President Richard Nixon, said, “The split is much deeper than ever before, and the people who cross the lines are penalized.”

Kiernan Majerus-Collins — the chairman of the Lewiston, Maine, Democrats — said, “I have not seen a single conservative or Republican voter who said, ‘I really appreciate that you only voted to impeach Trump on one count rather than two.’”

Despite his claim to remain somewhat politically independent, Golden admitted, “I vote with the Democratic Party like 88 percent of the time. That’s, I think, a perfect way to step back and compare it to past Congresses and see how truly divided and partisan Congress has become — that I’m now one of the standout members.”

“People were automatically going to this cynical place of, ‘This young freshman thinks he can get away with pleasing both sides,’” Golden added. “He doesn’t understand he’s about to get run over by a Mack truck that’s coming right down the middle of the road.”","NYT: Jared Golden Risks Alienating Democrats, GOP on Impeachment",http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/01/05/new-york-times-jared-golden-risks-alienating-democrats-republicans-impeachment/,2020-01-05T00:00:00
"New York’s “bail reform” is giving “get out of jail free” cards to alleged hate crime perpetrators, allowing them to attack others.

Case in point: the release, without bail, of Tiffany Harris — twice in three days — after Harris’s initial arrest for an alleged unprovoked attack on a group of Jewish women in December. Her case exemplifies the flaws with New York’s Bail Elimination Act (NY Criminal Procedure Law § 510.10 et seq.), which went into effect on January 1st.

Harris first made the news after she allegedly attacked three young Orthodox women in Crown Heights, Brooklyn on Friday morning, December 27. Harris reportedly confessed to the police officers who arrested her: “Yes, I slapped them. I cursed them out. I said ‘F-U, Jews.’”

The day after her arrest, the Brooklyn Criminal Court released Harris without bail, reportedly under pressure to comply with the forthcoming New York Bail Elimination Act.

One day later — on Sunday, December 29 — Harris was again arrested – this time for allegedly attacking a woman who was walking with her 3-year-old son and baby daughter in Brooklyn. The victim was reportedly Jewish. Yet once again, the court released Harris the next day, without bail.

And once again, within a day Harris allegedly assaulted a social worker during a court-mandated meeting – Harris’ third alleged crime in just five days. She was finally kept in custody for psychiatric evaluation.

Notably, Harris’ alleged attacks occurred during a gruesome week in which Jews were attacked repeatedly in New York: between December 24 and January 1, there were 13 assaults on innocent Jews.

We cannot hope to stamp out the current plague of antisemitic attacks when attackers are immediately released back to the streets.

The flawed New York bail system was a risk to public safety even prior to the new Bail Elimination Act. The Vera Institute of Justice (a liberal group dedicated to eliminating cash bail) explained (emphasis added):

New York was, and remains, the only state in the country that precludes judges from taking into account any consider- ation of public safety when setting bail or imposing pretrial detention. Until the 1970s, all bail statutes only considered failure to appear. With the advent of “tough on crime” rhetoric and policies, several states began to amend their bail laws to in- clude a consideration of risk to public safety. In 1984, Congress passed the Federal Bail Reform Act, which introduced public safety in the federal bail system and survived a constitutional challenge in United States v. Salerno.7 Since then, 49 states, all except New York, have changed their bail laws to allow judges to consider both risk of failure to appear and public safety in pretrial decisions.

New York’s Bail Elimination Act exacerbated the prior risks in New York. The Vera institute calls New York’s new provisions “transformative” because it reduces the traditional discretion of the courts.

These “transformative” new provisions include:

(1) Mandating that the police must simply issue an appearance ticket (a summons) to most people charged with misdemeanors and Class E felonies, some of which are violent felonies.

(2) Mandating release for a wide swath of offenses, and requiring judges to jump through hoops to impose restrictions on defendants. New CPL [Criminal Procedure Law] § 500.10.1 provides that (emphasis added): “In all such cases [where a future court appearance may be required], except where another type of securing order is shown to be required by law, the court shall release the principal [arrested person] pending trial on the principal’s own recognizance, unless it is demonstrated and the court makes an individualized determination that the principal poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution. If such a finding is made, the court must select the least restrictive alternative and condition or conditions that will reasonably assure the principal’s return to court. The court shall explain its choice of release, release with conditions, bail or remand on the record or in writing.”

New York’s mandated release is unusually lenient. Every other state’s bail reform law merely require courts to consider a “presumption” of release for most offenses.

(3) As noted above when a condition on release is imposed, the judge is required to impose the “least restrictive” conditions on release that will “reasonably assure” the arrested person’s return to court. Further, the use of electronic monitoring is extremely limited. (See CPL § 500.10.3-a)

Imposing the “least restrictive” conditions that “reasonably assure” a return to court is far less protective of the public than the previous standard. New York law previously provided that “the court must consider the kind and degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure his [the defendant’s] court attendance.” (Prior CPL § 510.30.2(a).)

In all likelihood, fewer defendants will show up at their court hearings under the new standard, which does not impose conditions “necessary” to secure court attendance.

(4) Requiring judges to consider a person’s “ability to post bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his or her ability to obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond.” (CPL § 510.30.) When bail is imposed, judges are also required to set at least three or more forms of bail, one of which must be an unsecured or partially secured bond. An “unsecured bond” only requires payment if and when someone fails to show up for court, and offers far less incentive to return to court than paying bail prior to the court date does.

The previous version of CPL § 510.30 already required courts to consider a defendant’s “employment and financial resources.” The law thus already addressed the “bail system favors the rich” argument.

The new “ability to pay without undue hardship” requirement invites manipulation of the system.

(5) When a defendant fails to appear for his court date, the new law now requires judges to give defendants a 48-hour grace period to voluntarily appear prior to issuing a bench warrant. (CPL § 510.50) This potentially leaves defendants who pose a risk to the public in the community even longer.

What are the solutions?

First, New York needs to reconsider its refusal to consider danger to the public when making bail determinations.

Properly crafted laws can take danger to the community into account in bail and bail denial determinations. In United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld taking into account in bail determinations the arrestee’s dangerousness, for specific serious offenses where Congress found that arrestees were likely to repeat the offense if released, where the arrestees were provided with due process protections, including probable cause, and a full-blown adversary hearing.

Second, at a minimum, New York should amend its Bail Elimination Act so that the courts are not required to give mandatory desk tickets and mandatory release to the perpetrators of hate crimes. New York’s new “capture and release” system fails to take the plague of antisemitic hate crimes seriously.

Third, we need to return to a system that sets bail at an amount “necessary to secure” defendants’ return to court. The victims and potential future victims of antisemitic hate crimes deserve no less.

If the New York State legislature is sincere about stopping the antisemitic crime wave plague on New York’s streets, the legislature must immediately fix this new flawed system.

"Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) warned of a development that could clear the way for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to add a third article of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

McCarthy told host Jeanine Pirro of a ruling by the D.C. U.S. District Court of Appeals that would allow for the effort by congressional Democratic.

Partial transcript as follows:

Congressman, thanks for staying with us. Now, I want to talk about — and I’d love to stay with Iran, but I don’t have that much time.

I want to talk to you about impeachment. So Pelosi impeaches the President, so to speak. I’m not quite sure if she did or didn’t because it’s still in the House, and it hasn’t been transferred to the Senate.

So they were in a rush these Democrats. We’re going to get it done by the end of the year. We’re going to get it done by Christmas. They get it done by Christmas, and they’re slow to give it over to the Senate. What is going on? Do you know?

MCCARTHY: Well, I think Nancy Pelosi thinks she has more power than she does. Once she names the managers, it will go to the Senate.

But an interesting thing happened just yesterday in the U.S. District Court of Appeals inside D.C. Pelosi’s House Attorney, Douglas Letter made the argument before a judge that they could offer another Article of Impeachment.

This is the only thing the Democrats’ agenda is to try to impeach this President. Al Green has said it. You’ve heard it from so many other Democrats. It is their only goal of what they’re continuing to try to do. Their case is so weak.

I think part of the Speaker’s problem is she doesn’t want to show it over to the Senate, because bipartisan they’ll vote against it.

(CROSSTALK)

PIRRO: Wait, wait, OK — you’ve got to stop there. She wants to add another Article to the two Articles of Impeachment that we don’t even know if our Articles of Impeachment because they’re just in limbo right now, without a vote? She wants to add another, that’s like me —

MCCARTHY: That is an argument. That is what hurt —

PIRRO: Go ahead.

MCCARTHY: — her attorney made that argument in a Court of Appeals in D.C. yesterday before a judge when the judge questioned why are they even asking for this? It dealt with the Mueller Report because impeachment is over.

And he says, could there be another impeachment? He said, yes. Nancy Pelosi has signed off on that. We could go to a third Article of Impeachment. They have nothing else on their agenda.

While this President is taking terrorists out and making America safer. They’re trying to take the President out. They will not put America first by far.

(CROSSTALK)

PIRRO: This is outrageous. This is outrageous. OK, all right. Let’s follow this through, OK? Because this is infuriating. And it’s the first I’ve heard of it. I don’t think anybody said this so far.

So here you’ve got this woman in a rush to get impeachment. They get it done by the end of the year. Now the thing is in limbo. She goes to a court that’s like me indicting someone for petty larceny, and then saying, hey — after the grand jury voted — I’m going to indict him for murder, too, judge, let’s just throw that in there. What the heck? We don’t need an indictment (ph) — we don’t need to vote on it.

But the more important is the fact that right now, she says that she doesn’t want to send it over until she is sure it’s going to be fair in the Senate. I’ll tell you what I would do. I would tell Mitch McConnell that he ought to automatically dismiss it. There’s got to be a default. There’s got to be — if you’re entitled to a speedy trial, if you’re entitled to be able to — if there’s a statute of limitations, it’s passed.

This thing, there should be a default judgment, overdone for non- prosecution. What is McConnell waiting for?

MCCARTHY: Well, I think what McConnell is looking and seeing, and you’ve (ph) talked to all the senators over there. Here, they’re going back in session. We will be back in session next week. That is when Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, should name the managers and send it over.

She does not have a right to dictate what the Senate will do, just as the Senate didn’t have a right to dictate to the House.

In the House, she did not allow the minority to offer any witnesses. She did not give this President any procedures that we had given to Clinton and to Nixon. She changed the whole dynamic of where to go. And she forced us through the thinnest, the weakest and the fastest impeachment in the history.

She said it had to be bipartisan. And the only bipartisan vote was against impeachment.

She knows this is weak. She is showing her hand that it is weak, and when it goes into Senate, it will fail.

PIRRO: But this is crazy. Well, but why can’t the Senate dismiss it out of hand right now? If Article 1 Section 2 says the House impeaches, Article 1 Section 3 says that the Senate does the actual trial. You know what? I make a motion to dismiss. I make a motion to dismiss for non-prosecution, for failure to have a speedy trial, denial of my rights, all of that don’t even go along with this game. This is a charade. It’s a shell game.

I don’t mean to be upset with you. I am upset with Mitch McConnell.

MCCARTHY: It shows very clearly that it’s a shell game. If 51 senators —

PIRRO: Yes.

MCCARTHY: I hear you completely. And I think America is upset.

PIRRO: He is never coming on my show by the way now.

MCCARTHY: And you should be upset with Mitch McConnell. You should be upset — you should be very upset with Nancy Pelosi. Listen to what Schumer is asking. Schumer is now asking for witnesses when they would not even allow the minority to have witnesses.

They want to have Bolton. The Democrats could pull whoever they wanted. They never subpoenaed Bolton. But now they know their case is so weak. This is outrageous to the whole American public.

Here we are with so many other problems before us. We know this is going to fail in the Senate. If 51 senators got together based upon what Nancy Pelosi has done here, they could dismiss this. And I believe if —

PIRRO: Yes.

MCCARTHY: — Nancy Pelosi does not move with the managers in the next week, then I think you’ll see a movement within the Senate to do just that.

PIRRO: Well, I hope so. It should be done. It should have been done on January 1st. But what she is doing is she is holding her finger to the wind, hoping that something will increase the chances of impeachment to get a few extra senators in the Senate so that she can win.",McCarthy: Pelosi Could Go to a Third Article of Impeachment,http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/mccarthy-pelosi-third-article-impeachment/,2020-01-05T00:00:00
"Former Illinois state representative and sixth congressional district Republican candidate Jeanne Ives told Breitbart News Saturday that Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) is a “symbol” of the radical left’s agenda.

Ives hopes to unseat freshman Democrat Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) in the 2020 congressional elections. Casten represents one of the many seats that Democrats managed to flip during the 2018 midterm elections. Republicans hope to retake roughly 20 congressional seats to retake the House majority.

The Illinois Republican said that Casten, who voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, was more radical than many House Democrats in his pursuit to impeach the president.

She told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “Sean Casten has a 100 percent voting rate with Pelosi and her agenda, and he was for impeaching Donald Trump before Pelosi was for impeaching Donald Trump. And then prior to the Mueller report he wanted to impeach Trump, after the Mueller report he wanted to impeach Trump, then he wanted to impeach Brett Kavanaugh, then he was moving to impeach Trump prior to the transcript’s release and then afterward, he is a walking symbol of the left’s far agenda.”

“He [Casten] does not fit this district, and people are coming to figure that out, and we’re going to make sure that we get representation rather than a ruling class mentality in the 6th congressional [district],” Ives added.

Ives added that unlike Casten, a number of Democrats such as former Democrat Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN), and other Democrats opposed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) partisan articles of impeachment.

The Illinois Republican candidate then said that during her time in the state House of Representatives, she opposed Republicans and Democrats’ efforts to spend recklessly.

Ives said, “I will be honest, I have been someone who has taken on both parties in the state of Illinois Republican and Democrats when it comes to unfunded mandates, against unbalanced budgets, and tax increases, and Sean Casten could have easily made a good for taxpayers, and he failed he just went in with leadership.”

Ives added that the many Americans are rejecting the radical left’s policies, which will lead to a landslide 2020 election year.

“If these people aren’t trying to take away your red meat, they’re trying to take away your red hat, who wants that? Who wants more government control from the ruling class? People are rejecting that wholesale and so 2020 is going to be a banner year; I can’t wait,” she said.

Friday, the hospital tweeted a photo of a koala that was released back into the wild after suffering from smoke inhalation.

“Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors was established in 2002 by Steve and Terri Irwin as a way to include and involve other caring people in the protection of injured, threatened or endangered wildlife – from the individual animal to an entire species,” its website stated.

Friday, Terri tweeted that Ollie the platypus was “one of the lucky ones,” adding that “he’ll be well cared for until he can be released back to the wild.”

Sadly, the animal death toll from the fires has been estimated at nearly half a billion in one area alone. However, experts believe the burned forests will recover and that koalas, kangaroos, and other species affected by the wildfires will return in the future.

This week, actress Nicole Kidman and husband Keith Urban donated $500,000 to help those affected by the brushfires, according to Breitbart News.

“Our family’s support, thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the fires all over Australia. We are donating $500,000 to the Rural Fire Services who are all doing and giving so much right now,” Kidman wrote on Instagram.

Saturday, singer Pink also gave $500,000 to help combat the wildfires.

"A parrot caused quite a stir when a neighbor called police after hearing someone screaming for help in Palm Beach County, Florida, December 29.

When deputies with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office showed up at the home where the cries were reportedly heard, “Hilarity ensued,” according to its recent Facebook post.

Video footage showed the moment just before the officers came to the house to investigate. The homeowner was working in his driveway as his 40-year-old parrot, Rambo, squawked, “Let me out! Let me out! Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhh!” in the background.

“What’s going on, man,” one of the four officers asked the homeowner as they approached him. The man then proceeded to open his back gate and told the deputies, “I’ll bring out the screamer to you.”

A few moments later, he emerged with the talkative bird on his hand and showed him to his new friends.

“I promptly introduced the officers to Rambo and we all had a good laugh,” Rambo’s owner wrote beneath the video posted on YouTube.

“Afterward, I also introduced Rambo to the neighbor who called in the screaming. She too had a good laugh. Sometimes Rambo yells ‘help, help, let me out’. Something I taught him when I was a kid and Rambo lived in a cage.”

Bigger parrots can live as long as humans and some may even outlive their owners, according to the Spruce Pets website.

“As a general rule, the larger the bird, the longer the expected lifespan is.”

In the video, Rambo appeared to be a Yellow-Naped Amazon Parrot, judging by his vibrantly colored feathers.

“The Yellow-Naped Amazon Parrot is the talking favorite among the genus of Amazon Parrots. Many even become accomplished singers.

"On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” former Gov. Pat McCrory (R- NC) argued Democrats’ attacks against President Donald Trump after the killing Qasem Soleimani sounded like Iranian talking points.

McCrory said, “When the president killed a terrorist who was hiding behind the Iranian flag — but he was really a terrorist who was only 15 miles away from our embassy — he’s then called by Democratic leaders incompetent, unstable, act of war, terrorist. Just verbal attacks by our Democratic leaders. And that’s making him more weak because I think the Democrats at this point in time went too far in their rhetoric in making our country weaker in responding now to the Iranians’ possible counterattack.”

He added, “The Democrats have made these very personal attacks. In fact, they could almost be speaking points for the Iranian regime. We can’t make our president the villain in this.”

"On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” former Gov. Pat McCrory (R- NC) argued Democrats’ attacks against President Donald Trump after the killing Qasem Soleimani sounded like Iranian talking points.

McCrory said, “When the president killed a terrorist who was hiding behind the Iranian flag — but he was really a terrorist who was only 15 miles away from our embassy — he’s then called by Democratic leaders incompetent, unstable, act of war, terrorist. Just verbal attacks by our Democratic leaders. And that’s making him more weak because I think the Democrats at this point in time went too far in their rhetoric in making our country weaker in responding now to the Iranians’ possible counterattack.”

He added, “The Democrats have made these very personal attacks. In fact, they could almost be speaking points for the Iranian regime. We can’t make our president the villain in this.”

"Two polls released on Sunday show that support for Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is on the rise among Democrats likely to participate in the February 3 Iowa caucuses and the February 11 New Hampshire primary.

The CBS News Battleground Tracker poll of registered Democrats in Iowa shows Sanders in a three way tie for the lead with Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. All three have 23 percent support among likely caucus attendees. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is in fourth place with 16 percent support, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is in fifth place with 7 percent support.

Sanders has a significant lead among younger likely caucus attendees.

Among likely caucus attendees aged 18 to 44, Sanders is in first place with 38 percent support. Buttigieg and Warren are tied in a distant second with 18 percent support, while Joe Biden is in fourth place with 15 percent.

Among likely caucus attendees aged 45 and older, Biden is in the lead with 27 percent, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg with 25 percent. Warren has 18 percent, and Sanders has 15 percent.

Warren’s support is only at 11 percent among men who are likely to participate in the caucuses, while it is at 19 percent among women.

Notably, 41 percent of poll respondents say this will be the first time they participate in a caucus.

The poll of 953 registered Iowa Democrats was conducted between December 27 and January 3, and has a 3.8 percent margin of error.

The CBS News Battleground Tracker poll of registered Democrats in New Hampshire shows Sanders in the lead with 27 percent support from likely Democrat primary voters, followed by Joe Biden in second place with 25 percent. Warren is in third with 18 percent, followed by Buttigieg with 13 percent and Kobuchar with 7 percent.

Sanders enjoys the same popularity with younger voters in New Hampshire as he does with younger voters in Iowa.

Among likely caucus attendees aged 18 to 44, Sanders is in first place with 39 percent support. Warren trails with 21 percent support, followed by Biden with 14 percent and Buttigieg with 9 percent.

Among likely caucus attendees aged 45 and older, Biden is in the lead with 31 percent, followed by Sanders with 20 percent. Warren and Buttigieg trail with 15 percent each.

The gender disparity among Warren supporters is less pronounced in New Hampshire than it is in Iowa.

Among likely Democrat voters, 16 percent of men support Warren, while 19 percent of women support her.

"On Sunday’s broadcast of ABC’s “This Week,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration is cleaning up the “mess” the Obama administration created in Iran.

Partial transcript as follows:

STEPHANOPOULOS: There’s also the question going forward if you take any new action against Iran is congressional authorization needed. Former Vice-President Biden spoke about that yesterday. Let’s listen.

JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT: I’m going to make it clear, President Trump has no authority to take us to a military conflict with Iran, period. The bottom line is any further action against Iran requires congressional authorization.

(END VIDEOCLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Will the president go to Congress before taking new military action against Iran?

POMPEO: Boy, it’s really something to hear the vice-president from the previous administration be critical of this administration’s policy of Iran. We’re having to clean up their mess, George. We’ll do everything required under the law to bring us into compliance with all the relevant constitutional legal provisions with respect to our duties to the legislative branch.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that mean you’ll seek new authorizations or no?

"Actors and actresses in anti-gun Hollywood will be surrounded by armed security on Sunday as they attend the 77th annual Golden Globes.

New York Daily News reports Beverly Hill Police Department Capt. Michael Hill saying, “We have a robust security plan that includes assistance from our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners. Additionally, we will be using the most contemporary technologies in an attempt to ensure the ceremony is held without incident.”

Variety quotes Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Maycott noting that the US strike against Iran has not altered the security plan. Rather, he noted that “security is similar to what it was last year.”

Breitbart News reported that 2019 security included barricades, bomb-sniffing dogs, armed guards, LAPD officers, and numerous security checkpoints for attendees as they arrived for the Golden Globes.

Golden Globes security has been high level for many years. Breitbart News noted that the January 8, 2017, Golden Globes were surrounded by good guys with guns and body armor. There were also security dogs, SWAT, and special FBI teams taking part in security.

Breitbart noted that Matt Damon was at the 2017 awards, the very Matt Damon who made millions of dollars using guns in the Bourne film series, yet called for an Australia-like gun ban for the rest of America. Other gun controllers, including Jessica Chastain and Ryan Reynolds, were also in attendance, enjoying the benefits of good guys with guns while fighting off-screen to limit those benefits for average Americans.

The 2016 Golden Globes featured security personnel wearing tactical gear and carrying handguns and AR-15s with “high capacity” magazines, weapons that looked very similar to civilian guns so many Hollywood actors and actresses want to bar law-abiding citizens from owning.

Throughout 2019, Hollywood celebrities have reacted to criminal use of firearms by calling for more gun controls across the board. For example, following the July 28, Garlic Festival attack in Gilroy, California, actors John Leguizamo, Billy Baldwin, and Bradley Whitford all voiced gun control rhetoric.

Following a November 14, 2019, shooting at Saugus High School, in San Clarita, California, actress Debra Messing tweeted for gun control and made sure to include a shout-out to Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action.





Little Mermaid’s Lin-Manuel Miranda made a general call for more “gun control now,” while Piper Perabo used the shooting to push for universal background checks in particular.

None of the celebrities noted that California already has every gun control the Democrats are pushing at the federal level, including an “assault weapons” ban, a 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, firearm registration requirements, confiscation laws, and universal background checks. The celebrities also failed to mention that the Garlic Festival and Saugus High School were both gun-free zones.

"Far-left documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has begged the Iranian regime not to respond with violence to the drone strike that killed the country’s terror chief Major General Qasem Soleimani, promising that he and millions of Americans will get rid of President Donald Trump at the ballot box in November.

Soleimani and at least three other militiamen were killed by an American drone strike last week at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, responded by pledging “harsh vengeance” against the United States, raising fears about a potential war between the two countries.

In an “Emergency Podcast” to his listeners and the Iranian people, Moore said that although he does not favor theocratic regimes, he sympathizes with Iran because of the way they have been treated by the United States.

“I would like to ask you, as much as you have the right to and as much as you want to, I would like you, the leadership of the country of Iran, to not respond with violence to the United States,” Moore said.

The 65-year-old filmmaker went on to urge the Iranian leadership to not play into Trump’s hands with violent retaliation, but instead wait for Congress or the American electorate to remove Trump through impeachment or an election.

“I am asking you to try what Martin Luther King and Gandhi said requires the most amount of courage which is to respond with non-violence,” he continued. “I am asking you to leave this up to me, give me all of 10 months and I and millions of Americans will remove Trump from the White House.”

I have just sent the Ayatollah of Iran a personal appeal asking him not to respond to our assassination of his top General with violence of any kind, but rather let me & millions of Americans fix this peacefully. Apple:https://t.co/yQ7JTAHqw8 Spotify:https://t.co/a9vUxmWc50 — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 5, 2020

Moore says he recorded the podcast episode and sent it in a direct message via social media to Iran’s leader.

“I have just sent the Ayatollah of Iran a personal appeal asking him not to respond to our assassination of his top General with violence of any kind, but rather let me & millions of Americans fix this peacefully,” Moore wrote on Instagram.

“I recorded and DM’d him a message on my podcast, ‘RUMBLE.’ You can hear it on any podcast platform like Apple or Spotify for free. We need to prevent war, any war. Now. When the Ayatollah responds, I’ll post his reply.”

He later shared his message with his Twitter following, describing it as a “personal appeal” from him and the millions of Americans who do not seek conflict with Iran.

“I have just sent the Ayatollah of Iran a personal appeal asking him not to respond to our assassination of his top General with violence of any kind, but rather let me & millions of Americans fix this peacefully,” Moore wrote.

Moore, who is a rabid supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, appears to have developed newfound confidence that Trump will be voted out of office in November. Just last month, he predicted that Trump would win reelection for similar reasons that he famously foresaw his victory in 2016.

“The problem is, is that he will — if the vote were today, I believe, he would win the electoral states that he would need, because, living out there, I will tell you, his level of support has not gone down one inch,” he said during an interview on Democracy Now!.

"The Golden Globes are famously unpredictable, but a few sure things seem to be in store for Sunday’s awards: Streaming services will play a starring role; five-time host Ricky Gervais will snicker at his own jokes; and Brad Pitt is all but assured of taking home an award.

Plenty of question marks remain for the 77th Golden Globe Awards, though. Will Jennifer Lopez score her first Globe? Who will win best song in the faceoff between Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Elton John? Just how many “Cats” jokes are too many?

But whatever the cat drags in Sunday, the Golden Globes — Hollywood’s most freewheeling televised award show — should be entertaining.

They also might be unusually influential. The 87 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have traditionally had little in common with the nearly 9,000 industry professionals that make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The HFPA is known for calculatingly packing its show with as much star power as possible, occasionally rewarding even the likes of “The Tourist” and “Burlesque.”

But the condensed time frame of this year’s award season brings the Globes and the Academy Awards closer in proximity. Balloting for Oscar nominations began Thursday; voters will be watching.

The Golden Globes will begin at 8 p.m. EST and be broadcast live on NBC from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.

Netflix comes into the Globes with a commanding 34 nods — 17 in film categories and 17 in television categories. Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” leads all movies with six nods, including best film, drama. Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” with five nominations, is up for the same category. The box-office smash “Joker” may be their stiffest competition.

The path is more certain for Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” which is competing in the comedy or musical category. It could easily take home more trophies than any other movie, with possible wins for Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio — a 12-time Globes nominee and three-time winner — and Tarantino’s script. Tarantino is also up for best director, though he faces formidable competition in Scorsese and “Parasite” filmmaker Bong Joon Ho.

The dearth of nominations for female filmmakers has stoked more backlash than anything else at this year’s Globes. Only men were nominated for best director (just five women have ever been nominated in the category), and none of the 10 films up for best picture was directed by a woman, either.","From Ricky Gervais to Expected Winners, Here’s What to Expect at the Golden Globes",http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/01/05/ricky-gervais-to-j-lo-what-to-expect-at-the-golden-globes/,2020-01-05T00:00:00

"Actress Rose McGowan defended her tweet in which she apologized on behalf of the U.S. to Iran for “disrespecting their flag and people” after a U.S. military airstrike killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country’s top general.

“I don’t support Iran over America. I want America to be better,” McGowan The Associated Press. “I woke up, I stupidly looked at Twitter. I was going to the bathroom, and I was like, ‘what?'”

Rose McGowan apologized to Iran following the airstrike.

“Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us,” the Scream actress said in a late-night rant.

Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us. #Soleimani pic.twitter.com/YE54CqGCdr — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) January 3, 2020

“Thanks a lot, dickhead,” McGowan tweeted at President Trump before attempting to explain how “it is only logical to appeal to Iran’s pride by apologizing.”

“Of course #Soleimani was an evil evil man who did evil evil things. But that at this moment is not the fucking point. The United States is morally corrupt and acts illegally. It is only logical to appeal to Iran’s pride by apologizing. I’m taking one for the team. #TeamStayAlive,” the actress-activist said about a man who was personally responsible for the murder of thousands of innocents both in Iran and in neighboring countries, including hundreds of Americans.

Rose McGowan faced outrage over her Twitter rant, with some suggesting she move to Iran. McGowan acknowledged that her tweet was unusual.

“So, I just thought I would do something a little strange or unusual … bloodshed should be avoided if you can,” she said. “And I kind of just thought, what if I take a really bizarre way around this. A very strange thought, I understand.”

"Actress Rose McGowan defended her tweet in which she apologized on behalf of the U.S. to Iran for “disrespecting their flag and people” after a U.S. military airstrike killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country’s top general.

“I don’t support Iran over America. I want America to be better,” McGowan The Associated Press. “I woke up, I stupidly looked at Twitter. I was going to the bathroom, and I was like, ‘what?'”

Rose McGowan apologized to Iran following the airstrike.

“Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us,” the Scream actress said in a late-night rant.

Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us. #Soleimani pic.twitter.com/YE54CqGCdr — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) January 3, 2020

“Thanks a lot, dickhead,” McGowan tweeted at President Trump before attempting to explain how “it is only logical to appeal to Iran’s pride by apologizing.”

“Of course #Soleimani was an evil evil man who did evil evil things. But that at this moment is not the fucking point. The United States is morally corrupt and acts illegally. It is only logical to appeal to Iran’s pride by apologizing. I’m taking one for the team. #TeamStayAlive,” the actress-activist said about a man who was personally responsible for the murder of thousands of innocents both in Iran and in neighboring countries, including hundreds of Americans.

Rose McGowan faced outrage over her Twitter rant, with some suggesting she move to Iran. McGowan acknowledged that her tweet was unusual.

“So, I just thought I would do something a little strange or unusual … bloodshed should be avoided if you can,” she said. “And I kind of just thought, what if I take a really bizarre way around this. A very strange thought, I understand.”

"On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” anchor Chris Wallace asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if the airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani was a “big step back’ in President Donald Trump’s commitment to stop endless wars.

Wallace asked, “Is the president pulling us out of endless wars in the Middle East, or with his action this week, did he take a big step back in?”

Pompeo said, “Endless wars are the direct result of weakness, and President Trump will never let that happen. We are going to get our facilities as hardened as we can possibly get them to defend against what Iran may potentially do, but make no mistake, America’s mission is to have our footprint in the Middle East reduced while still keeping America safe. Safe from rogue regimes like the Islamic Republic of Iran and from terrorist activity broadly throughout the region.”

Wallace asked. “So is it fair to say that while the big strategy is to pull the U.S. out of endless wars, at least in the short term, there could be more of a commitment?”

Pompeo said, “The Obama Administration created an enormous risk to the American people in Iran. This administration is working to reduce that risk.”

"On Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said the intelligence he has seen as a member of the Gang of Eight, does not support the Trump administration’s claim the killing Qasem Soleimani decreased the risk to American lives.

Schiff said, “It was a reckless decision that increased the risk to America all around the world, not decreased it. When Secretary Pompeo says that this decision to take out Qasem Soleimani saved American lives, saved European lives, he is expressing a personal opinion, not an intelligence conclusion.”

He continued, “I think it will increase the risk to Americans around the world. I have not seen the intelligence that taking out Soleimani was going to either stop the plotting that is going on or decrease other risks to the United States.”

He added, “The question is, did the plotting here rise to the level that required his elimination from the battlefield? Would that elimination stop the plotting, or would it accelerate it? Or would it make the attacks in the United States greater or not worse? I don’t think the intelligence supports the conclusion that removing Soleimani increases our security.”

He concluded, “The question is, why now? Is this going to increase or decrease the risk of war? I think it is going to increase the risk of war with Iran.”

"On Sunday’s broadcast of ABC’s “This Week,” host George Stephanopoulos asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo why President Donald Trump was “threatening Iran with war crimes.”

Stephanopoulos was referencing the president’s tweet.

….targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!

Partial transcript as follows:

STEPHANOPOULOS: And on the face of this, we are seeing new threats from Iran, and a strong counter-threat overnight from President Trump. I want to show a tweet he put overnight.

He said: Let this serve as a warning that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites, representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago, some at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, will be hit very fast and very hard.

As you know, the Geneva Conventions outlaw attacks on cultural objects and places of worship. Our own DOD war manual discusses the protection of cultural property.

So, why is the president threatening Iran with war crimes?

POMPEO: Yes. We’ll behave lawfully. We’ll behave inside the system. We always have and we always will, George. You know that.

The president was getting to this point. In the past, previous administrations had allowed Shia militias to take shots at us, and in the past, we responded in theater, trying to challenge and attack everybody who was running around with AK-47 or a piece of indirect artillery.

We’ve made a very different approach. We’ve told the Iranian regime, enough. You can’t get away with using proxy forces and think your homeland will be safe and secure.

We’re going to respond against the actual decision-makers, the people who are causing this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran. We’re going to take this seriously and we’re going to defend the American people at every turn, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So, just to be clear, when the president said he had 52 Iranian sites, including sites important to the Iranian culture, that wasn’t accurate?

POMPEO: George, I’ve seen what we are planning in terms of the target set. I’m sure the Department of Defense is continuing to develop options. The American people should know that every target that we strike will be a lawful target, and it will be a target designed with a singular mission, of protecting and defending America.

President Trump has been diligent about that. He doesn’t want war. Talked about this repeatedly. He is a reluctant participant in this. But he will never shy away from protecting America.",ABC’s Stephanopoulos to Pompeo: ‘Why Is the President Threatening Iran with War Crimes?’,http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/01/05/abcs-stephanopoulos-to-pompeo-why-is-the-president-threatening-iran-with-war-crimes/,2020-01-05T00:00:00

"On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace called the Trump administration killing Qasem Soleimani “a dramatic escalation,” in tensions with Iran.

Wallace said, “Does the decision to escalate dramatically and I think we would agree it was a dramatic escalation to take out Qasem Soleimani, does it make the U.S. more safe or less safe? And if Iran decides to keep its promise to retaliate dramatically, does the Trump administration have a strategy?”

Former Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Michael Anton pushed back, saying, “I don’t know that I would necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. You could interpret it as a justified retaliation for all kinds of things that Iran has been doing without much of a response. The main point I would want to make here is the Iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation. And when they finally do get pushed back, the next ten to back down and go into turtle mode for a little while, and that may yet happen again. We’ve seen that happen in the past. They haven’t faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the Iran deal all around the Middle East, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they I think got overconfident. To some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that Soleimani went right into Iraq and the airport completely confident that he owns the place and that nothing would happen to him. So I think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to move you make regime treat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.”

Wallace then asked, “President Trump very publicly and has reaffirmed that as recently as this fall with the situation in Syria, ran on getting the U.S. out of endless wars in the Middle East but as I discussed with Secretary Pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 u.s. troops into the region, so are we getting out, or are we getting deeper?”

Former Chief of Staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Josh Holmes said, “I don’t think that’s inconsistent at all. I think it is an overarching policy and Secretary Pompeo articulate and very clearly is to remove America from these endless wars and his conflicts in Syria, conflicts in Iraq, and beyond. but that also cannot override immediate security threats.”

"Former NFL second-string quarterback and national anthem protester Colin Kaepernick’s anti-American tweets upon the death of Iranian terror General Qasem Soleimani have stirred a massive backlash on Twitter.

Soleimani, who was commander of Iran’s Quds Force, was eliminated in a U.S. strike on Thursday. Established after the Iranian revolution in the late 1970s, the Quds Force is Iran’s chief exporter of terrorism across the Middle East and the world and is responsible for the deaths of millions of people going back decades.

Also, taken out in the U.S. strike was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a prominent Iraqi militant aligned with Iran, also a major terrorist.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the military strike and said that the U.S. had intelligence that Soleimani was in the process of planning a broad attack on American and Iraqi forces. The strike, Pompeo said, was meant to disrupt those plans.

But to Colin Kapernick, the strike against Iran’s exporting of terrorism was a black mark against the United States instead of an attack against terror. Indeed, the former NFL player accused America of being the terrorists.

With a pair of tweets, Kaepernick attacked the U.S. as perpetrating terror against “black and brown bodies,” adding that U.S. troops are forces of “imperialism” that are responsible for plundering the “non-white world.”

There is nothing new about American terrorist attacks against Black and Brown people for the expansion of American imperialism. — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) January 4, 2020

America has always sanctioned and besieged Black and Brown bodies both at home and abroad. America militarism is the weapon wielded by American imperialism, to enforce its policing and plundering of the non white world. — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) January 4, 2020

But Kaepernick’s slander against our country and our soldiers did not go unanswered. The backlash to the former San Francisco 49er was swift.

People across Twitter slapped Kapernick down for his rampant anti-Americanism:

Is that its own racism of low expectations? pic.twitter.com/vNqdMBkmho — Asra Q. Nomani, PI (@AsraNomani) January 5, 2020

Can people now stop claiming that “all” Colin Kaepernick does is “protest against police brutality”?

"Florida veterinarians were able to give a dog’s owner a Christmas miracle by reviving a dog whose heart stopped following an animal attack on Christmas Eve.

The team of veterinarians at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine said that Neo, the one-year-old French bulldog, is among the rare 5 percent of animals whose hearts fail, yet will continue to live full, healthy lives.

However, Neo needed to have a leg amputated.

“Typically when an animal passes and comes back, they have to be on a mechanical ventilator, a breathing machine,” Bobbi Conner, a University of Florida professor and a veterinarian specializing in emergency medicine, told the Gainesville Sun.

Neo’s owner, Gerald Ford, let him out of the house to do his business on December 24, 2019, but he never came back. Later on, Ford said he heard a loud thud on his front porch in the middle of the night and found his canine companion was rapidly losing blood.

“I’ll never forget the look on his face,” Ford said. “It was like he was saying, ’Help me.’”

By Christmas Day, Neo’s breathing and blood pressure had stabilized enough that he could be returned to Ford wrapped in a blanket.

Ford said he was unsure which type of animal attacked his beloved pooch, but he is sure that his companion will go on with life as a three-legged dog.",Florida Veterinarians Revive Dog Whose Heart Stopped,http://www.breitbart.com/environment/2020/01/05/florida-veterinarians-revive-dog-whose-heart-stopped/,2020-01-05T00:00:00

"A Hackettstown, New Jersey, police officer and military veteran received a patriotic surprise dog house for his K9 companion on Friday.

Hackettstown police announced Friday that Patrolman Chris Laver, who served in the Iraq war and had a K9 partner named Jada on the police force, was the surprise recipient of the red, white, and blue painted dog house, Lehigh Valley Live reported.

Jada is a Belgian Malinois, a breed used by law enforcement and military personnel due to their “high drive, small size and astonishing work ethic,” according to Hackettstown police spokesman, Sgt. Darren Tynan.

“Jada is (from) the second litter bred here in the United States,” Tynan told Lehigh Valley Live in an email. “She was formally accepted in August 2016 as our first K9 officer. We went on to train for narcotics and patrol certifications for more than 10 months.”

Laver, Jada’s owner, served in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 with the U.S. Army 10th Mountain Division’s 57th Gun Truck Co, WRNJ reported.

“My passion for K9 started during my deployment as I worked with and observed military explosive detection dogs,” Laver said. “That’s when I learned about the Malinois breed. I had no formal K9 training until…I purchased Jada as a puppy. From that point on, I would work with K9 handlers and civilian K9 teams to learn and observe.”

“We then attended and graduated from the Union County Sheriff’s K9 Academy with the certification in narcotics and patrol, criminal apprehension, tracking, article searches, etc.,” Laver continued.

Lou DiBella, the creator of the dog house, said it took him about 45 hours to build, paint, and decorate the customized dog house in the colors of the American flag.

DiBella asked his friends on Facebook on December 16 to spread the word about his creation and his intent to donate it to a worthy cause.

Lavers’s friend surprised him with the news that he would be receiving DiBella’s custom-made dog house for Jada.

"The San Diego City Council is planning to spend $100 million over the next ten years to fix the city’s broken sidewalks.

“The proposal is part of an effort to prevent more lawsuits from continuing to pile up against the city,” Fox 5 reported.

“Sidewalks throughout San Diego are often damaged when tree roots push up through the concrete, posing tripping hazards to pedestrians that can be dangerous.”

Councilman Scott Sherman said the city has spent nearly $10 million in injury payouts, due to residents tripping and falling on the broken sidewalks.

“If we would have addressed these things back in the past, we wouldn’t be having those issues now,” he said.

In one lawsuit, the city was forced to pay Cynthia Hedgecock, wife of former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, nearly $85,000 when she suffered from ruptured breast implants after she fell on a sidewalk, according to KTLA.

However, because sidewalk repair is the legal responsibility of adjacent property owners, city officials initially considered using property liens and education campaigns to encourage homeowners to have them fixed.

Now, the city has decided it will take responsibility.

District 5 Councilman Mark Kersey is behind the plan to spend the $100 million to fix the city’s walkways.

“What I’d like to do is spend a lot less money on settling injury claims that people have filed…and spend more money on actually fixing the problem,” Kersey said.

His page on the city’s website stated:

Mark believes maintaining and improving the City’s roads, sidewalks, parks and fire stations is the most pressing issue facing San Diego. As Chair of the Council’s Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he is helping reform how the city evaluates, prioritizes, and invests in infrastructure. He has successfully advocated for increased infrastructure investment in the general fund and orchestrated the development of San Diego’s first comprehensive Multi-Year Infrastructure Investment Plan.

Mission Valley resident Anna Delial stated that she was disappointed it took the city so long to come up with a plan, adding that the sidewalks near her home give her senior dog fits because they are in such terrible shape.

“It’s a sign of years, decades of neglect,” she concluded.

"At least five people were killed and dozens more were injured in a multi-vehicle crash early Sunday on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The crash involved a tour bus, passenger vehicles, and two tractor-trailers, NBC News reported.

Pennsylvania Turnpike spokesperson Carl DeFebo confirmed in a tweet that about 60 people were taken to area hospitals, and there were five confirmed dead at the scene.

About 60 patients have been transported to three area hospitals in Westmoreland County due to multi-vehicle crash on @PA_Turnpike at milepost 86 westbound. Coroner has confirmed five fatalities. An 86-mile stretch of Turnpike still closed from New Stanton to Breezewood exits. — Carl DeFebo (@cdefebo) January 5, 2020

Somerset Hospital said in a statement that it treated and released 18 patients involved in the crash.

DeFebo said that the turnpike will likely undergo a “prolonged closure,” adding that officers were still at the scene of the incident.

Officials are still investigating the cause of the multi-vehicle crash.

The crash took place in Westmoreland County near Pittsburgh on the westbound side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Although the crash happened on the westbound side, debris from the collision made it to the eastbound side of the road.

The crash shut down 86 miles of highway from New Stanton to Breezewood in both directions, USA Today reported.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf tweeted Sunday that he was “saddened” to hear about the fatalities caused by the crash.

"In the race to replace far-left Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Party chief, Jess Phillips has staked out a Hard Remain position, vowing to “fight” to rejoin the European Union as leader.

The Member of Parliament for Birmingham Yardley, who announced on Friday her bid to replace septuagenarian socialist Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party, told the BBC that as leader she would continue to make the argument for the United Kingdom to be a part of the European Union.

“If it’s safer, more economically viable, to be in the EU, I will fight for that, regardless of how difficult that argument is to make”, Phillips insisted.

“As somebody who has a Leave seat but campaigned for Remain, I thought it was the best thing for the people. I am not going just to just change my mind on that,” she vowed.

The MP’s comments were ridiculed by Rupert Lowe, a Brexit Party MEP, who wrote on Twitter that her Remainer stance would further alienate working-class voters.

“If the next Labour leader goes into any election backing ‘rejoin’ then they have learnt absolutely nothing. They just sacrificed their working-class support and look where it got them”, Lowe wrote.

“Let’s hope they’re stupid enough to go for it!”

Ms Phillips’s comments on Brexit come in contrast to her opponent in the leadership race, millionaire lawyer Sir Keir Starmer, who has said that “the argument has to move on and we the Labour Party need to accept that Leave/Remain, that divide, goes in a few weeks time”.

“This election blew away the argument for a second referendum, rightly or wrongly, and we have to adjust to that situation”, Starmer added — although he has made similar claims about accepting Brexit before pushing to overturn it before.

Also this week, Jess Phillips lashed out at President Donald Trump over his handling of Iran, declaring that “I would have absolutely no problem in confronting Donald Trump”.

“Because the reason it feels reckless, the reason it feels dangerous, is because the faith that we have currently in the current Commander-in-Chief is we don’t know what the plan is. What’s his plan in taking this action, what plans are there for if it escalates, what are the diplomatic plans as well as interventionist plans?”

The timetable for the Labour leadership contest will be outlined by the party on Monday.

"The Islamic Centre of England in Maida Vale, Kilburn, London, has held a mass memorial for slain Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Qasem Soleimani.

Soleimani, who as leader of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had been held responsible for directing the activities of Iran’s proxy militias and other assets in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, and for fomenting the recent siege of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

Consequently, he was eliminated by a U.S. drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump, along with Kataib Hezbollah founder Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis.

The Iranian, described as the “Osama bin Laden of the Shiite world” by Aaron Klein, was described as an “honourable Islamic commander” by Islamic Centre of England director Seyed Hashem Moosavi in an official message of condolence.

Aaron Klein: Soleimani Was ‘Bin Laden of Shiite World,’ Killing Him Prevents Another Benghazihttps://t.co/UZfBDDVJ8l — Aaron Klein (@AaronKleinShow) January 3, 2020

The message of condolence praised Soleimani as a man “consistently present on the battlefield with the devils and the diabolic powers of the world” who “did not stop his struggle for one moment”.

“May God bless Haj Ghasem!” it declared.

“On the occasion of his martyrdom and that of his entourage, especially the great mujahid of Islam the honourable Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, I offer my condolences and my congratulations to the Imam al-Mahdi (a). I also extend my condolences to the great leader of Iran, Aytollah Khamenei, to the family members of the martyrs, and to the admirable nations of Iran and Iraq,” it concluded, with the director signing off as the “Representative of Ayatollah al- Uzma Sayyid Ali Khamenei (May Allah give him long life)”.

Mourners “squeezed” into the Islamic Centre to attend the memorial for Soleimani and his entourage, according to a MailOnline report, accompanied by pictures of large crowds gathered both within and without the building and and an officiant standing behind a portrait of the commander and Al-Muhandis.

Breitbart London reported on Saturday that the Muslim population of England surpassed three million in 2016, greater than the total populations of Wales and Northern Ireland — although most adhere to Sunni sects of Islam, while the Islamic Republic of Iran is Shiite.

"The United Kingdom defended the actions of the Trump administration in Iran, saying the United States is “entitled to defend itself” against Iranian aggression and deploying the Royal Navy to the Persian Gulf to protect shipping vessels flying the British flag.

The Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, expressed support for America’s decision to take out Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Qasem Soleimani, citing the violence committed in Iraq by Iran-backed militias.

“During the last few months U.S. forces in Iraq, who are based in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, have been repeatedly attacked by Iranian-backed militia”, Wallace said, in comments reported by The Telegraph.

“General Soleimani has been at the heart of the use of proxies to undermine neighbouring sovereign nations and target Iran’s enemies. Under international law the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens”, the Defence Secretary concluded.

In response to escalating tensions after the death of Soleimani, the United Kingdom has deployed the Royal Navy to the Strait of Hormuz, to protect British shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf from retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Royal Navy warships have not patrolled the strait since November, when the navy had been protecting British ships after Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in July of last year. The ship was finally released by Iran in September.

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Dominic Raab, speaking today to the BBC, also defended the killing of Soleimani.

“My view is — and the operational assessment has been done by the Americans — is that there is a right of self-defence,” Raab said.

“It was General Soleimani’s job description to engage proxies, militias across not just Iraq but the whole region, not just to destabilize those countries but to attack Western countries… In those circumstances, the right of self-defence clearly applies”, he added.

On Saturday the British Foreign Office warned British citizens not to travel to Iraq, where the United Kingdom still has 400 military personnel stationed, for fear of Iranian reprisals, saying that British citizens “could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran”.

The defence by the United Kingdom of President Trump’s actions against Iran comes in stark contrast to the response of other European nations, many of whom have shied away from supporting America.

Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State for the United States, chastised the country’s supposed allies in Europe for not supporting the strike against Soleimani.

“[I have been] talking to our partners in other places that haven’t been quite as good — frankly, the Europeans haven’t been as helpful as I wish that they could be”, said Pompeo.

“The Brits, the French, the Germans, all need to understand that what we did, what the Americans did, saved lives in Europe as well… We’re not going to appease [Iran] any longer”, he added.

Jeremy Corbyn, the 70-year-old far-left leader of Britain’s Labour Party — who referred to the killing of Soleimani as a “U.S. assassination” — has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene the Privy Council and denounced the “belligerent actions and rhetoric” actions of the United States.

“The U.S. assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani is an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict in the Middle East with global significance”, he said.

"The United Kingdom defended the actions of the Trump administration in Iran, saying the United States is “entitled to defend itself” against Iranian aggression and deploying the Royal Navy to the Persian Gulf to protect shipping vessels flying the British flag.

The Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, expressed support for America’s decision to take out Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Qasem Soleimani, citing the violence committed in Iraq by Iran-backed militias.

“During the last few months U.S. forces in Iraq, who are based in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, have been repeatedly attacked by Iranian-backed militia”, Wallace said, in comments reported by The Telegraph.

“General Soleimani has been at the heart of the use of proxies to undermine neighbouring sovereign nations and target Iran’s enemies. Under international law the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens”, the Defence Secretary concluded.

In response to escalating tensions after the death of Soleimani, the United Kingdom has deployed the Royal Navy to the Strait of Hormuz, to protect British shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf from retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Royal Navy warships have not patrolled the strait since November, when the navy had been protecting British ships after Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in July of last year. The ship was finally released by Iran in September.

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Dominic Raab, speaking today to the BBC, also defended the killing of Soleimani.

“My view is — and the operational assessment has been done by the Americans — is that there is a right of self-defence,” Raab said.

“It was General Soleimani’s job description to engage proxies, militias across not just Iraq but the whole region, not just to destabilize those countries but to attack Western countries… In those circumstances, the right of self-defence clearly applies”, he added.

On Saturday the British Foreign Office warned British citizens not to travel to Iraq, where the United Kingdom still has 400 military personnel stationed, for fear of Iranian reprisals, saying that British citizens “could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran”.

"The district court of Leipzig has ordered warrants for the arrest of four far-left extremists accused of assaulting police officers and engaging in bodily harm on New Year’s Eve.

The four extremists, aged 27, 29, 30 and 32-years-old, were taken before a judge earlier this week after being arrested in connection with violent riots in the Connewitzer Kreuz area, a noted far-left stronghold in the city, German tabloid Bild reports.

The main arrest warrant was issued against a 27-year-old extremist who is accused of assaulting several law enforcement officials and the other three are being held in custody because none of them has fixed addresses and police say they could flee the area.

The State Criminal Police Office (LKA) and its specialized far-left extremism division (LinX) say they are still investigating the serious assault on a police officer by an unknown individual. It is being treated as an attempted murder case.

The 38-year-old officer who was the victim in the attack was forced to undergo surgery at a local hospital on New Year’s Eve. Police described the operation as being an emergency, but some hospital staff have countered the claim, stating that the surgery was on the officer’s ear and was not life-threatening.

Leipzig police chief Torsten Schultze told the tabloid he thought the semantic debate of whether the operation was an emergency or not was “disgraceful.”

“An official was seriously injured and had to be operated on. That’s bad enough,” he said.

Leipzig has become a hub of far-left Antifa extremism in recent months with the city seeing a total of 357 attacks in 2019. One, an arson attack, caused over ten million euros’ worth of damages.

German Police Union (DPolG) federal chairman Rainer Wendt commented on the rise in violence, saying that a group similar to the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF) — who were notorious for bombings and targeted killings — could emerge in the near future.

“Left-wing Internet blogs and alternative media sites, in particular, are making no secret of their desire to violently resist the political system,” he said.

"Authorities in Sweden have been accused of mislabelling explosions and bombings and classifying incidents as “damage” in order to distort the true extent of explosions across the country.

Swedish Minister of Justice Morgan Johansson took to Twitter on Thursday to state that bombings in the multicultural city of Malmö had decreased by 40 per cent in the last two years despite other statistics showing a large rise in bombings across the country.

But according to the alternative news website Samhallsnytt, several explosive incidents in Malmö over 2019 were classified by police as injuries or simply as damage.

Sweden saw a large rise in the number of explosions and bombings last year, an estimated 236 incidents in the first 11 months of 2019. https://t.co/Joom3lrkVP — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 1, 2020

In January, an explosive that was detonated between two taxis in the city was declared to be “damage,” while in April an explosion at a school was logged as an “injury.”

An explosion at a residential building in June was also considered an “injury.” Broadcaster SVT reported that the explosion was not counted on their list of 2019 explosions because the damage caused by the blast was too minor.

Some Swedes reacted to Johansson’s Tweet with scepticism, including user Pater Ohman who accused Johansson of selecting a small portion of statistics on purpose rather than addressing the national trend.

He said the minister was sweeping the situation “under the carpet.”

The accusations of manipulating statistics come only weeks after employees of the Swedish Crime Prevention Council (Brå) claimed they had been pressured by members of management to manipulate crime figures for political reasons.

“If results were not liked, then there was censorship, organisation of results, dimming of results, and highlighting other parts of a study that were not as sensitive or could show a positive result,” an employee told researchers at Linköping University.

In 2016 soon after the height of the 2015 migrant crisis, Varg Gyllandar of the Stockholm Police claimed that officers practised a form of self-censorship when it came to migrant sex attacks at music festivals.

“We didn’t cover up, of course we didn’t. But we didn’t tell. And there are so many things we don’t tell because we have so much information, so many things going on,” Gyllandar revealed.

“Well, I think we all carry a bit of self-censorship; that we are afraid of discussing these question because you can appear like a racist. This is a cultural thing for us. We do go there… that’s maybe a problem,” he added.

"A British employment tribunal has ruled that “ethical veganism” is a philosophical belief and should be protected by law from discrimination.

The ruling came about during a case brought by ethical vegan Jordi Casamitjana, who claimed that he was fired by his employer, the League Against Cruel Sports, because of his lifestyle preference.

While vegans abstain from eating any animal products — including meat, dairy, and even honey — ethical vegans attempt to exclude all forms of using animals or their products, including avoiding products tested on animals or clothing made of leather or wool.

In this case, Mr Casamitjana claimed he was fired for disclosing to staff that the company’s pension fund was investing in firms that undertake animal testing. The League Against Cruel Sports, which as the name suggests is an animal rights charity, said that the former employee was sacked for gross misconduct and that his veganism had nothing to do with it.

Judge Robin Postle is yet to rule on Casamitjana’s dismissal, but said ethical veganism counts as a “religion or belief” protected under the Equality Act 2010, and that it was “important” and “worthy” of respect in a democratic society, as defined by the criteria of the law.

“I am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief,” Judge Postle said from the tribual court in Norwich, according to the BBC.

UK Judge Rules Belief That ‘Men Cannot Change Into Women’ Is ‘Not Worthy of Respect In a Democratic Society’ https://t.co/GU41SeSHxo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 19, 2019

Mr Casamitjana’s lawyer Peter Daly said that the ruling will have a “potentially significant” impact, saying that perceived hateful comments directed at ethical vegans “might be seen to be harassment in the same way a racist or sexist slur might be discriminatory action”.

BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said that while the ruling has no binding legal precedent, it could open doors to other court challenges against other employers or educators, suggesting that climate change fanatics could attempt to have their philosophical beliefs protected from discrimination.

Journalist Toby Young pointed out the hypocrisy of one British judge ruling that ethical veganism was a belief worthy of respect in modern Britain while another ruled that believing there are two, unchangeable genders is not.

Mr Young said: “So ‘ethical veganism’ is a ‘philosophical belief’ protected by the Equality Act, but believing in the biological reality of sex is not. I don’t think case law is going to do the job of clarifying what beliefs are and aren’t protected by the Equality Act. [It] needs to be amended.”

In December, another judge in an employment tribunal ruled against a woman who claimed she was discriminated against and subsequently fired for tweeting that “men cannot change into women”.

Judge Taylor argued that tax specialist and feminist Maya Forstater was not afforded rights under the Equalities Act 2010, and her dismissal from the Centre for Global Development was legal, saying that her belief “is incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others”.

“If a person has transitioned from male to female and has a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), that person is legally a woman. That is not something [Ms Forstater] is entitled to ignore. [Ms Forstater’s] position is that even if a trans woman has a GRC, she cannot honestly describe herself as a woman. That belief is not worthy of respect in a democratic society,” Taylor said.

"Britain’s prospects under Boris Johnson are obviously much, much better than they would have been under Jeremy Corbyn. But there’s one area especially, I fear, where this Conservative administration is going to come seriously unstuck.

It’s climate change and energy policy, obviously.

On its current trajectory, Britain’s destabilised grid system is heading for more and more blackouts like the ones that caused chaos last August, stopping trains and seriously inconveniencing over one million people.

Ofgem — the industry regulator — has now fined the three electricity companies responsible a total of £10.5 million.

But this needs to be seen for what it is — a cover-up designed to distract from the serious, long term problems facing Britain’s electricity system as a direct result of the government’s embrace of renewable energy.

The more intermittent, unreliable renewables that are connected to the grid, the more unstable it will grow.

Delingpole: Boris Johnson's Looming Wind Disaster https://t.co/wkPEvy2O6M — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 12, 2019

Last year’s blackout was caused when Hornsea wind farm tripped offline as a result of a lightning strike, followed shortly afterwards by an outage at a smaller, gas-fired station.

The National Grid claimed that this was a “rare and unusual event, that has happened only three times in thirty years.”

But wind and solar weren’t nearly such a significant part of the grid back then. As the salutary example of South Australia’s Great Green Energy Disaster suggests, these outages are likely to become the new normal.

The obvious solution to Britain’s energy problems — highlighted by the oil price spike caused by the Soleimani assassination — is to frack the rich seams of shale all over the country and experience a taste of America’s energy independence.

Unfortunately, Johnson’s administration has more or less caved to the environmentalists on shale gas; and Boris has furthermore committed himself to the on-the-hoof, well-poisoning Net Zero by 2050 policy dreamed up in the dog days of his disastrous predecessor Theresa May.

Something will have to give, at some stage.

Britain will eventually have to choose between the expensive green virtue-signalling urged, inter alia, by Michael Gove, discredited former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and Telegraph house eco-loon financial writers Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner.

Or keeping the lights on and stopping people — the working classes who voted Tory at the last election, for example — being driven into energy poverty.

Gosh, it’s going to be a toughie. Who to side with: the remote, unaccountable elite or ordinary working folk?

Why, the divide is so similar you’d almost imagine that Brexit had never gone away….

Unfortunately, Johnson’s administration has more or less caved to the environmentalists on shale gas; and Boris has furthermore committed himself to the on-the-hoof, well-poisoning Net Zero by 2050 policy dreamed up in the dog days of his disastrous predecessor Theresa May.

Something will have to give, at some stage.

Britain will eventually have to choose between the expensive green virtue-signalling urged, inter alia, by Michael Gove, discredited former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and Telegraph house eco-loon financial writers Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner.

Or keeping the lights on and stopping people — the working classes who voted Tory at the last election, for example — being driven into energy poverty.

Gosh, it’s going to be a toughie. Who to side with: the remote, unaccountable elite or ordinary working folk?

Why, the divide is so similar you’d almost imagine that Brexit had never gone away….

The Interior Ministry confirmed a media report Saturday that revised guidance has been circulated to police in Germany’s 16 states so they can take “appropriate security measures” to protect American and Jewish facilities.

The ministry provided no details on the guidance disseminated by the Federal Police Office.

"On Sunday’s broadcast of ABC’s “This Week,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) accused President Donald Trump’s administration of being “engaged in a massive cover-up.”

The New York Democrat was referring to the evidence Democrats want to be presented during the Senate impeachment trial.

Schumer said, “If the president is acquitted through a sham trial, through a mock trial, where there are no witnesses, where everything is covered up that will not be— that will not stand him well with the American people. And it will not stand the Republicans with the American people.”

He continued, “I have never heard a senate leader say I’m taking my orders from the White House. The White House is engaged in a massive cover-up. Americans are asking, what are they afraid of? What are they afraid of?”

He added, “The bottom line is very simple. We need the truth, not a cover-up, not a sham, not to have some nationally televised mock trial where there’s no evidence.”

Schumer said, “I really worry the actions the president took will get us into what he calls another “endless war” in the Middle East. He promised we wouldn’t have that. I think we’re closer to that now because of his actions. Look, there are so many questions that are unanswered that have to be answered.

North Korea, they’re much stronger than they were when he started. In Syria, he messed up. Every encounter he has with Putin, he loses. So, I’m really worried, and that’s why Congress must assert itself. I don’t believe the president has authority to go to war in Iraq without congressional approval.”

He added, “I’ll do everything I can to assert our authority. We don’t need this president either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.

"Saturday during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) explained how even though the Iranians have vowed retaliation against the United States for the drone strike that killed Qasam Soleimani, they have other serious domestic problems with which to be concerned that threaten the stability of the regime.

Meadows told FNC’s Jeanine Pirro he saw the Iranian economy imploding, given its double-digit unemployment.

“Well, they better take it serious. I can tell you, Judge, one of the interesting things, this is not just a tweet. Everybody was talking about the President. And he made a decisive action, an action that should have been taken. We’ve now taken out two of the top terrorist, manipulators, and generals in the last three months, in about three months. And it’s because this President has been willing to take the action. But here’s the interesting thing is, when we took out this general, we had already identified these targets. This is not just a tweet. Everybody is talking about retaliation. And we should be vigilant. We should be cautious. But the risk of not doing things is certainly greater than the risk of taking this action that the President so rightly took just a few days ago.”

“And so I can tell you that who should be worried about this is the Iranians, the Iranian government. This is not about a regime change. But if you talk about double-digit unemployment, their economy is imploding. Here’s what we do know. We will strike back. And we will strike back appropriately.

"On Sunday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Up,” 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said President Donald Trump is a “very small man,” who is creating a foreign policy crisis in Iran.

Booker said, “We have seen a drift of war powers since 2001’s authorization on use of military force. And this isn’t a right or left issue. Republican, President, Bush, Democrat President Obama, you’ve seen the expansion of war presidents now, which is undermining our constitutional checks and balances. The difference now the war powers lie in the hands of someone who has shown he has no impulse control. He can’t even control himself with a reporter’s question or a freshman congressperson. He has been doing decisions that counteract his advice of his generals.”

He continued, “This is a crisis. Every day that he is commander-in-chief –this is a crisis for our country that we have someone in there that at a time we need big people who have restraint who are strategic in their thinking, we have a very small man who has impulse control. That makes decisions without strategy that put our men and women in this country in greater and greater risk.”

He added, “It is dangerous now to allow the president of the United States to grow in war powers undermining the checks and balances because you may have a sober, deliberative president like President Obama but the next one can an impulsive, capricious, un-strategic thinker like President Trump.”

"President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran on Twitter on Saturday, warning them against further retaliation against the United States.

Trump reminded Iranian leaders he had spent two trillion dollars restoring the might of the American military.

“We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World!” he wrote. “If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way…and without hesitation!”

The president commented as critics of his decision to eliminate General Qasem Soleimani continued warning Iran was preparing retaliatory strikes against American targets in the Middle East.

But Trump repeated any additional Iranian attacks would be met with unmatched force.

“They attacked us, and we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!” he wrote.

Trump shared a comment on Twitter from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) who defended the president’s drone strike, noting that the first step of a defensive strategy against terrorism was to stop allowing attacks against the United States go unanswered.

Crenshaw featured an interview with former Gen. David Petraeus who described Trump’s action as “more significant” than killing of Osama bin Laden or Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

“This is a very significant effort to reestablish deterrence, which obviously had not been shored up by the relatively insignificant responses up until now,” Petraeus said about Trump’s decision.

Trump continued to warn Iran from revenge against the United States, noting that he had already targeted 52 Iranian sites for retaliatory military strikes. He described the targets as “very high level” that were important to Iran and Iranian culture.

“[T]hose targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD,” Trump wrote. “The USA wants no more threats!”

"On Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union,” 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questioned if President Donald Trump’s reasons for the Qasem Soleimani assassination was to distract from impeachment.

Warren said, “I think that the question that we ought to focus on is why now? Why not a month ago, and why not a month from now? And the answer from the administration seems to be that they can’t keep their story straight on this. They pointed in all different directions. And you know, the last time that we watched them do this was the summer over Ukraine. As soon as people started asking about the conversations between Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine and why aid had been held up to Ukraine, the administration did the same thing. They pointed in all directions of what was going on. And of course, what emerged then is that this is Donald Trump just trying to advance Donald Trump’s own political agenda. Not the agenda of the United States of America. So what happens right now? Next week, the president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he is deeply upset about that. I think that people are reasonably asking why this moment? Why does he pick now to take this highly inflammatory, highly dangerous action that moves us closer to war? We have been at war for 20 years in the Middle East, and we need to stop the war this the Middle East and not expand it.”

Tapper asked, “Are you suggesting that President Trump pulled the trigger and had Qasem Soleimani killed as a distraction from impeachment?”

Warren said, “Look, I think that people are reasonably asking about the timing and why it is that the administration seems to have all kinds of different answers. In the first 48 hours after this attack, what did we hear? Well, we heard it was for an imminent attack, and then we heard, no, no, it is to prevent any future attack, and then we heard that it is from the vice president himself and no, it is related to 9/11, and then we heard from president reports of people in the intelligence community saying that the whole, that the threat was overblown. You know, when the administration doesn’t seem to have a coherent answer for taking a step like this. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, a step that puts everyone at risk, and step that puts the military at risk and puts the diplomats in the region at risk. And we have already paid a huge price for this war. Thousands of American lives lost, and a cost that we have paid domestically and around the world. At the same time, look at what it has done in the Middle East, millions of people who have been killed, who have been injured, who have been displaced. So this is not a moment when the president should be escalating tensions and moving us to war. The job of the president is to keep us safe, and that means move back from the edge.”

Tapper pressed, “Do you believe that President Trump pulled the trigger on this operation as a way to distract from impeachment? Is that what you think?”

Warren said, “I think it is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration immediately after having taken this decision offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what is going on.”

She continued, “I think it is the right question to ask. We will get more information as we go forward but look at the timing on this. Look at what Donald Trump has said afterward and his administration. They have pointed in multiple directions. There is a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago and not a month from now, not a less aggressive and less dangerous response. He had a whole range of responses that were presented to him. He didn’t pick one of the other ones. He picked the most aggressive and the one that moves us closer to war. So what does everybody talk about today? Are we going to war? Are we going to have another five years, tens, ten years of war in the Middle East, and dragged in once again. Are we bringing another generation of young people into war? That is every bit of the conversation right now. Donald Trump has taken an extraordinarily reckless step, and we have seen it before, he is using foreign policy and uses whatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump.”

"(UPI) — Al-Shabab, a Somali terror group linked to al-Qaeda, attacked a military base Sunday morning in Kenya that houses some American military personnel, U.S. and Kenyan military said.

Al-Shabab is a Sunni Muslim group and is not linked to Shiite Iran. Last week, a U.S. airstrike killed Iran’s top military commander and Iran vowed retaliation.

At approximately 5:30 a.m., Kenya Defense Forces said terrorists attempted to breach security at the Manda Bay Airfield, which is near the border with Somalia. “The attempted breach was successfully repulsed. Four terrorists bodies have so far been found,” the Kenyan military posted on Twitter.

U.S. Africa Commandsaid the airfield has been “cleared and still in the process of being full secured.” There was damage to the infrastructure and equipment, and a check of personnel is underway.

“U.S. Africa Command acknowledges there was an attack at Manda Bay Airfield, Kenya and is monitoring the situation,” U.S Army Maj. Gen. William Gayler said in a statement. “Al-Shabab resorts to lies, coercion, and the exertion of force to bolster their reputation to create false headlines … It is important to counter al-Shabab where they stand to prevent the spread of this cancer.”

Earlier, al-Shabab said some of its fighters had launched “a daring dawn raid on a U.S. naval base known as ‘Camp Simba’ in Lamu County, Kenya,” according to the Tasnim News Agency in Iran.

Camp Simba is near the Manda Airstrip and where Western visitors to Kenya frequently visit.

Their fighters had taken control of a portion of the base and there were “severe casualties on both American and Kenyan troops stationed there.”

AFRICOM said the group has been “exaggerating the security situation on the ground.”

No number of Americans at the base was given.

The base been a site for U.S. special operations forces operating in Somalia. About 500 U.S. troops are in Somalia to assist and advise the nation’s military against the terror group.

“Al-Shabab is a brutal terrorist organization,” Gayler said. “It is an Al-Qaeda affiliate seeking to establish a self-governed Islamic territory in East Africa, to remove Western influence and ideals from the region, and to further its jihadist agenda. U.S. presence in Africa is critically important to counter-terrorism efforts.”

Africom noted this is the same terror group killed 80 people in Mogadishu, Somalia, last week.

The Somali government and U.S. Africa Command have conducted retaliatory airstrikes on al-Shabab target recently, according to a CNN report.",Terrorists Attack Military Base in Kenya Hosting U.S. Soldiers,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/01/05/terrorists-attack-military-base-in-kenya-hosting-u-s-soldiers/,2020-01-05T00:00:00
"(UPI) — Al-Shabab, a Somali terror group linked to al-Qaeda, attacked a military base Sunday morning in Kenya that houses some American military personnel, U.S. and Kenyan military said.

Al-Shabab is a Sunni Muslim group and is not linked to Shiite Iran. Last week, a U.S. airstrike killed Iran’s top military commander and Iran vowed retaliation.

At approximately 5:30 a.m., Kenya Defense Forces said terrorists attempted to breach security at the Manda Bay Airfield, which is near the border with Somalia. “The attempted breach was successfully repulsed. Four terrorists bodies have so far been found,” the Kenyan military posted on Twitter.

U.S. Africa Commandsaid the airfield has been “cleared and still in the process of being full secured.” There was damage to the infrastructure and equipment, and a check of personnel is underway.

“U.S. Africa Command acknowledges there was an attack at Manda Bay Airfield, Kenya and is monitoring the situation,” U.S Army Maj. Gen. William Gayler said in a statement. “Al-Shabab resorts to lies, coercion, and the exertion of force to bolster their reputation to create false headlines … It is important to counter al-Shabab where they stand to prevent the spread of this cancer.”

Earlier, al-Shabab said some of its fighters had launched “a daring dawn raid on a U.S. naval base known as ‘Camp Simba’ in Lamu County, Kenya,” according to the Tasnim News Agency in Iran.

Camp Simba is near the Manda Airstrip and where Western visitors to Kenya frequently visit.

Their fighters had taken control of a portion of the base and there were “severe casualties on both American and Kenyan troops stationed there.”

AFRICOM said the group has been “exaggerating the security situation on the ground.”

No number of Americans at the base was given.

The base been a site for U.S. special operations forces operating in Somalia. About 500 U.S. troops are in Somalia to assist and advise the nation’s military against the terror group.

“Al-Shabab is a brutal terrorist organization,” Gayler said. “It is an Al-Qaeda affiliate seeking to establish a self-governed Islamic territory in East Africa, to remove Western influence and ideals from the region, and to further its jihadist agenda. U.S. presence in Africa is critically important to counter-terrorism efforts.”

"Iraqi MPs passed a resolution Sunday calling for all foreign troops to leave the country after the U.S. eliminated top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad airport last week.

Parliament in Baghdad also called for a ban on foreign forces using Iraqi land, airspace or water for any reason.

The U.S. has some 5,000 military personnel in Iraq, mainly as advisers, while the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and a host of other countries also contribute military to help train local Iraqi forces.

“The government commits to revoke its request for assistance from the international coalition fighting Islamic State due to the end of military operations in Iraq and the achievement of victory,” the resolution read.

“The Iraqi government must work to end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, airspace or water for any reason.”

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi had earlier called on parliament to end foreign troop presence.

Speaking at the beginning of the session, Abdul Mahdi said he recommended parliament take urgent measures to remove foreign troops, a move he said was in the interest of both Iraq and the United States, Reuters reported.

“Despite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,” Abdul Mahdi told parliament.

Abdul Mahdi called the U.S. killing of Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis a political assassination, according to Reuters.

The resolution before the parliament on Sunday specifically calls for ending an agreement in which Washington sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State group.

The resolution is backed by most Shiite members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats.

"Former NFL quarterback and original anthem protester Colin Kaepernick, accused the United States military of terrorist attacks” against “Black and Brown bodies,” and referred to our nation’s service members as plunderers of the “non white world.”

Kaepernick made the statement on Saturday in a pair of tweets posted on Saturday, in an apparent response to the American attack that killed Iranian IRGC General Qasem Soleimani on Thursday.

There is nothing new about American terrorist attacks against Black and Brown people for the expansion of American imperialism. — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) January 4, 2020

America has always sanctioned and besieged Black and Brown bodies both at home and abroad. America militarism is the weapon wielded by American imperialism, to enforce its policing and plundering of the non white world. — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) January 4, 2020

The attack was ordered after Soleimani engaged in a long series of atrocities against American military members and civilians in the Middle East, culminating in an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last week.

Part of the media’s narrative in defending Kaepernick had been that, although he refused to stand in respect of the national anthem, the former 49er was not protesting against the military and never meant any disrespect towards the military.

However, in accusing the military of plundering “Black and Brown bodies” in a quest to plunder the “non white world,” it’s hard to make the case that he’s not accusing the military of being a willing partner in what he views as a racist and imperialist empire.

Kaepernick’s tweets on Saturday are only the most recent of his actions which defy the media narrative surrounding his protests. Another key media talking point was that Kaepernick had never meant to disrespect the flag with his protests. However, the league’s original anthem protester gave lie to that spin when he successfully lobbied Nike to pull their “Betsy Ross Flag themed sneakers last summer.

"President Trump engaged in an “act of war” by issuing the airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, wrote Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) Friday.

The Democrat congresswoman tweeted:

Last night the President engaged in what is widely being recognized as an act of war against Iran, one that now risks the lives of millions of innocent people. Now is the moment to prevent war & protect innocent people – the question for many is how, publicly & Congressionally: — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 3, 2020

Friday, Trump defended the airstrike that killed the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force by stating that it was done to prevent a conflict, not start one.

“We took action last night to stop a war, we did not take action to start a war,” he said, adding that “Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion. We remember and honor the victims of Soleimani’s many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.”

In a subsequent tweet, Ocasio-Cortez urged her followers not to fall for the message of so-called “war advocates”:

War advocates start off saying “we all want peace, but…” or “it’s too late…” & frame a pro-peace agenda as naïve to realpolitik. Don’t give into this gaslighting. The same folks selling us Iraq and selling us this latest provocation of violence. We cannot repeat this cycle. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 3, 2020

However, critics have failed to recognize that Iran has been the aggressor, not the United States, according to Breitbart News’s Joel B. Pollak.

Friday, he wrote:

Moreover, Soleimani’s death actually improves the prospects for peace by encouraging the Iranian people to stand up against their rulers. The message to the Iranian people was clear: America is not against you, but against your oppressors. As if to help Trump, Iranian state TV reportedly stopped all programming to broadcast tributes to Soleimani. The Iranian people know: Trump cares more about them than their leaders do.

Phillip Smyth, an expert at the Washington Institute on Iran-controlled Shia militias and the Middle East, recently called Soleimani’s death a “major blow” to the Iranian regime.

“I would argue that this is probably the most major decapitation strike the United States has ever carried out. … This is a man who controlled a transnational foreign legion that was controlling governments in numerous different countries,” Smyth said.

“It’s an incredible two-fer,” he commented. “This is another one of those old hands. These guys don’t grow on trees. It takes time.”",Ocasio-Cortez Claims Trump Engaged in ‘Act of War’ by Killing Soleimani,http://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/01/04/ocasio-cortez-claims-trump-engaged-in-act-of-war-by-killing-soleimani/,2020-01-04T00:00:00
"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Dozens were injured in clashes between protesters and security forces in central Beirut on Saturday, one of the most violent nights since anti-government demonstrations started in October.

Security forces used teargas, water cannon and rubber bullets to push protesters , who pelted them with rocks and firecrackers, away from the main sit-in site and government buildings in the capital city.

Lebanese demonstrators battle riot police in Beirut on Saturday.

The Lebanese Civil Defense and the Red Cross said they transferred 46 people to hospitals and treated the wounds of dozens others on site during hours of clashes.

Many of the protest chants were directed at caretaker Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri who is widely expected to be named head of the next government during parliamentary consultations on Monday.

Other chants targeted caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, a major ally of the militant and political group Hezbollah. Bassil announced on Thursday that his party would not participate in the next government.

"(CNN) The nuclear deal painstakingly negotiated by the international community with Iran has become the first victim of the crisis provoked by the killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in a US drone attack.

But while declaring its independence from the JCPOA, Iran has not articulated any intention to race towards weapons-grade uranium.

After a cabinet meeting in Tehran, Iran announced Sunday that it would no longer limit itself to the restrictions contained in the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA. The deal was implemented in 2016, freezing Iran's nuclear program in return for a progressive lifting of international sanctions.

The announcement said ""Iran will set its limits based on its technical needs,"" essentially rendering the JCPOA redundant if technically still alive.

It was the fifth step in Iran's graduated divorce from the nuclear deal, the latest stage in a gradual chipping away at its provisions that began last July in response to US withdrawal from the deal and re-imposition of tough sanctions.

Essentially Iran no longer recognizes any limits on the operational aspects of its nuclear program; including in enrichment capacity, the extent (or degree) of enrichment, and nuclear research and development.

In other words, Iran is prepared to let its nuclear centrifuges spin.

But it also held out an olive branch. Foreign Minister Mohamed Javid Zarif tweeted: ""This step is within JCPOA & all 5 steps are reversible upon EFFECTIVE implementation of reciprocal obligations. Iran's full cooperation w/IAEA will continue.""

A separate statement said Iran would ""continue to work with international nuclear agencies and will return to JCPOA limits once all sanctions are removed from the country.""

Analysts noted that even as the JCPOA lurches towards irrelevance, Iran has shown a measure of self-restraint.

Hans Kristensen, Director of Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists said ""This does not (yet) mean Iran is leaving JCPOA or building nuclear weapons.""

""Apparently, other limits of agreement are still in place as is IAEA inspections,"" Kristensen tweeted.

""Its 5th step away from its JCPOA commitments is less harsh than the initially feared resumption of 20% enrichment,"" tweeted Ali Vaez, Director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. ""This shows Iran still wants the Europeans on its side and doesn't want to break the deal yet.""

Eric Brewer, a former official at the US National Security Council, agreed. He told CNN: ""They've clearly left themselves room to maneuver,"" Brewer said. ""And they clearly chose not to come out with something more aggressive in the wake of Soleimani's death - like increasing enrichment to 20%.""

Brewer said that the bigger question ""is whether Iran acts on this announcement by adding more centrifuges."" That could potentially push it closer to developing a nuclear weapon.

What matters is what Iran does next.

Michael Singh, a senior director at the Washington Institute and formerly a senior director for the Middle East at the NSC, told CNN: ""If it is just an announcement in principle, that they do not consider themselves bound by the JCPOA, it will be met with a shrug by the US and others."" But ""If they follow it up and take actions to increase the levels by which they enrich uranium or increase their stockpile that will actually bring down the breakout time.""

Vipin Narang, Associate Professor of Political Science at MIT, points out that despite Iran's announcement that it won't abide by enrichment levels and quantities set by the JCPOA, ""it is still quite far from having enough enriched uranium for a bomb, let alone a functional arsenal because...of the JCPOA.""

A deal undone

The Trump Administration unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA on May 8, 2018.

""This was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,"" Trump said as he withdrew from the deal. ""It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.""

The other parties to the deal -- China, Russia, the Europeans and Iran -- disagreed and stayed the course. But the reimposition of draconian sanctions by the US, sanctions that had been largely lifted as Iran's reward for signing up to the deal, gnawed away at its credibility.

As tensions grew, the agreement known as the JCPOA began to fray at the edges.

The Trump administration's policy of ""maximum pressure"" against Iran, which began after that May statement, included crippling sanctions against its financial and oil sectors. President Hassan Rouhani said last week that the US ""economic war"" against Iran had cost the country $200 billion. Iran has lost nearly 90% of its oil exports, a key source of revenue; the value of the rial has plummeted, and the banking sector is under stress. Even though the sanctions exempted essential supplies, widespread shortages of food, medicine and medicinal goods have been reported throughout Iran

Tehran responded to the US measures with what it called ""strategic patience"" -- while nagging the Europeans to make up for the effect of US sanctions.

President Emmanuel Macron of France tried to smooth the waters, proposing a $15 billion credit line for Iran in return for its full adherence to the JCPOA. He also welcomed Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the G7 meeting in August and tried to engineer a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the UN General assembly.

But the dynamics were moving in the opposite direction. As the noose tightened on Iran's oil exports, it retaliated on several fronts: attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf (by its own or proxy forces), a growing drumbeat of rocket attacks against US forces in Iraq, and most spectacularly the cruise missile attacks against Saudi oil plants in September.

The message was simple -- if we can't sell our oil and gain the proceeds, we will try to ensure others can't either.

The reactor building at the Russian-built Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran, pictured in October 2010.

At the same time, Iran chipped away at the JCPOA. Beginning in July last year, it withdrew every two months from some part of the agreement. It exceeded agreed limits to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, and then began enriching uranium.

Essentially, Iran was responding to America's 'maximum pressure' with 'maximum resistance' -- but short of open war. The two adversaries seemed set on a ""no-peace, no-war"" course of attrition.

That remains the case after Soleimani's killing, for all the anger and cries for revenge emanating from Tehran. The Iranians and their proxies will probably seek out targets of opportunity around the world. But -- as the Iranian leadership has already stressed -- they will bide their time.

At the same time, the prognosis for the JCPOA looks poor. At best it's in intensive care; at worst it may struggle to survive the year.

There's been an almost helpless tone to European calls for restraint in the aftermath of the US drone strikes. France pleaded for Iran to ""quickly return to full compliance with its nuclear obligations and to refrain from further action to the contrary.""

On Saturday, France, Germany and China called on Iran to preserve the deal and to avoid any measure that would violate it, according to a statement from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Le Drian spoke to Germany's Heiko Maas and China's Wang Yi in separate phone calls.

There is scant chance of Iran listening in the current environment. The Europeans are nowhere near making up for the cost and dislocation caused by US sanctions, the $15 billion line of credit has gone nowhere and the Iranian economy is deep in recession. Further and deeper withdrawals from the JCPOA are likely in the months to come.

But that doesn't mean Iran will abandon the deal altogether and race towards developing a nuclear weapon. Eric Brewer and Ariane Tabatabai have written in War on the Rocks that Iranian policy is ""designed to gradually build pressure on the United States and Europe by targeting key pillars of the agreement, rather than racing for a short-notice breakout capability.""

There is still plenty of strategic patience in Tehran. In light of the country's deepening economic crisis and the sporadic flare-up of popular protests, the leadership may decide that upping the ante against the US is unaffordable, and full-scale war unsustainable.

By comparison, threatening to abandon the nuclear restraints so painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration is almost risk and cost-free.",Iran drives another stake into the heart of the nuclear deal,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/04/middleeast/iran-soleimani-nuclear-deal-intl/index.html,2020-01-04T00:00:00
"Tehran, Iran (CNN) The military adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader said Sunday that Tehran's response to the killing by the United States of its most most influential general will ""for sure be military.""

In an exclusive interview with CNN in Tehran, the adviser -- Maj. Gen. Hossein Dehghan -- made the most specific and direct threat yet by a senior Iranian official following the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad.

Dehghan said Iran would retaliate directly against US ""military sites.""

Dehghan is a former defense minister and is now the main military adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He told CNN that reprisals would come from Iran itself, not its allied militia in the region.

""It might be argued that there could be proxy operations. We can say America, Mr. Trump, has taken action directly against us -- so we take direct action against America.""

The United States has a growing military presence in the region. Thousands of US troops have been deployed to Saudi Arabia, and there are some 5,000 at bases in Iraq. The US also has a major air base in Qatar and a naval presence in Bahrain, as well as troops stationed in Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

In common with other Iranian officials, Dehghan suggested that Iran was in no hurry to retaliate and would choose its targets carefully. ""Our reaction will be wise, well considered and in time, with decisive deterrent effect.""

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had earlier said that Americans would face consequences for killing Soleimani ""not only today, but also in the coming years.""

Given the rhetoric of both sides, there is a growing risk of escalation in what has become the most dangerous confrontation between the US and Iran in decades.

Late Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that ""If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!""

The President continued: ""They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!""

Dehghan responded defiantly to Trump's warning.

""It was America that has started the war. Therefore, they should accept appropriate reactions to their actions,"" he said.

""The only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow they have inflicted. Afterward they should not seek a new cycle.""

In recent months, officials in the Trump administration and even the President himself have floated the possibility of renewed dialogue with Iran. Dehghan dismissed that possibility.

""Look, for several reasons we didn't want to negotiate with this incumbent US administration. Now, after what happened to Mr. Soleimani there is no point for negotiations or relations. It's impossible.""

'Gangster and a gambler'

Dehgahn also responded to Trump's threat to include Iranian cultural sites among 52 targets the US had selected to strike in the event of Iranian retaliation. The number was chosen to match the number of hostages taken in the 1979 takeover of the US Embassy, Trump said.

Dehghan said the tweets were ridiculous and absurd. ""If he says 52 we say 300 -- and they are accessible to us,"" Dehghan said. ""No American military staff, no American political center, no American military base, no American vessel will be safe.

""He doesn't know international law. He doesn't recognize UN resolutions either. Basically he is a veritable gangster and a gambler.""

At one point in the interview, Dehghan pulled out a picture of Soleimani and held it up to the camera.

""All Iranians are Qasem Soleimani,"" he said, and insisted the Quds force, which Soleimani had led since 2003, would not be weakened by his death. The Quds have been responsible for projecting Iranian influence across the Middle East and beyond and have played a major role in supporting the Assad regime in Syria.

""The person who has replaced him has been cooperating with him for two decades. He has the same manner and method,"" Dehghan said.

Iran's will to defend its interests ""has increased a thousand times. We don't feel anything. We have a logic, the logic of martyrdom.""

As the war of words escalates, Dehghan echoed the comments of other senior Iranian officials that the country was not seeking war.

""Let me tell you one thing: Our leadership has officially announced that we have never been seeking war and we will not be seeking war.""

But his demand that the US not respond to any reprisals by Iran for Soleimani's killing will surely fall on deaf ears. This cycle of violence accelerated when a US contractor was killed in a rocket attack on a joint US-Iraqi military base on December 29th.

The Trump administration is in danger of losing control of the political storm unleashed by its killing of Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani.

President Trump's claim that the drone strike last week made Americans safer is being challenged by cascading events that appear to leave the US more vulnerable and isolated.

Criticism in the US: The administration's basis for the attack came under suspicion after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN that it was not ""relevant"" to reveal how imminent the attacks on US interests were that Trump said Soleimani was planning.

Dissent also emerged inside the administration over Trump's vow to strike Iranian cultural sites if Tehran mounts a reprisal strike.

Anger in the Middle East: In signs of the deepening crisis, Iran on Sunday announced that it was shaking off restrictions on its uranium enrichment under the Obama-era nuclear deal.

Iraq's Parliament also voted to expel US troops -- which could imperil the fight against extremism and consolidate Iranian influence in Baghdad.

An isolated US: Washington's European allies have distanced themselves from Trump's assault. The US-led military coalition fighting ISIS temporarily stopped its counter-ISIS missions in order to focus on protecting Iraqi bases and coalition forces there from Iranian-backed militias. And in a sign of widening gaps between Iraq and the US, Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said he had been scheduled to meet Soleimani on the day he was killed.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Saturday the United States committed a ""grave mistake"" in killing Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and US President Donald Trump responded on Twitter, writing that if Tehran attacks American assets, the US will strike ""very hard and very fast.""

The US has a list of 52 Iranian targets , Trump tweeted. The number was chosen to match the number of hostages taken in the 1979 takeover of the US Embassy, he said.

Rouhani said earlier Americans would face consequences for killing Soleimani ""not only today, but also in the coming years.""

Rouhani's remarks came on the same day mourners in neighboring Iraq had chanted ""Death to America"" at a funeral procession for Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader who died with him in a US airstrike in Iraq early Friday.

""The Americans did not understand what grave mistake they committed,"" Rouhani said while visiting the house of Soleimani's family in Tehran, according to a statement his office released.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif seemed to suggest a goal of any Iranian retaliation, tweeting Saturday : ""End of US malign presence in West Asia has begun.""

In a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Rouhani said Iran's neighbors in the region should work in unison against the US presence there or the whole area will be in jeopardy, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported.

Major escalation

The strike killed Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport, along with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces. At least six people were killed in the strike, an Iraqi security source told CNN on condition of anonymity.

Maj. Gen. Ismail Qaani, who served for years alongside Soleimani, has been appointed his replacement.

It marks a major escalation in regional tensions that have pitted Tehran against Washington and its allies in the Middle East.

Trump said Soleimani was plotting ""imminent and sinister attacks"" on Americans.

The Pentagon blamed Soleimani and Iran-backed Iraqi militias for recent assaults on coalition bases in Iraq, including a December 27 strike that killed an American civilian contractor and wounded several US and Iraqi military personnel.

After retaliatory US airstrikes against the militias last month, hundreds of protesters stormed the US Embassy compound in Baghdad on December 31, an attack the US blamed on Soleimani.

Soleimani was the head of Quds Force, an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps unit in charge of foreign operations, and he became the architect of Tehran's proxy conflicts in the Middle East. The Pentagon blamed Soleimani for hundreds of deaths of Americans and their allies over the years.

Iran says it will fight back

Rockets hit parts of Baghdad on Saturday, including the parade grounds in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone and the Al-Jadriya area just south of the Green Zone, injuring no one, the Iraqi army said. The Green Zone contains Parliament, ministries and foreign embassies.

Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, left, and Qasem Soleimani were killed in the US strike.

Rockets targeted Balad Air Base, which houses US and Iraqi forces and contractors, the Iraqi army said. No injuries were reported.

Separately, an Iraqi civilian contractor there told CNN that four rockets landed outside the base's southern gate.

It wasn't immediately clear who fired the rockets. It's not uncommon for rockets to be fired at US positions in Iraq.

During Rouhani's visit with Soleimani's family Saturday, Soleimani's daughter asked him: ""Who will take revenge for my father?""

""Everyone will take revenge,"" he replied, in video aired by Iranian state television.

In a letter to the United Nations, Iran described the attack as state terrorism and an unlawful criminal act. European officials and the UN have called for de-escalation.

It was ""tantamount to opening a war,"" Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Friday. He said the strike had escalated a war that started when the US pulled out of a nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

Some Democratic lawmakers have said they weren't yet convinced the strike was merited . Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said Friday one of his representatives attended a classified briefing, and ""nothing that came out of the briefing changed my view that this was an unnecessary escalation of the situation in Iraq and Iran.""

He said the strike will increase threats to US interests.

JUST WATCHED Who are the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who are the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps? 02:09

""Today the administration announced we're sending 3,000 more troops to the region,"" he said. ""So, clearly the administration recognizes that this action has actually dramatically increased the risks in the Middle East, increased the risks of an attack from Iran.""

The Trump administration has warned members of Congress that Iran is expected to retaliate against the US within weeks for the strike. Authorities in the United States are increasing vigilance and fortifying defenses

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf issued a new National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin. ""Iran maintains a robust cyber program and can execute cyberattacks against the United States,"" according to the bulletin, which expires January 18.

Wolf maintained in a statement that there is ""no specific, credible threat against the homeland.""

Mourners chant 'Death to America' at funeral procession

In Iraq's capital on Saturday, thousands of people attended a funeral procession, mourning Soleimani and al-Muhandis as they chanted ""Death to America.""

Mourners surround a car carrying Qasem Soleimani's coffin on Saturday in Baghdad.

Mourners wept as they walked alongside the vehicle carrying his coffin down the streets of Baghdad. Some carried signs that read, ""We are all Muhandis and Soleimani.""

Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi was among the crowd of mourners walking next to the cars carrying the coffins.

Some women carrying flags of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces erupted into tears when the slain commanders were mentioned. Many mourners said the attack strengthened their resolve to expel US forces from Iraq.

""This strike killed our heroes, but it created a thousand more Hajji Soleimanis and Muhandises,"" said Assifa Abbas, 50, a mother of three PMF fighters. ""If Parliament doesn't vote to expel US troops, they will see the true face of the Iraqi street.""

Abbas walked in the procession with an image of al-Muhandis and Soleimani taped on her black chador. She said she would refuse to allow her sons back into her house until they pushed the ""last American"" from Iraq.

Former Parliament member Fawzi Akram, from Iraq's Turkmen ethnic minority, predicted the attack would end US dominance in the country. ""The map of a new Iraq will be drawn with the blood of these martyrs,"" Akram said.

Mourners wave flags Saturday in Baghdad.

Mourner Mohammad al-Fadli said the killings came as an ""indescribable shock."" ""These are the people who got rid of ISIS for us,"" al-Fadli said.

The PMF -- Shia militia first mobilized in 2013 to confront the advance of ISIS -- were key ground forces in the early days of an offensive to push ISIS out Iraq, eventually recapturing several towns from the extremist group. Soleimani was reported to be on the ground directing battles against ISIS in Iraq, as well as Syria.

Iraq's anti-corruption demonstrators also aren't happy about the US strike

In another part of Baghdad, some anti-government demonstrators have been demanding, among other things, an end to heavy-handed Iranian influence in Iraq. But many haven't been happy about the US strike.

Since the anti-corruption protests began in October, Iraqi security forces have tried to violently quash them, killing hundreds of demonstrators and wounding many more.

Still, people at Baghdad's main protest site, Tahrir Square, said Saturday that the US should not have conducted an attack on their soil.

""We are the people of Iraq. We don't want outsiders to rule us,"" protester Muthana Salman said.",Trump and Rouhani trade warnings after killing of top general,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/04/middleeast/qasem-soleimani-airstrike-saturday/index.html,2020-01-04T00:00:00
"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (CNN) Iran may well have calculated that it's better off with a Democrat in the White House and not a Republican like President Donald Trump .

Logically -- and Iran's leaders are intensely pragmatic in that far-sighted way -- Tehran will likely calibrate its vowed ""harsh revenge"" response to the killing of Qasem Soleimani in a bid to cost Trump re-election.

Part of that calculation is likely to have Iran focus on targets inside the United States as well as in the Middle East, not just to embarrass Trump but to limit regional escalation.

Hours after the strike Trump said his intention was ""to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war."" But the President's actions may soon catch up with his words at home -- especially when fighting an election campaign.

And the President should be aware that while Iran may well start to settle the score quickly, it is also a master of serving revenge up cold.

During a bout of Middle East tension in 1988, the USS Vincennes on patrol in the Persian Gulf accidentally shot down an Iranian civilian passenger jet, killing all 290 people on board.

Tehran's leaders waited nine months for revenge, widely suspected of having a pipe bomb detonated under the Vincennes captain's car, narrowly missing maiming his wife.

The advantage of attacking inside the US limits the likelihood of its regional neighbors escalating hostilities, and that's important for two reasons. One, Iran is likely to lose in a regional conflict and, two, the optics are better; revenge is directly aimed at the culprit of the attack, limiting tempers flaring in the region.

For sure the world has moved on a lot since 1988, and post-9/11 the US is far more attuned to catching international terrorists on its soil, but the idea for Iran will likely remain the same. Pick a soft and symbolic target that might embarrass the US President; a cyber-attack can now cause as much disruption as a pipe bomb, for example.

Key players with much to lose

Other stakeholders with sway in Tehran, like Russia and China, who last week held joint naval exercises in the Persian Gulf may also be ready to tolerate an Iranian response that helps remove Trump from the White House in 2020.

Russian President Vladimir Putin might value Trump for his naivety and inexperience, but not his unpredictability, particularly where Russian interests can be negatively impacted like the Middle East. A big regional war would be inevitably costly for Russia; they simply couldn't walk away from the blood and toil they've spent in Syria. The calculation for Moscow would be, why risk war as a result of an unpredictable Trump in office if you can maintain and grow regional influence without undue economic pain?

China also is familiar with the economic pain and uncertainty inflicted by Trump: China and Russia -- both core allies of Iran -- both have much to lose if Tehran's revenge backfires, and potentially much to gain if the theocratic leadership can unseat Trump.

Over the past few months Trump has oscillated from planning to pull forces from the region, to sending thousands more in. But this swing between, on the one hand, disengagement and, on the other, potentially triggering a war is an unsustainable uncertainty for both China and Russia. At a minimum they may well be ambivalent to Trump's exit from the White House and not stand in Iran's way.

Russia in particular has much to gain from letting Iran take revenge as it sees fit. Putin is friends of the leaders in both Tehran and Riyadh. In any regional escalation Moscow could emerge as mediators, or at the very least have scope to exploit its role as middleman to America's disadvantage.

Although Trump is unlikely to lose many votes over such subtle shifts of global power, it will still be grist to the mill for Democrats grinding down narrow margins next fall. So too will voter perceptions of what is happening in the Middle East be in play even if war is avoided, as still seems most likely thus far.

To that point, the killing of Soleimani may still be playing out. He was vital in bringing Russia into Syria, making trips to Moscow in 2015 and 2017. He was also vital in handling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as well as an extensive network of Shia militias in Syria, and proxies elsewhere in the region. If his replacement hasn't nailed those powerful relationships, all bets for stability could still be off.

The situation is fragile and the chance of it backfiring on US long term interests is significant.

Strategically, Trump seems disadvantaged, with an election on his plate and an enemy poised, waiting with a cold course of revenge on hand.",Trump vulnerable to Iranian revenge in US election year,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/04/middleeast/trump-iran-revenge-analysis-intl/index.html,2020-01-04T00:00:00
"(CNN) A coalition spokesman denied that a convoy that included Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces was hit by an airstrike in Iraq on Saturday morning.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) US President Donald Trump has said that he ordered a precision strike to ""terminate"" a top Iranian commander who was plotting ""imminent and sinister attacks"" on Americans, adding that the decision was one of deterrence rather than aggression.

""We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,"" Trump said in a statement from his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday, a day after a US drone strike on a Baghdad airport killed Qasem Soleimani.

Later, while at a Miami church for an Evangelicals for Trump event, the President said: ""He was planning a very major attack and we got him.""

Iran, in a letter to the United Nations, called the attack state terrorism and an unlawful criminal act.

Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett Out Front"" that the attack was ""tantamount to opening a war."" There will be revenge, he said.

""The response for a military action is a military action. By whom? When? Where? That is for the future to witness,"" he said.

He said Washington has escalated a war it began when it pulled out of a nuclear deal with Tehran.

""The US has started the economic war in -- in May 2018. Last night, they started a military war. By assassinating, by an act of terror, against one of our top generals,"" he told CNN.

The move marks a major escalation in regional tensions that have pitted Tehran against Washington and its allies in the Middle East, raising the specter of further regional destabilization. The strike, condemned by Iran and its allies as an ""assassination,"" has been met with concern by European officials and the United Nations, who have called for de-escalation.

The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed the strike killed Soleimani , who as head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force became the architect of Tehran's proxy conflicts in the Middle East.

Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis -- the deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) -- was also killed, according to a statement from the PMF, which said the pair ""were martyred by an American strike.""

Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, left, and Qasem Soleimani were killed in the US strike.

Early Saturday, the group said another airstrike that targeted a convoy in the Taji area north of Baghdad killed and wounded a number of PMF members.

The initial report indicates a medical units convoy was hit near Taji Stadium in Baghdad, the PMF said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Trump administration viewed Soleimani as a ruthless killer, and the President told reporters Friday that the general should have been taken out by previous presidents.

The Pentagon blamed Soleimani for hundreds of deaths of Americans and their allies in several attacks in recent months.

""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,"" the Pentagon said in a statement Thursday, calling the strike ""decisive defensive"" action aimed at deterring future Iranian attacks.

The Pentagon blamed Soleimani and his Quds Force for attacks on coalition bases in Iraq in recent months, including the December 27 strike that culminated in the deaths of an American contractor and Iraqi personnel. He was also blamed for the December 31 US Embassy attack in Baghdad , and in addition to the hundreds killed in his time as a commander, thousands more were wounded, the Pentagon said.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the State Department's special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said the strike was aimed at deterring impending attacks.

This vehicle was hit in the US airstrike Friday.

Pompeo told CNN that the strike had thwarted an ""imminent"" attack in the region, but declined to give any details on the intelligence on which he based his statement. Hook, who told Al Arabiya that he had seen ""all of the intelligence"" on the action, suggested that ""American personnel and facilities in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and beyond"" were the planned targets.

At least six people were killed in the strike, an Iraqi security source told CNN on condition of anonymity.

After initial reports emerged, Trump shared a cryptic tweet that consisted only of an image of the US flag. Later, Trump tweeted that Soleimani ""should have been taken out many years ago.""

Trump remains open to talks without preconditions with Iran, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said.

The President has offered to talk ""at any time"" with Iran, but ""those efforts have been rebuffed,"" O'Brien told reporters on a briefing call.

O'Brien said Soleimani was in Damascus, Syria, before he traveled to Baghdad.

Iran vows revenge, Middle East on alert

Iran will hold three days of national mourning. Funeral processions will be held for Soleimani in both Iran and Iraq, Iranian state-run IRNA news agency reported.

Thousands of demonstrators were seen marching in Tehran and other cities to protest the strike after Friday prayers, news agency video footage shows.

Men, women and children carried images of the slain commander, many crying and others shaking their fists, shouting ""Death to America"" and ""Revenge, revenge, revenge."" Protesters also ripped up a US flag and burned an Israeli one.

Protesters mourn the death of Qasem Soleimani Friday in the Iranian capital, Tehran.

The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed ""harsh revenge,"" according to a statement published to his official website.

""His pure blood was shed in the hands of the most depraved of human beings,"" Khamenei said, adding that it had been Soleimani's wish to become a martyr.

Khamenei has appointed Maj. Gen. Ismail Qaani as Soleimani's replacement, according to a statement from his office published by IRNA. Qaani had served for years alongside Soleimani, he said.

Some US officials are bracing for Iran to retaliate with a cyber attack, but Iran has shown it's also capable of engaging in another form of online warfare: social media disinformation campaigns

Authorities in the United States on Friday were increasing vigilance and fortifying defenses

Protesters in Tehran demonstrate Friday against the airstrike in Iraq.

Iraq's anti-government protesters, who have been staging a demonstration for months in Baghdad's Tahrir Square, condemned America for violating Iraq's sovereignty and ""committing assassinations of Iraqi figures."" One of their key demands is an end to heavy-handed Iranian influence in Iraq, but they made clear that that did not equate to support of US actions.

Muqtada al-Sadr, who leads the largest political bloc in Iraq's Parliament, has ordered the revival of the Mehdi Army, which fought US troops during the 2003 invasion, he said in a statement. He also called on Iraqis to exercise ""wisdom and shrewdness.""

One pro-Iranian Iraqi cleric, Qais al-Khazali, called for the removal of US forces from Iraq and for the ""demise"" of Israel, as a response to the deaths of Soleimani and al-Muhandis.

Khamenei pays a visit to Soleimani's family.

There are concerns, too, that the killing on Iraqi soil could have a destabilizing effect on that country and create space for a new proxy war, according to Feisal Istrabadi, the founding director of the Indiana University Center for the Study of the Middle East told CNN.

""This is a huge deal throughout the Middle East. The fact that it was done over the territory of Iraq means that Iraq will become what I feared it would become from the beginning: the battleground between Iran and the United States.""

Hassan Nasrallah, head of the Iran-backed Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah, has also vowed to avenge the killings, while Israel is assessing its security following the attacks, including at its diplomatic missions around the world.

US ally Saudi Arabia has called for restraint in the wake of the strike, which it said came as a result of ""terrorist acts"" that the kingdom had previously denounced.

The US State Department is urging its citizens to leave Iraq immediately. US embassies in Bahrain, Kuwait and Pakistan have issued security alerts to US government employees and citizens.

The force protection level for all US military in the Central Command area of operations has been increased in the last 24 hours, two US defense officials said Friday morning, and the US plans to deploy thousands of additional troops to the Middle East as tensions with Iran mount.

Biden says US strike 'dynamite in a tinderbox'

In the US, the news of Soleimani's killing generated starkly different reactions along party lines, with Republicans heaping praise on Trump and Democrats expressing concerns about the timing, legality and consequences of the strike

Former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, warned that the US strike could trigger a conflict across the Middle East.

""President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, and he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel, our people and our interests, both here at home and abroad, and our partners throughout the region and beyond,"" Biden tweeted.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, emphasized that Soleimani ""was an enemy of the United States"" in a tweet, but asked: ""The question is this -- as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?""

Some key members of Congress -- such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is a member of the congressional Gang of Eight leaders, who are briefed on classified matters -- had not been made aware of the attack ahead of time. It's unclear how many other lawmakers had advance notice of the strike.

Schumer said on the Senate floor Friday that the President ""does not have the authority for a war with Iran"" and that Trump would need congressional approval for a large increase in troops and ""and potential hostility over a longer time.""

Republicans reacted with almost uniform praise for Trump.

""I appreciate President @realDonaldTrump's bold action against Iranian aggression,"" GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a fierce Trump ally, wrote in a tweet Thursday. ""To the Iranian government: if you want more, you will get more.""

Sen. Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a news release that ""General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans"" and ""the President made the brave and right call, and Americans should be proud of our service members who got the job done.""",US drone strike ordered by Trump kills top Iranian commander in Baghdad,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/02/middleeast/baghdad-airport-rockets/index.html,2020-01-02T00:00:00
"(CNN) The killing of Qasem Soleimani , one of the most powerful men in Iran, is a dramatic escalation of an already dangerous situation in the Middle East, threatening to trigger violence from the Gulf to the shores of the Mediterranean.

The Pentagon announced the US had carried out the attack near Baghdad airport, describing it as ""decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad.""

In a statement late Thursday, the Pentagon asserted that ""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region."" It said Soleimani ""had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months.""

The targeted US drone strike also killed one of the most prominent leaders of the Iraqi Shia militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Al-Muhandis was the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group that Washington blames for a recent surge in rocket attacks against US forces in Iraq.

Hundreds of the group's supporters attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad this week following US airstrikes against five of Kataib Hezbollah's units in Iraq and Syria last Friday.

The latest crisis has been brewing for weeks amid an uptick in rocket attacks by Shia militia against Iraqi bases where US forces are present -- attacks of growing sophistication and accuracy -- in which a US civilian contractor has been killed.

But Charles Lister, a leading analyst of Iranian policy in the region, says this strike far eclipses the deaths of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in terms of strategic significance and implications. ""The US and Iran have been engaged in a dangerous tit-for-tat for months now, but this is a massive walk-up the escalation ladder,"" he said.

The US drone strike killed the commander of Iran's Quds Force at Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2019.

Ben Friedman, policy director of think tank Defense Priorities in Washington, told CNN that the strike was a ""remarkably reckless act, because the forces the US has in the region are not sufficient to deal with the potential fallout.""

Soleimani was once described by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as a ""living martyr of the revolution."" Friedman describes his killing as an act of war that the Iranians will feel compelled to avenge.

Soleimani was the architect of the growing Iranian military presence in Iraq, Syria and Yemen as the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force, essentially Iran's special forces tasked with missions beyond Iranian borders.

He had led the Quds force for nearly 20 years, ""working as a power broker and as a military force: assassinating rivals, arming allies, and, for most of a decade, directing a network of militant groups that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq,"" as Dexter Filkins wrote in a New Yorker profile in 2013. He was revered by his fighters, whose funerals he often attended.

Ali Soufan, a former FBI officer with extensive experience in the Middle East, wrote in the Combating Terrorism Center's Sentinel in 2018 that ""without question, Soleimani is the most powerful general in the Middle East today; he is also one of Iran's most popular living people.""

""More than anyone else, Soleimani has been responsible for the creation of an arc of influence -- which Iran terms its 'Axis of Resistance' -- extending from the Gulf of Oman through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea,"" wrote Soufan, who now runs the Soufan Group, which analyzes events in the Middle East.

In early 2008, Soleimani sent General David Petraeus, then the most senior US commander in Iraq, an imperious message: ""Dear General Petraeus: You should be aware that I, Qassem Soleimani, control Iran's policy for Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Afghanistan. And indeed, the ambassador in Baghdad is a Quds Force member. The individual who's going to replace him is a Quds Force member.""

Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), left, and Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force unit, right, were killed in the US strike.

Soleimani was hugely influential among what are known as the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq -- Shia militia first mobilized in 2013 to confront the advance of ISIS. He personally led their campaign to drive ISIS out of cities like Tikrit. Those militia remain a powerful force in Iraq, many of them outside the control of a weak state.

Soleimani was also the chief Iranian official in providing support for the Assad regime in Syria, for which he was sanctioned by the US Treasury. Along with Russian airpower, his leadership of Shia militia from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon helped turn the tide of the war in Syria as Assad's army weakened in 2015-16.

And Soleimani was an important Iranian interlocutor with the powerful Hezbollah militia in Lebanon. In a recent interview, Soleimani revealed that he had taken part in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, saying he was present in Lebanon throughout the conflict.

Targets for retaliation

This strike then is nothing like those aimed at terrorist leaders like Baghdadi and bin Laden. US Democratic Senator Chris Murphy asked: ""Did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?""

The assassination of such a powerful official will certainly not go unanswered by Tehran, which has responded to the imposition of crippling US sanctions over the last 18 months with what it calls a policy of maximum resistance. Khamenei himself said Friday that ""harsh revenge awaits the criminals"" involved in the killing of Soleimani and others, in a message to the nation published on his official website.

Iran's campaign has included the harassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf and Arabian Sea -- and attacks on Saudi Arabia, including devastating cruise missile strikes against the kingdom's largest oil processing plant at Abqaiq in September that took out 5.7 million barrels of oil production at a stroke.

Protesters demonstrate in Tehran on Friday after the killing of Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force unit.

Besides its own forces in the IRGC, Iran has powerful proxies across the region -- in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. All will likely be tasked with finding ways of attacking US interests and allies. In the face of adversaries with superior military capabilities, Iran has mastered the art of asymmetrical warfare, a sort of state-sponsored guerrilla action, and exported the model to its allies across the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javid Zarif described the US action as ""extremely dangerous & a foolish escalation. The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.""

What those consequences will be is yet unknown. One possible target for retaliation will be the small US military presence in Syria, which in some places is within miles of units of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units. Charles Lister believes ""the US presence in Syria now looks very vulnerable, having already shrunk in size and weakened in terms of credibility and partner trust.""

""US allies in the Gulf, particularly Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi, could all fall victim to Iranian retaliatory measures, as could [the US] al-Udeid base in Qatar,"" adds Lister.

Friedman says he doesn't think Iran ""will start a war with the United States, but you can imagine there will be a number of provocative acts against US forces."" And he agrees the 500-strong US contingent in Syria might be especially vulnerable.

For the Iraqi government, already reeling in the face of popular protests against corruption that have left nearly 500 people dead over the past three months, this strike threatens to plunge the country into a new spasm of political violence.

Since the Trump administration began its policy of ""maximum pressure"" against Iran, the Iraqis have tried to navigate a path to neutrality between two titans. They have largely failed -- and Iraq could now become the sandbox for a US-Iranian conflict, just as it faces the re-emergence of the remnants of ISIS in provinces north of Baghdad.

Iraqi authorities responded to the US strike by putting the Green Zone in Baghdad, where the US and other embassies are situated, on lockdown. But there is no underestimating the anger of a broad swathe of Iraqis against such a flagrant violation of the country's sovereignty.

Lister says Soleimani's death ""is a serious loss for Iran's regional agenda, but his 'martyrdom' will likely fuel a response that will, at least in the medium term, make up for his death. With Soleimani dead, war is coming -- that seems certain, the only questions are where, in what form and when?""

This has been corrected.",US drone strike against top Iranian commander threatens spiral of violence in Middle East,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/03/middleeast/baghdad-soleimani-lister-analysis-intl/index.html,2020-01-03T00:00:00
"(CNN) The US drone strike on Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force unit, may have been a ""target of opportunity"" but it clearly had presidential authorization for longer than just last night. The US wants to send the signal that this is deliberate. But it is escalatory and brings the region to a new brink of chaos.

So how could the US authorities possibly calculate this was a good idea?

Well, Iran has been attacking the US and its allies via proxies for months. They are accused of hitting Saudi oilfields . A US drone before that. Oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. And this week they directed attacks at the US Embassy in Baghdad , the US says.

The US is already being attacked by pro-Iranian forces, its officials could argue, so the US logic might be that any response from Iran will be a worsening of the same asymmetrical paper cuts already being inflicted.

It is true that Iran does not have the military might to tackle the US in an open conventional war. US officials may argue that they needed to send a strong signal that this White House was not gun-shy and would fight violence with violence, regardless of any denials from Tehran.

"(CNN) Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a US airstrike ordered by President Donald Trump at Baghdad International Airport on Friday, was hailed as a hero in Iran -- brave, charismatic and beloved by the troops.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, once called him a ""living martyr of the revolution."" But the United States viewed Iran's top general as a ruthless killer.

One of Iran's most powerful men, Soleimani cut a highly controversial figure. He was head of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, an elite unit that handles Iran's overseas operations -- and one deemed to be a foreign terrorist organization by the US.

Having started his front line military career in the Iran-Iraq war during the early 1980s, Soleimani rose to prominence to become an indispensable figure in Iran, playing an instrumental role in spreading its influence in the Middle East.

"(CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested immunity from prosecution in three corruption cases in which he faces indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.

Netanyahu submitted the request to the Knesset late Wednesday night, saying he plans on leading the country ""for many years to come.""

""What is being done to me is a field court-martial by misleading the public,"" Netanyahu said in a televised statement Wednesday evening in Jerusalem. ""The immunity law is intended to protect elected officials from fabricated legal proceedings -- from political indictment intended to damage the will of the people. This law intends to ensure that those elected can serve the people according to the will of the people, not the will of the law clerks.""

Charges against Netanyahu were unveiled in November. He's maintained his innocence throughout the ongoing criminal proceedings, calling them an ""attempted coup"" led by the left and the media.

Political rival slams request

Rival Benny Gantz, who leads the Blue and White party, blasted Netanyahu's request, saying voters will have two choices in the upcoming elections in March.

"" ... the interests of Netanyahu will win or the national interest will win. Or there will be an extreme immunity government or there will be broad unity government. Or the kingdom of Netanyahu or the State of Israel,"" said Gantz shortly after Netanyahu spoke.

""Blue and White led by me will do everything according to the law.""

Members of Knesset, including the Prime Minister, are entitled by law to request parliamentary immunity from prosecution. The request is considered by the Knesset's House Committee. If the request is approved in the committee, it is then passed on to a vote in the full 120-member Knesset.

But the House Committee hasn't been formed since Israel's election in April began a period of prolonged political deadlock. Elections in September failed to break that deadlock, and once again, no House Committee was formed. Without a seated committee, there is no way to consider Netanyahu's request for immunity, putting any criminal proceedings against the Prime Minister on hold at least until the upcoming elections on March 2.

Members of the opposition have said they would seek to form a temporary House Committee to consider the immunity request, but it's unclear at this stage if such a move is likely to happen.

If granted, the immunity from prosecution applies only to the current Knesset, meaning Netanyahu would have to request immunity again following any subsequent election.

Moments after Netanyahu finished his statement, former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said his Yisrael Beiteinu would vote unanimously against immunity. ""It's now clear beyond any doubt. All that Netanyahu is interested in is immunity,"" said Liberman in a statement.

""This is what he wakes up with in the morning, this is what he lives, this is what he breathes throughout the day, this is what he goes to bed with. The State of Israel has become a hostage of a private personal problem of Netanyahu.""

Four reasons for seeking immunity

If the immunity request is rejected, Netanyahu does not have to resign immediately. Under Israeli law, he can remain Prime Minister while the trial is ongoing. He only has to resign if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process, a process which could take years.

Under Israeli law, Knesset members can request immunity citing one of four reasons:

Protection of freedom of expression

Prosecutors were acting in bad faith or discriminating against the member

The Knesset has already disciplined the member and there is no public interest in a trial

Criminal proceedings would cause serious damage to the functioning of the Knesset, its committees, or the will of the voters. In addition, there would not be considerable damage to the public interest without a trial.

Since the immunity law was updated in 2005, no member of Knesset has been granted immunity from prosecution. (There is one open request for former Minister of Welfare Haim Katz, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, who faces indictment on charges of fraud and breach of trust.) Prior to 2005, parliamentary immunity was automatically granted to members of Knesset -- the law was changed to force them to submit a formal request, which would then be weighed by the Knesset House Committee.

In recent weeks, Netanyahu had begun floating the idea of seeking immunity at campaign rallies, warming his voter base to the possibility. On Sunday, at an event in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said, ""Immunity is not against democracy. Immunity is a cornerstone of democracy."" The crowd erupted into cheers, with some shouting, ""Take the immunity!""

Lengthy investigation

Since the investigations were announced three years ago, Netanyahu has waged a campaign of delegitimization against them, denouncing them as a media-driven witch hunt. As the investigations advanced, Netanyahu sharpened his rhetoric and expanded his attacks, saying, ""Every day, my blood, my wife's blood, my children's blood is being shed by those with evil intent."" Calling the investigations ""contaminated"" and demanding that ""the investigators are investigated,"" Netanyahu began attacking the judicial system, the police, and the state prosecutor's office.

""There is one law for others, and one law for Netanyahu,"" he claimed in November when the indictments were unveiled.

As speculation grew earlier this week that Netanyahu would request immunity, Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List, tweeted Saturday, ""I call on the entire public to seek immunity against the flu, not against an indictment of bribery.""

The decision to allow the formation of a Knesset House Committee now passes to Speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party. If Edelstein decides not to allow the committee to form, the legal proceedings against Netanyahu could remain stuck until after the March elections. Israel's legal deadlock would match its political deadlock.",Israel's Netanyahu seeks immunity from prosecution in corruption cases,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/01/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-immunity-request/index.html,2020-01-01T00:00:00

وتجمع آلاف الإيرانيين في جامعة طهران للمشاركة في صلاة الجنازة على جثمان سليماني، وفقًا لما نقلته وسائل إعلام إيرانية، واحتشد المشيعون في وقت مبكر من صباح الاثنين في جامعة طهران ومحيطها، حاملين صور قائد فيلق القدس قاسم سليماني.

وردد الآلاف المشاركين في صلاة الجنازة، هتافات ""الموت لأمريكا"" و""الموت لإسرائيل""، حاملين لافتات تطالب بالانتقام لمقتل سليماني.

"واشنطن، الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية (CNN)-- أعلنت رئيسة مجلس النواب في الولايات المتحدة نانسي بيلوسي، أن الكونغرس سيصوت هذا الأسبوع، على مشروع قرار يهدف إلى الحد من صلاحيات الرئيس الأمريكي دونالد ترامب العسكرية تجاه إيران.

وأوضحت بيلوسي، في بيان، في وقت متأخر من مساء الأحد، أن مجلس النواب سيقدم ويصوت على مشروع قرار للحد من صلاحيات الرئيس الأمريكي ترامب العسكرية فيما يتعلق بإيران، مشيرة إلى أن هذا المشروع يشابه للمشروع الذي قدمه السيناتور تيم كين في مجلس الشيوخ.

وأضافت بيلوسي، أن هذا القرار ""يؤكد من جديد مسؤوليات الكونغرس الإشرافية الراسخة، من خلال تكليفه بأنه إذا لم يتم اتخاذ أي إجراء إضافي من جانب الكونغرس، فإن الأعمال العسكرية التي تقوم بها الإدارة فيما يتعلق بإيران تتوقف في غضون 30 يومًا"".

وقالت بيلوسي في رسالتها إلى نواب الحزب الديمقراطي في الكونغرس، إن ""إدارة ترامب نفذت في الأسبوع الماضي غارة جوية استفزازية وغير متناسبة، استهدفت مسؤولين عسكريين إيرانيين رفيعي المستوى""، مضيفة أن هذه الغارة عرضت جنودنا والدبلوماسيين وغيرهم للخطر بتهديد تصعيد خطير للتوترات مع إيران"".

واعتبرت رئيسة مجلس النواب في الكونغرس الأمريكي، أن مسؤولية أعضاء الكونغرس ""هي الحفاظ على سلامة الشعب الأمريكي. لهذا السبب، نشعر بالقلق من أن الإدارة قد اتخذت هذا الإجراء دون استشارة الكونغرس ودون احترام سلطات الحرب في الكونغرس الممنوحة لها بموجب الدستور.

وأوضح ترامب للصحفيين، ""يُسمح لهم بقتل شعبنا، ويُسمح لهم بتعذيب وتشويه شعبنا، ويُسمح لهم باستخدام القنابل التي تزرع على الطريق وتفجير شعبنا، ولا يُسمح لنا بلمس موقعهم الثقافي؟""، مضيفًا ""الأمور لا تسري بهذا الطريقة"".

وفي سؤال عن احتمالات انتقام إيران على خلفية الضربة الأمريكية التي أودت سليماني، قال ترامب ""إذا حدث ذلك، سيكون هناك انتقام كبير"".

وهدد الرئيس الأمريكي ترامب، بفرض عقوبات على العراق في حالة طرد القوات الأمريكية من البلاد.

وقال ترامب، على متن الطائرة الرئاسية، مساء الأحد، ""إذا طلبوا منا المغادرة، إذا لم نفعل ذلك بطريقة ودية للغاية، سوف نفرض عليهم عقوبات، لم يسبق لها مثيل من قبل""، مضيفًا ""ستجعل العقوبات الإيرانية تبدو هينة بعض الشيء"".

وتابع ترامب، في تصريحاته للصحفيين على متن الطائرة الرئاسية، أن تكاليف الحفاظ على وجود القوات الأمريكية في البلاد على مدى السنوات العديدة الماضية يجب أن يسددها العراق إذا اختارت البلاد إلغاء الاتفاقية التي تسمح لهم بالبقاء.

وأضاف ترامب ""لدينا قاعدة جوية باهظة التكلفة للغاية. لقد كلف بنائها مليارات الدولارات، قبل وقت طويل من وصولي للرئاسة"".

أبوظبي من السماء.. تقدم لك جولة الطائرة هذه مشاهد لم ترها من قبل للمعا

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- أسفل السماء الزرقاء، تتلألأ ناطحة السحاب ""كابيتال غيت"" بجدرانها الزجاجية. وفي الأعلى، يتدلى منظفو النوافذ ويقومون بتلميع الألواح الزجاجية التي صممت بشكل خاص لتناسب الشكل غير الاعتيادي لهذا البرج.

وعند مناقشة المشروع مع المهندسين والمعماريين، لم يتمحور الموجز حول إنشاء أكبر أو أطول مبنى في العالم، بل ""تحدي قواعد العمارة، وبناء هيكل من شأنه وضع أبوظبي على خريطة العالم""، وفقاً لما قاله المهندس الرئيسي لـمشروع ""كابيتال غيت""، ومدير الهندسة في شركة أبوظبي الوطنية للمعارض، أحمد المنصوري.

وبعد مرور حوالي 10 أعوام، يظل هذا المبنى ""أكثر مبنى مائل من صنع الإنسان في العالم""، وفقاً لموسوعة ""غينيس"" للأرقام القياسية.

ويميل هذا البرج غرباً لـ18 درجة، أي 5 أضعاف زاوية برج بيزا المائل في إيطاليا تقريباً.

وتميل الطوابق الـ17 في الأعلى على الحافة، ما يضع آلاف الأطنان من الضغط على مركز المبنى، وفقاً لشرح المنصوري، مضيفاً أن ""الطبيعة تريده أن ينهار. كل شيء يتعلق بالبرج يرغب منه أن يسقط، ولكن تم تصميمه للوقوف"".

الأول من نوعه في العالم

برج ""كابيتال جيت"" (Capital Gate) بالعاصمة الإماراتية أبوظبي.

ويتم مواجهة ضغط الجاذبية الناجم عن ميلانه لـ18 درجة من قبل أول محور مركزي منحني في العالم، وهو يتكون من 15 ألف متر مكعب من الخرسانة المعززة بـ10 ألف طن من الفولاذ.

وأضاف المنصوري أنهم أنشأوا قسمين من الركائز، مع كون إحداهما أعمق من الآخرى، ومعاً، هما ""يكونان قوى متنافسة تُبقي المبنى في وضع مستقيم"".

ويتكون المبنى من 15 طابقاً من المكاتب، و4 مطاعم وحانات، وفندق ""Andaz Capital Gate"".

وفي حديثها عن الفندق، قالت موظفة تُدعى جوليا غيماديفا: ""بسبب شكل المبنى، إن كل غرفة فندقية تكون مختلفة"".

ويطل مطعم ""18 درجة"" في الفندق على مركز أبوظبي الوطني للمعارض. ومن الأمام، لن تستطيع الإشاحة بنظرك عن المشهد الخلاب لمياه الخليج، وجزر أبوظبي.

ومن الجدير بالذكر أن تصميم البرج كان من وحي طبيعة أبوظبي، وبالتحديد كثبانها الرملية التي تحركها الرياح، وأمواج الخليج، وفقاً لما قاله المنصوري.

يهتم فندق ""Andaz"" بالفن الإماراتي.

وقال موظف آخر في الفندق، أسد هارون، إن أبوظبي تختلف تماماً مقارنةً بالفترة التي انتقل فيها إلى البلاد في عام 2011.

ومثل 80% من سكان الإمارات، إن هارون هو وافد، وأصله من باكستان.

وأشار هارون إلى أن العديد من مباني هذه المنطقة لم تكن موجودة لدى انتقاله لأبوظبي لأول مرة.

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- في يوم الخميس، أصدرت شركة تحليل بيانات السفر ""Cirium"" تقريرها السنوي بعنوان "" On-Time Performance Review""، وسمّت فيها شركة الطيران الروسية ""ايروفلوت"" بأفضل شركة خطوط جوية رئيسية التزاماً بالمواعيد، بينما سُمي مطار ""شيريميتيفو"" الدولي في موسكو بأكثر مطار التزاماً بالمواعيد في العالم.

وبعد ذلك، أطلقت شركة تحليل البيانات المنافسة ""OAG"" تقريرها الخاص بعنوان ""Punctuality League 2020""، وأعلنت فيها أن شركة الطيران الإندونيسية ""جارودا إندونيسيا"" هي الأكثر التزاماً بالمواعيد في العالم.

وفي المقابل، ذكرت الشركة أيضاً أن ""إيروفلوت"" هي أكثر شركة طيران ضخمة التزاماً بالمواعيد في أوروبا، بينما يُعد ""مطار شيريميتيفو الدولي"" أكثر المطارات الضخمة التزاماً بالمواعيد في العالم.

ولكن ما سبب هذه الاختلافات؟ وما الفرق بين مطار ضخم ومطار صغير؟

أعلنت ""OAG"" أن شركة الطيران الإندونيسية ""جارودا إندونيسيا"" هي الأكثر التزاماً بالمواعيد في العالم.

وقام المحللان بحساب نتائجهما باستخدام مصادر بيانات متشابهة، إذ تقوم ""Cirium"" بتتبع 100 ألف رحلة يومياً، بينما تستند ""OAG"" إلى 57.5 مليون سجل للرحلات الجوية باستخدام بيانات عام كامل من 2019.

ومع ذلك، فهما يختلفان في تصنيفهما.

وكلما زاد حجم المطار، وازداد ازدحام خطوط الطيران، تزيد المسافات والتحديات، ويأخذ المحللان ذلك في عين الاعتبار عند تقييم أداء شركات الطيران والمطارات.

وذكرت ""Cirium"" في تقريرها: ""لا تحصل الخطوط الجوية دائماً على التقدير الذي تستحقه لتقديم مثل هذا المنتج المعقد"".

مطار ""شيريميتيفو"" الدولي في موسكو.

ومن السهل للمطارات التي تحتضن أقل من 5 مليون مقعد مغادر في العام، مثل مطار ""مينسك"" الذي يتصدر لائحة أفضل مطار صغير في العالم في تقرير ""OAG""، ضمان مغادرة 92.6% من رحلاتها في غضون 15دقيقة من الموعد المحدد، بالمقارنة مع مطار ضخم يتعامل مع أكثر من 30 مليون مقعد مغادر.

يمكن أن يُنسب الأداء الممتاز لمطار ""شيريميتيفو""، الذي يتعامل مع أكثر من 300 رحلة في اليوم، بشكل جزئي إلى المدرج الثالث الجديد الذي زاد من سعته.

وعلّق كبير المحللين في ""OAG""، جون غرانت، في بيان صحفي عن كونه عاماً مثيراً للإعجاب فيما يتعلق بالالتزام بالمواعيد، فقال: ""إن السوق العالمي يقترب من الذروة"".

وأضاف غرانت أنه تقود هذا التصاعد خطوط جوية ضخمة مثل ""إيروفلوت""، و""دلتا""، و""إير فرانس"".

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- مع وجود مئات الجزر الكاريبية للإختيار بينها، قد يكون التخطيط لعطلة في هذه المنطقة أمراً صعباً.

ولكن لا تقلق، فإن كل وجهة في هذه البقعة الفيروزية تقدم شيئاً مميزاً. ولذلك، إليك 10 من أفضل الخيارات التي تناسب مختلف الأنشطة التي تخطط للقيام بها في جزر الكاريبي:

دومينيكا لمحبي الجمال الأخضر

دومينيكا.

تغطي القمم الخضراء، والوديان العميقة، ومئات الأنهار جزيرة دومينيكا في شرق البحر الكاريبي.

وتشهد هذه الجزيرة، والتي تبلغ مساحتها 290 ميلا مربعا طفرة في الفنادق الفاخرة، بما في ذلك فندق ""Cabrits Resort & Spa Kempinski"" من فئة 5 نجوم.

كايكوس الشمالية والوسطى لمحبي المناطق غير الملموسة

كايكوس الشمالية والوسطى.

توفر جزر كايكوس الشمالية والوسطى حياة ريفية تخلو من المنتجعات الفارهة. وفي كايكوس الوسطى، ستجد واحدة من أجمل السواحل في شاطئ ""مودجين هاربور"".

وللزوار الذي ينتابهم الفضول تجاه تاريخ الجزيرة، توفر مزرعة ""Wade's Green Plantation"" في كايكوس الشمالية نافذة إلى عصر مزارع الموالين في جزر توركس وكايكوس.

كوراساو للراغبين باستكشاف ""حياة المدن""

كوراساو.

على بعد 90 ميل (145 كيلومترا) شمال فنزويلا، تفتخر جزيرة كوراساو بكونها واحدة من أكثر المراكز الحضرية حيويةً في منطقة البحر الكاريبي.

وتوفر ويلمستاد، وهي عاصمة الجزيرة، تجربة أوروبية-كاريبية فريدة، إذ تجلب العمارة الاستعمارية الهولندية أمستردام إلى هذه الدولة التي تتمتع بحكم ذاتي ضمن المملكة الهولندية.

سابا لمن يرغبون في تجربة تشويق الطيران

سابا.

تُعد هذه الجزيرة، التي تبلغ مساحتها 5 أميال مربعة، بلدية خاصة بهولندا، وهي غير معروفة بشكل كبير بين السياح.

ولا يمكن الوصول لهذه الجزيرة إلا عن طريق الجو من سانت مارتن المجاورة.

وتحتضن جزيرة سابا مدرجاً يبلغ طوله 1300 قدم (396 مترا)، وهو يُصنف غالباً بكونه أقصر مدرج تجاري في العالم.

أنتيغوا لشواطئ متنوعة

أنتيغوا.

تفتخر هذه الجزيرة بـ365 شاطئا، ومن المؤكد أن من شأن هذا العدد الكبير إبقاء محبي الشواطئ مشغولين لفترة طويلة.

ويجذب خليج ديكنسون الباحثين عن أشعة الشمس، والرمال البيضاء، والرياضات المائية.

وأما خليج ""Half Moon""، فهو يوفر العزلة بين رمال كريستالية وردية اللون.

بربادوسة للمأكولات الرائعة ومشروب الروم

بربادوس.

يتحرك قصب السكر في وجه النسيم وسط باربادوس ليذكر الأشخاص بثقافة مشروب الروم الغنية في الجزيرة.

ويمكن للزوار القيام بجولات في مصانع التقطير، أو التوقف عند واحدة من متاجر الروم العديدة في الجزيرة للاستمتاع به مع المحليين.

وإلى جانب ذلك، يمكنك الاستمتاع بأشهى المأكولات من مطبخهم، والذي هو عبارة عن مزيج من النكهات الأفريقية، والهندية، والبريطانية.

سانت بارتس من أجل الفخامة المفرطة

سانت بارتس.

لقد عادت هذه الجزيرة لتقف على قدميها مجدداً بعد إعصار إيرما في عام 2017.

ولن تخيب هذه الجزيرة آمال عشاق الرفاهية، إذ أُعيد افتتاح منتجع ""Eden Rock"" في نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني بعد عامين من التجديد وإعادة البناء.

ويجمع الفندق بين سحر جذوره من الخمسينيات، مع وسائل الراحة الحديثة التي تجذب مشاهير اليوم.

بيميني، البهاما

لهذه الجزيرة صلة تربطها بأيقونة الحقوق المدنية مارتن لوثر كينغ، والكاتب إرنست همنغواي.

وكانت هذه الجزيرة وجهة جاذبة لهمنغواي في الثلاثينيات إذ كان يزورها لصيد السمك.

واستضافت الجزيرة كينغ في الستينيات، وفي إحدى زياراته، عمل كينغ على خطاب قبول جائزة نوبل خاصته قبل وقت قصير من اغتياله في عام 1968.

بورتوريكو للموسيقى والرقص

بورتوريكو.

من الصعب التغلب على هذه الجزيرة عندما يأتي الأمر لمشهد الحياة الليلية، وثقافة الكوكتيل الزاهية.

ويمكنك تعلم رقصة السالسا في ""Cambio en Clave"" في سان خوان، أو زيارة مدرسة ""Don Rafael Cepeda"" لتعلم رقصات مثل ""بومبا""، و""بلينا"".

مارتينيكى للراغبين بنكهة أوروبية في البحر الكاريبي

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- أعلنت إيران، الأحد، أنها لم تعد مُلزمة بآخر قيود ""عملياتية"" في الاتفاق النووي بشأن تخصيب اليورانيوم، وذلك بموجب اتخاذها الخطوة الخامسة والأخيرة في تقليص التزامها بالاتفاق.

وحسب ما أوردته وكالة أنباء فارس شبه الرسمية، أكدت الحكومة الإيرانية، في بيان، أنها لم تعد مُلزمة بأي قيود في المجال العملياتي، التي تشمل مستوى تخصيب اليورانيوم ونسبة التخصيب وحجم المواد المخصبة والأبحاث والتنمية.

وتعني الخطوة الخامسة من تقليص الالتزامات بالاتفاق النووي، تخلي إيران عن آخر مورد أساسي من القيود العملياتية في الاتفاق النووي، أي القيود المرتبطة بعدد أجهزة الطرد المركزي، بحسب وكالة فارس.

وقالت الحكومة الإيرانية إن طهران ""ستمضي قدمًا في برنامجها النووي من الآن فصاعدًا بناءً على احتياجاتها التقنية""، مؤكدة في الوقت ذاته أن التعاون مع الوكالة الدولية للطاقة الذرية سيستمر كما في السابق.

وشددت إيران على أن عودتها إلى الالتزام بالاتفاق النووي الموقع مع الدول الكبرى في مارس/أذار 2015، يجب أن يكون مقرونا برفع الحظر وانتفاع إيران من فوائد الاتفاق.

وفي 6 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني، أعلن الرئيس الإيراني حسن روحاني بدء الخطوات الفعلية لخفض التزامات بلاده ضمن الاتفاق النووي، وذلك بضخ الغاز لأكثر من 1000 جهاز طرد مركزي.

ويأتي إعلان إيران وسط أجواء مشحونة في المنطقة، بعد مقتل قائد فيلق القدس التابع لقوات الحرس الثوري الإيراني قاسم سليماني في غارة جوية أمريكية استهدفت موكبه قرب مطار بغداد يوم الجمعة.

وفي مايو/أيار 2018، أعلن الرئيس الأمريكي دونالد ترامب انسحاب واشنطن من الاتفاق النووي، وتلى ذلك سلسلة مُستمرة من العقوبات على طهران، طالت شخصيات إيرانية، من بينهم مرشد الثورة الإيرانية علي خامنئي، إضافة إلى أجهزة وقطاعات حيوية، مثل قطاع النفط وقوات الحرس الثوري.",تخصيب اليورانيوم أصبح غير محدود.. إيران تعلن تخليها عن آخر قيود الاتفاق النووي,http://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/article/2020/01/05/iran-continue-uranium-enrichment-jcpoa,2020-01-05T00:00:00

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- قال الأمين العام لحزب الله اللبناني حسن نصر الله إن الجيش الأمريكي سيدفع ثمن قتل قائد فيلق القدس الإيراني قاسم سليماني، مُضيفا أن ""الأمريكيين سيخرجون مذلولين ومرعبوبين كما خروجوا في السابق"" من المنطقة.

تصريحات نصرالله جاءت في خطاب له، الأحد، لتأبين قائد فيلق القدس الإيراني قاسم سليماني وأبو مهدي المهندس نائب رئيس وحدات الحشد الشعبي العراقي، بعد مقتلهما في غارة جوية أمريكية في وقت مبكر من صباح الجمعة الماضي.

وأضاف نصرالله: ""القواعد العسكرية الأميركية والبوارج العسكرية الأمريكية وكل ضابط وجندي أمريكي على أرضنا وفي منطقتنا، الجيش الأمريكي هو الذي ارتكب هذه الجريمة (قتل سليماني والمهندس) والقصاص يكون ضد كل هذا الجيش في منطقتنا، وهذا لا يعني استهداف المدنيين الأمريكيين"".

كما حذر نصرالله من أن الانتحاريين ""الذين أخرجوا أمريكا من منطقتنا في السابق موجودون وأكثر بكثير من السابق... المجاهدون والمقاومون كانوا قلة قليلة في السابق واليوم هي شعوب وقوى وفصائل وجيوش وتملك إمكانات هائلة"".

وقبل تصويت البرلمان العراقي على قرار إنهاء وجود القوات الأجنبية، قال الأمين العام لحزب الله اللبناني إن ""المقاومين الشرفاء لن يبقوا جنديًا أمريكيًا في العراق"" إن لم يصوت البرلمان العراقي على قرار خروج القوات الأمريكية من البلاد.

وقال الأمين العام لحزب الله اللبناني إنه ""في العراق كان الأمريكي يراهن على ضعضعة الحشد الشعبي والفريق الوطني ويذهب العراق إلى محنة داخلية وتحصل عملية ترهيب لبقية العراقيين"".

ورأى نصرالله أن ""الأمريكيين حرصوا على فتح كل الجروح وزرع الأحقاد بين العراقيين والإيرانيين بينما في النتيجة كانت تشييع الشهداء صفا واحدًا""، في إشارة منه إلى الهتافات المناهضة لإيران، التي رددها عراقيون في الاحتجاجات المُستمرة منذ أكتوبر/تشرين الأول الماضي.

وأشار نصرالله إلى أن ""الرد العراقي بدأ بتشييع الشهداء سويًا""، لافتا إلى مشاركة عراقيين في تشييع جنازة سليماني والمهندس يوم أمس.

واعتبر نصرالله أن بداية الرد والمواجهة الإيرانية مع ""جريمة"" مقتل سليماني قد بدأت.

وفي وقت سابق من اليوم، كان رئيس الحكومة العراقية عادل عبدالمهدي قد طالب مجلس النواب باتخاذ قرار بشأن وجود القوات الأمريكية بالبلاد، مُعتبرًا أنها قامت بـ""تجاوزات مُتكررة"" عبر ""قرارات انفرادية تجريمية""، حسب تعبيره",نصرالله يلوح باستهداف الجيش الأمريكي: سيدفع ثمن مقتل سليماني.. والقصاص سيكون بكل المنطقة,http://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/article/2020/01/05/hasan-nasrallah-hezbollah-us-forces-iraq,2020-01-05T00:00:00
"دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- قال المرصد السوري لحقوق الإنسان، الأحد، إن نحو 1000 مقاتل سوري وصلوا بالفعل إلى ليبيا، لمشاركة قوات حكومة الوفاق القتال بنطاق العاصمة طرابلس في مواجهة تقدم القوات الموالية للجنرال خليفة حفتر.

أوضح المرصد، ومقره في المملكة المتحدة، أنه رصد ارتفاع عدد المجندين الذين وصلوا إلى طرابلس حتى الآن إلى نحو 1000، فيما بلغ عدد من يتلقون التدريب في معسكرات تركية 1700 مجند، بحسب ما نشره المرصد في موقعه على شبكة الإنترنت.

وأشار المرصد السوري إلى أن عمليات تجنيد المقاتلين مازالت مٌسامرة ""بشكل كبير جدًا، سواء في عفرين أو مناطق درع الفرات، التي تسيطر عليها قوات سورية موالية لتركيا.

وذكر المرصد السوري أنه كان قد رصد في 30 ديسمبر/كانون الأول الماضي، ارتفاع عدد من وصلوا معسكرات التدريب التركية إلى ما لا يقل عن 1600 من مقاتلي فصائل ""السلطان مراد وسليمان شاه وفرقة المعتصم"".

وقال المرصد السوري إن ""تجنيد المرتزقة يعتبر جريمة وفقاً للاتفاقية الدولية لمناهضة تجنيد المرتزقة واستخدامهم وتمويلهم وتدريبهم التي صدرت عن الأمم المتحدة قبل نحو 30 عامًا"".

وفي أبريل/نيسان الماضي، تحركت قوات موالية لقائد قوات شرق ليبيا الجنرال خليفة حفتر من شرق البلاد، رامية إلى السيطرة على طرابلس بدلا من حكومة الوفاق.

والليلة الماضية، تعرضت الكلية العسكرية في جنوبي طرابلس لقصف جوي، راح ضحيته عشرات من طلاب الكلية، فيما اتهمت حكومة الوفاق قوات حفتر بالوقوف وراء هذه ""المجزرة""، على حد وصفها.

ورسميًا، أصبحت ""الوفاق"" تحظى بدعم عسكري مُعلن من أنقرة بموجب موافقة البرلمان التركي الخميس الماضي على تفويض إرسال جنود إلى ليبيا، وتوقيع مذكرتي تفاهم للتعاون الأمني والعسكري وتحديد المناطق البحرية الموقعة معها في 27 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني، بينما اعترضت عليهما مصر واليونان، ووصفاها بأنها ""غير قانونية"".","المرصد السوري: 1000 ""مرتزق"" وصلوا من تركيا إلى ليبيا للقتال بجانب حكومة الوفاق",http://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/article/2020/01/05/sohr-syria-soldiers-turkey-libya,2020-01-05T00:00:00

ومع بداية عقد جديد، يبدو أنه من الأنسب أن نتطلع إلى الهياكل التي ستشكل مدننا في العام الجديد. وإليك بعض من أكثر المباني المرتقبة والتي سيتم افتتاحها أو إكمالها في عام 2020.

""Vancouver House""، كندا.

عند مشاهدة هذا المبنى من بعيد، سيظن المرء أنه يتحدى قوانين الجاذبية، فهو يلتف بشكل مدهش من قاعدته المستطيلة الشكل إلى شكل ثلاثي من الأعلى.

وصُمم هذا المبنى الفريد على يد المهندس الدنماركي، بيارك إنجلز.

ويُعد تصميمه استجابة ذكية للعديد من القيود التي حددت حجم بصمة البرج في وسط فانكوفر.

""Powerhouse Telemark""، النرويج.

تصدرت شركة ""Snøhetta"" العناوين العام الماضي بافتتاحها لأول مطعم تحت الماء في أوروبا، بالقرب من أقصى جنوب النرويج.

ولكن، نالت الشركة شهرتها أيضاً لمبانيها المبتكرة التي تتميز بكونها ذات انبعثات كربوني سالبة، والتي تُنتج طاقة أكبر مما تستهلك على مدى حياتها.

ومن أحدث مشاريعهم ""الإيجابية الطاقة"" هي ""Powerhouse Telemark"".

عندما يأتي الأمر لتصميم متحف على موقع مليء بالمباني التاريخية، واجهت شركة ""Hassell and OMA "" للعمارة مهمة تتمثل في بناء متحف معاصر مع الحفاظ على التراث المُحيط به في الوقت ذاته.

وكانت النتيجة ابتكاراً مذهلاً يتفاعل ويكمل ويلتف حول الهياكل الموجودة بالفعل.

ما زال المتحف المصري الكبير، وهو مشروع بقيمة مليار دولار على بعد كيلومترين فقط من أهرامات الجيزة، قيد الافتتاح. ويبدو أنه سيفتتح أخيراً في عام 2020.

وإضافةً إلى توفيره لمنزل دائم لآلاف الكنوز الأثرية، يرمز المتحف إلى الجهود المبذولة لإصلاح صناعة السياحة في أعقاب ثورة عام 2011.

دبي، الإمارت العربية المتحدة (CNN) -- أصبح القصر المعروف بظهوره بالمسلسل الكوميدي الأمريكي ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" أغلى عقار في كاليفورنيا بعد بيعه بنحو 150 مليون دولار.

ويشتهر العقار، والمعروف باسم ""Chartwell""، بظهوره في افتتاحية المسلسل الكوميدي الأمريكي، ""The Beverly Hillbillies""، ويقع في حي ""بيل إير"" بمدينة لوس أنجلوس.

وذكرت صحيفة ""لوس أنجلوس تايمز""، وصحيفة ""وول ستريت جورنال"" أن العقار الراقي، والمصمم على الطراز الكلاسيكي للقصور الفرنسية، والذي يقع على مساحة 10 فدان، اشتراه نجل رجل الأعمال الأسترالي، روبرت مردوخ.

ويعد عقار حي ""بيل إير"" الفاخر ثاني أغلى منزل يتم بيعه على الإطلاق في الولايات المتحدة، إذ تتجاوزه شقة عملاقة بقيمة 238 مليون دولار في مدينة نيويورك، اشتراها رائد الأعمال الملياردير كينيث غريفين في يناير/كانون الثاني.

ومنذ عام 2016، بيعت 6 منازل في لوس أنجلوس مقابل 100 مليون دولار أو أكثر، وفقاً لتقارير ""لوس أنجلوس تايمز"". وتعود ملكية قصر ""Chartwell"" إلى الملياردير أندروجيري بيرنشيو، والذي توفي في عام 2017.

وصُمم القصر، الذي تبلغ مساحته 25 ألف قدم مربع، في عام 1930، من قبل المعماراي الأمريكي سومنر سبالدنغ، مع تصميم خارجي من الحجر الجيري، وخضع القصر لعملية تجديد في الثمانينيات من قبل المصمم الداخلي الفرنسي هنري صموئيل، وذلك وفقاً لقائمة ""Gitlin Luxury Properties"".

ويضم القصر 18 غرفة نوم، و24 حماماً، وقاعة رقص، وبيت ملحق للضيوف مكون من 5 غرف نوم ومصمم من قبل المهندس المعماري والاس نيف.

ويطل القصر على مناظر بانورامية للمدينة والمحيط الهادئ، ويتميز بحمام سباحة طوله 75 قدماً، وملعب لكرة المضرب، ومعرض سيارات يتسع لـ40 سيارة، وقبو للنبيذ يحتوي على 12 ألف زجاجة نبيذ، بالإضافة إلى حدائق مشذبة مع نافورة رائعة.

ويمتلئ تصميم القصر الداخي بمظاهر الفخامة، بما في ذلك الذهب، والرخام، والثريات، بحسب مقال نشر في مجلة ""لوس أنجلوس"" عام 2000.

وطُرح القصر لأول مرة للبيع في عام 2017، مقابل 350 مليون دولار، وفقاً لموقع ""Forbes""، وكان أغلى عقار يعرض للبيع في الولايات المتحدة.

دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN)-- لوحة بديعة من الغيوم الكثيفة في سماء السعودية، تُحيط بمجموعة من الشباب، يجلسون حول مدفأة النار، التي تخلق أجواء ذات رونق خاص من الراحة والدفء.

صورة ستجعلك أسيراً لجمال سحبها الخلّاب، مما يدفعك للتمعن بتفاصيلها الدقيقة والعفوية، إلى درجة أنك قد تشكك في حقيقة الصورة، كما فعل بعض متابعي المصور السعودي، محمد الهذلي.

بعد أن وجد الهذلي مجموعة من الشباب يجلسون على قمة أحد جبال السعودية، وبالتحديد مرتفعات الهدا غرب البلاد، قرر انتهاز فرصة التقاط هذا المشهد الذي قد يندر وقوعه.

وفي حديثه مع موقع CNN بالعربية، قال المصور السعودي: ""طلبت من الشباب عدم التحرك لمدة 15 ثانية، وهي مدة سرعة الغالق بالكاميرا، لأن الحركة يمكن تؤثر على التصوير الليلي"".

وكانت الصورة قد نالت إعجاب العديد من الأشخاص، عبر وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، وبالتحديد على موقع ""تويتر""، إذ حصدت الصورة ما يزيد عن 3 ملايين و600 ألف مشاهدة.

ورغم أنها صورة واحدة التقطت خلال 15 ثانية فقط، ولكن هذا لا يعني أن محمد الهذلي لم يمر بأي تحديات، فكانت أبرزها برودة الطقس، على حد قوله.

"دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN) -- أصدرت وزيرة العدل اليابانية ماساكو موري بياناً يوم الأحد، بعد هروب الرئيس التنفيذي السابق لشركة نيسان من البلاد، كارلوس غصن، قالت به إن ""ما حدث كان أمر مؤسف للغاية"".

وقالت موري إن الحكومة ""تعمل على تأكيد الحقائق""، مضيفة أنه لا توجد أي سجلات رسمية تظهر أن غصن قد غادر اليابان فعلاً، ولذا فإن اليابان ""تعتبر أن كارلوس غصن غادر البلاد بطريقة غير شرعية وغير عادلة"".

ويعتبر هذا أول بيان رسمي لليابان بعد هروب غصن الأسبوع الماضي بينما كانت تستأنف الحكومة اليابانية أعمالها بعد عطلة رأس السنة الرسمية.

ووفقاً لوزيرة العدل، فإن كفالة غصن ألغيت، بينما أصدر الإنتربول ""مذكرة حمراء"" بناءً على طلب الحكومة اليابانية.

كما أضافت موري أن مكتب المدعي العام الياباني سيحقق بسرعة و""يبذل أقصى جهده لتوضيح وقائع هروب المتهم غصن، واتخاذ الإجراءات المناسبة"".

وقد أصدر نائب المدعي العام من مكتب المدعين العامين في طوكيو، تاكاهيرو سايتو، بياناً يقول فيه إن خروج غصن من اليابان حصل ""دون إجراء رسمي""، وأنه رغم شرط الإفراج بكفالة لحظر الهروب والسفر إلى الخارج، ""تجاهل غصن إجراءات العدالة في اليابان، ما قد يكون عملاً إجرامياً. إنه أمر مؤسف للغاية"".

وقال سايتو إن غصن كان قد حصل على إفراج بكفالة بسبب ضرورة عقد اجتماعات كافية مع فريق الدفاع والمحامين والعمل على ادعاءاته وإثباتاته لمحاكمة سلسة، مشيراً إلى أنه ""في ظل هذه الظروف، أخل غصن بوعده لحضور المحكمة والهرب من اليابان"".

يذكر أن غصن هرب من اليابان إلى وطنه الأم لبنان الأسبوع الماضي، حيث أكدت شركة التأجير التركية، MNG، أن غصن استخدم طائرتين خاصتين ""بشكل غير قانوني"" ودون علم الإدارة للفرار من إقامته الجبرية في اليابان.",أول بيان رسمي لليابان منذ هروب كارلوس غصن.. ماذا جاء به؟,http://arabic.cnn.com/business/article/2020/01/05/japan-official-statement-carlos-ghosn,2020-01-05T00:00:00
"دبي، الإمارات العربية المتحدة (CNN) -- قال وزير الدفاع البريطاني بين والاس في بيان يوم الأحد إن البحرية الملكية البريطانية ستستأنف مرافقة السفن التي ترفع علم المملكة المتحدة وتمر في مضيق هرمز، إثر تصاعد التوترات بين الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وإيران.

وقال والاس إنه أصدر تعليمات لاستعداد كل من السفينتين الحربيتين، إتش إم إس مونتروز وإتش إم إس ديفندر، ""للعودة إلى واجبات مرافقة السفن التجارية""، مؤكداً أن الحكومة ستتخذ جميع الخطوات اللازمة لحماية ""سفننا ومواطنينا في هذا الوقت"".

ويأتي قرار الحكومة البريطانية في أعقاب زيادة التوترات في المنطقة بعد مقتل قائد فيلق القدس التابع للحرس الثوري الإيراني، قاسم سليماني، في غارة جوية أمريكية.

وكانت قد اتُهمت إيران سابقاً بمهاجمة سفن راسية في أو كانت تمر عبر مضيق هرمز، حيث استولى فيلق الحرس الثوري الإيراني في يوليو/تموز من العام الماضي، ناقلة ستينا إمبيرو، التي كانت ترفع العلم البريطاني، ومن ثم أطلقت سراحها أخيراً بعد شهرين.

ويعد مضيق هرمز الذي يقع في منطقة الخليج ويفصل بين إيران من الشمال وسلطنة عمان من الجنوب، من بين أهم الممرات المائية في العالم وأكثرها استراتيجية بالنسبة لأسواق النفط، إذ يمثل الطريق الوحيدة لنقل النفط من الخليج إلى محيطات العالم، ما يعني أن أي تهديد في المنطقة يهدد أيضاً أسواق النفط.",تجدد القلق حول حرية الملاحة بمضيق هرمز.. وبحرية بريطانيا تواصل مرافقة سفنها التجارية,http://arabic.cnn.com/business/article/2020/01/05/british-navy-uk-flagged-ships-straight-hormuz,2020-01-05T00:00:00

"(CNN Business) Japanese officials on Sunday criticized Carlos Ghosn's escape from the country as ""unjust"" and vowed to tighten immigration rules in their first public remarks since the former auto executive fled for Lebanon a week ago.

Ghosn left Japan ""illegally by unjust methods,"" said Justice Minister Masako Mori, the country's top judicial official. She said that authorities have no official record of Ghosn's departure from Japan, and that prosecutors are investigating the case.

Mori also said she has ordered the country's immigration department to ""further tighten"" rules for leaving the country ""so that the same situation won't be repeated.""

Mori's statement — along with a similar one published Sunday by a Tokyo prosecutor — marked the first time Japanese authorities addressed Ghosn's stunning escape last week. Government offices in the country had been closed all week for the New Year holiday.

Ghosn — the former chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, and former chairman and CEO of their alliance partner, Renault — had been awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing . As a condition of his release on bail, Ghosn was required to stay in Japan. But the case was upended after Ghosn revealed that he had fled Japan for Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system.

"Washington (CNN) North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un said Tuesday that there ""will never"" be denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula if the US ""persists in its hostile policy towards"" the hermit nation, according to the country's state news agency.

At a meeting of ruling party officials, the North Korean leader also said his country's long term security will be guaranteed by staying on constant alert and relying on ""the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US,"" according to the Korean Central News Agency.

KCNA released the report at the end of ""The 5th Plenary Meeting of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea."" In the plenary, Kim said ""the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the US rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built.""

In an indication that North Korea could soon resume nuclear weapon testing, Kim said his country should no longer feel bound by its self-imposed halt on nuclear weapons and long-range missile testing. He also announced that ""the world will witness a new strategic weapon"" in the near future, KCNA reported.

Later Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters he was still optimistic about the future of diplomacy -- despite Kim's new rhetoric. Touting his relationship with Kim, Trump said he believed the North Korean leader was a ""man of his word.""

""He likes me, I like him, we get along,"" he said. ""He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.""

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News earlier Tuesday that he hoped Kim ""doesn't go in that direction"" and instead will ""choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.""

The US is ""hopeful"" that Kim ""will make the right decision,"" he said, also telling CBS Evening News that ""if Chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to President Trump, that is deeply disappointing.""

""We've lived up to our commitments, we continue to hold out hope that he'll live up to his as well,"" Pompeo said.

Kim was expected to give his annual New Year's speech on Wednesday -- a highly anticipated address as he had said he would only give the United States until the end of 2019 to change its negotiating strategy.

But at the time of reporting, the speech had not gone ahead. Kim had given a New Year's speech ever year since 2013, and traditionally used the address to make major announcements, update his people on a handful of government policies, and chart a direction for the country in the coming months.

A 'Christmas gift' to the US

The specific language -- North Korea referred to its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch in 2017 as a ""gift"" -- sparked speculation that Pyongyang could do something equally provocative , though the holiday came and went without any weapons test.

A source familiar with the North Korean leadership's current mindset told CNN ahead of Christmas that the ""gift"" was more likely to be a new, hardline policy in which Kim would reinforce the state ideology of self-reliance as a means of improving the economy -- a pledge Kim made to his people in 2018 -- rather than pursuing sanctions relief in exchange for denuclearization.

Trump said on Christmas Eve that the US would be ready to handle the ""gift,"" whatever it was. On Tuesday night, he again downplayed the prospect of a ""Christmas gift"" the North has threatened. ""I hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase,"" he joked.

Former national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet Wednesday that the US should ""resume all canceled or down-sized military exercises in South Korea"" in response to Kim's threat. Bolton also called on Congress to hold hearings ""on whether US troops are truly ready"" to respond to any kind of attack.

On Sunday, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the US is prepared to take action if the so-called gift is delivered, including a potential long-range missile test. Pompeo said Monday that the US is watching Pyongyang ""very closely"" in light of the ""Christmas gift"" threat.

The country had promised the gift if the US doesn't provide concessions like sanctions relief by its self-imposed, year-end deadline. The Trump administration had widely interpreted the promise of a ""Christmas gift"" to mean a weapons test, especially as intelligence indicators grew. Though no such tests have been detected from North Korea since Christmas, officials have remained watchful in the days following the holiday.

The KCNA report Tuesday said that Kim ""solemnly declared that there is no need to hesitate with any expectation of the US lift of sanctions even now that we had close look into the real intention of the US.""

The leader also said North Korea ""will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US,"" the state news agency reported.

This, Kim said, will guarantee ""our long-term security, noting that the scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated depending on the (US') future attitude (toward) the DPRK.""

Political ramifications for Trump

Kim's harder line could have political ramifications for Trump and his reelection campaign. Trump and his administration have sold the talks as an important foreign policy win, but Kim's new policy could spell a return to the tense days of 2017 when the two leaders traded insults and threats of nuclear war.

The two sides already started employing some of that rhetoric last month in the lead-up to the deadline. Trump revived his ""Rocket Man"" moniker for Kim, and North Korean state media referred to the US President as a ""dotard"" -- an archaic insult for a senile old person that Pyongyang first used to insult Trump after his address at the UN General Assembly in 2017.

While North Korea may be publicly blaming the Trump administration for the stalled talks, political calculations are also likely at play.

The source familiar with the North Korean leadership's current mindset said Pyongyang views Trump as politically vulnerable due to his impeachment and the looming 2020 presidential election.

Joseph Yun, the former US special representative for North Korea policy, weighed in on the matter on Wednesday, telling CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""Newsroom"" that ""Kim is definitely, definitely playing Trump.""

""No, (Kim) has not signed a deal for denuclearization,"" he said. ""And, in fact, if you ask most experts in and out of the government, they would agree there is no denuclearization within short-term horizon.""

Analysts believe Pyongyang is worried that if it does cut a deal with Trump and he loses in November, his successor may not uphold the accord. North Korea and the United States have reached previous agreements that did not survive successive administrations.

"Seoul (CNN) A former South Korean prime minister is one of 29 politicians charged over a mass brawl at the country's National Assembly last year that saw one lawmaker locked in his office for more than six hours.

A total of 37 people, including rival lawmakers and their aides, have been indicted on charges that include assault and violation of the National Assembly law, Seoul Southern District Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Na Byeong-hoon said in a briefing Thursday.

They include former PM Hwang Kyo-ahn, who also served as South Korea's acting president before the inauguration of current leader Moon Jae-in in 2017. Hwang is now leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party.

A total of 23 lawmakers from Hwang's party and three of their aides were charged, along with five lawmakers and five aides from the ruling Democratic Party of Korea.

The charges relate to a mass brawl in April last year, when lawmaker Chae Yi-bai and four of his aides were trapped in his office after Liberty Korea Party members blocked his door with a sofa. Chae, a member of the minority liberal-conservative Bareunmirae Party, said he considered ripping out the window to escape. He eventually got out after police arrived at the scene.

"Hong Kong (CNN) In the battle for global dominance, all eyes are on China and the United States.

With a new decade of competition looming, Washington is pushing back hard against Beijing across a range of fronts, including trade, military and diplomatic matters.

For some the tensions are reminiscent of the Cold War, the almost 50-year conflict between the Soviet Union and the US which defined much of the 20th century.

But this is not the Cold War -- and the People's Republic of China is not the USSR.

An economic juggernaut

Three decades after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, China is now richer and more stable than its powerful communist predecessor ever was -- giving it enormous global sway.

In fact, China's economy is expected to overtake the US by most economic measures by 2030, according to Herve Lemahieu, director of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute Asian Power and Diplomacy Program.

A lot of this success is down to a reinterpretation of traditional ideology. Since the death of founder Mao Zedong in 1976, the ruling Communist Party has slowly moved to embrace aspects of capitalism, in an ideological construct known locally as ""socialism with Chinese characteristics.""

Rather than ending up an anachronism of an outdated communist system, China's planned economy has been used to dramatically bolster state-owned enterprises, now some of the largest companies in the world.

""The Soviet Union focused on their military and the economy was almost an afterthought. The Soviet economy was almost entirely focused on their military,"" said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations with the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, who worked as a Soviet military expert for the US Navy during the Cold War.

China has tried to avoid falling into a trap of rapid, unsustainable military growth. While it has still steadily grown and modernized its military, the country has managed to keep its spending far below the exorbitant levels of the Soviet Union, at least publicly.

As a result, China is far more economically powerful in 2019 than the Soviet Union ever was. ""During the Cold War in the 1980s, the Soviet Union had a smaller economy than Japan,"" Lemahieu said.

Military tensions

The Soviet Union was a bold, expansive military power, and by the 1980s it had tens of thousands of military personnel and weapons posted ""in every major region of the world,"" according to US government reports

By comparison, China has appeared to show little interest in expanding far outside Asia. While it has dramatically expanded its economic and diplomatic reach in recent years, the country's military has opened just one international base -- in Djibouti, on the northeastern tip of Africa.

That isn't to say that Washington and Beijing don't engage in military brinksmanship. It's just far more localized to Asia.

Both sides have accused the other of provoking a military confrontation in the South China Sea through a rapid militarization of the region. When the US deployed a THAAD missile defense system in South Korea in 2017, relations between Seoul and Beijing went into a deep freeze.

While the threat of nuclear war also hung over the world during the Cold War, the situation with China is markedly different.

But there have been early signs that tensions over nuclear issues could grow again.

In early August, the US officially withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia which had limited the development of ground-based nuclear missiles. The US wanted Russia and China to join them in working out a new treaty -- but Beijing said no.

""If the US deploys missiles in this part of the world, at the doorstep of China, China will be forced to take countermeasures,"" said Fu Cong, Director General of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, on August 6.

Trade ties

During the Cold War, Moscow and Washington operated in separate trading spheres, competing against each other for trade from third parties.

In the modern global economy, however, relationships are far more intertwined. China is the largest trading partner for dozens of countries across the world, including major US allies like Australia, Japan and New Zealand.

""You might be an ally of the US in a security sense and consider China to be your most important trading partner. There are no clear blocs anymore, that's not how this will work,"" Lemahieu said.

Even at home, there are many more trade links between the US and China today than there were between Washington and Moscow. US President Donald Trump has long complained about the trade deficit with China, accusing Beijing of creating an unfair advantage for its own companies. In response, he kicked off a trade war in June 2018, placing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods from China.

But with the US and China exposed to each others' fiscal setbacks, further economic competition won't be a simple win-or-lose proposition, as with the Soviet Union.

""During the Cold War we weren't dealing with an interdependent global economy but essentially two major blocs that were more or less self-dependent in terms of their economic well-being,"" Lemahieu said.

Any prolonged economic conflict could be a zero-sum game for both the US and China, Lemahieu said, dragging down both economies and causing repercussions across the world.

""You might be able to hit China to such an extent that by 2030 its economy is 8% smaller, but then the US would also take a hit. It could be about 3.3% smaller,"" he said.

""I'd say the economics and the scale favors China rather than the US.""

US allies divided

While the US could argue the Soviet Union was a clear threat to world security, the case against Beijing is far less simple. In fact, some countries are finding China's offers of financial support with no political interference an attractive option.

""China has played the card that the US tried to mold the world in their image, while (Beijing) are just wanting to trade. Your government and your country is your own sovereign question and we have no say,"" Schuster said. ""That's very compelling.""

Balancing political and economic considerations has already led to divisions between the US and its previously close Cold War allies. In 2018, for example, former CIA analyst Peter Mattis gave testimony at a US congressional committee which suggested New Zealand's role in the well-established global Five Eyes alliance should be reviewed.

Comprising the US, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the intelligence gathering network traces its origins to World War II and remains a powerful diplomatic bloc. However China is now the largest trading partner for two out of the five members -- Australia and New Zealand -- and a major part of the economy for the other three.

In his 2018 testimony, Mattis said relations between the US and its partners had grown more complicated since the Cold War, when there were two very distinct global spheres -- one communist, one capitalist.

""(Now) everyone has some sort of connectivity. The US has an important role in Europe as a partner, China has an important role in Europe as a partner,"" he told CNN. ""Beijing is present in all these areas that the Soviet Union wasn't.""

The US has certainly been ramping up the rhetoric of late. Washington this year lobbied hard to stop countries from using technology from Chinese giant Huawei to build 5G networks over alleged security concerns.

Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying that there is ""no proof"" the Chinese government has any influence over it.

Australia was the first to ban Huawei from its 5G network. New Zealand has enacted a partial ban, while the UK is still deliberating.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has even threatened to stop other US partners from receiving sensitive intelligence if they didn't comply. ""It makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them,"" Pompeo said in February.

Despite the partial ban, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Chinese state-run media CGTN in April that the company was still welcome in her country.

""We already have Huawei products in New Zealand and Huawei already operates in New Zealand,"" she said.

Schuster, formerly of the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said such public divisions among Washington's close allies didn't bode well for any ambition to build a united global front against China.

""If the US can't convince the Five Eyes, the odds of successfully persuading any others not immediately and directly threatened by China will be quite small,"" he added.

The new space race

When the first unmanned rover touched down on the far side of the moon in January 2019, neither Soviet nor US-made treads disturbed the lunar dust. They were Chinese.

Fifty years after the US beat the Soviet Union to the moon, the space race is on again. Only this time it's the US and China aiming to be the next country to successfully land a person on the moon.

The new lunar race is symbolic of so much in the new state of relations between the two countries. China has caught up to the US quickly -- when US astronauts landed on the moon in 1969, China's space agency hadn't even launched a satellite -- and is now hoping to overtake it.

But even in space, the relationship is a lot more complicated than the hyper-competitive attitude of the 1960s. In fact, NASA cooperated with China's National Space Administration to monitor the Chang'e probe when it landed on the far side of the moon in January.

Speaking to the state-run China Daily in January, former NASA chief Charles Bolden said he was hopeful US government restrictions on working with China would be lifted, allowing for more space cooperation. ""We look at (the Chang'e probe landing) as an achievement for humanity,"" he said.

Former CIA analyst Mattis, who at the time was a visiting fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN that any mass move by the US government to confront China would require a marked shift from the status quo.

""Waging the Cold War required 10 years of government reform, massive policy debates and led to tens of thousands of US citizens dead in places all over the world -- hundreds of thousands, or millions, dead in places like North Vietnam and spread out around the world,"" he said.

And with memories of the true costs of the Cold War still burning, Mattis said it was understandable if US policymakers were reluctant to engage.

""The scope of it is huge,"" he said. ""But what sort of costs are we actually prepared to take?""",There's talk of a new Cold War. But China is not the Soviet Union,http://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/02/asia/us-china-cold-war-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-01-02T00:00:00

"He's not welcome in the country. He can't even phone his mother. She said it was better if he didn't, because every time he did, police would show up at her door.

So, when Elkun's father died in 2017, there was no way he could go back to China for the burial. To be closer to his family, he would view his father's grave on Google Earth.

""I know exactly where his tomb is,"" Elkun told CNN in his north London home. ""When I was a kid we would go there, pray at the mosque, visit our relatives. The entire community was connected to that graveyard.""

He ""visited"" his father like this for nearly two years. But in June, something changed. The satellite photo on Google had been updated and the graveyard that used to be there was now nothing more than a flattened, empty field.

""I had no idea what happened,"" said Elkun. ""I was completely in shock.""

Cemeteries destroyed

Elkun's story is not unique.

China appears to have been destroying traditional Uyghur cemeteries for several years as part of what critics describe as a broader, coordinated campaign to control Islamic beliefs and Muslim minority groups within its borders.

In a months' long investigation, working with sources in the Uyghur community and analyzing hundreds of satellite images, CNN has found more than 100 cemeteries that have been destroyed, most in just the last two years. This reporting was backed up by dozens of official Chinese government notices announcing the ""relocation"" of cemeteries.

The destruction of Uyghur cemeteries was first reported in October by French news agency AFP and satellite imagery analysts Earthrise Alliance. They found at least 45 cemeteries had been destroyed since 2014.

AFP reporters visited several sites of destroyed cemeteries. In some, they found several bones that scientists later confirmed from photos were human remains

CNN has identified more than 60 other gravesites that are no longer there, by cross-checking sites known to the Uyghur community abroad with satellite images taken over a number of years.

In response to CNN's request for comment, the Chinese government didn't deny the cemetery destruction.

A spokesperson with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement in part, ""Governments...in Xinjiang fully respect and guarantee the freedom of all ethnic groups... to choose cemeteries, and funeral and burial methods.""

One official notice announcing the ""relocation"" of a cemetery in western Aksu City said it needed to be moved ""to meet the demand of city planning and promote construction.""

CNN shared before and after images with five experts from Canada, the United States and Australia with experience in Uyghur culture or satellite imagery. They included Rian Thum, a respected historian who uses satellite imagery as part of his research into Islam in China.

Thum confirmed the majority of the satellite images shared with him were undoubtedly destroyed cemeteries. The other four experts verified the rest of the sites.

""It is a phenomenon that stretches right across the region of Xinjiang,"" said Thum.

At a press conference on December 16, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that citizens' freedom of religious belief is strongly protected in Xinjiang and that local people endorsed the Chinese government's measures to ""fight terrorism and maintain stability.""

Human rights crisis

China is under intense and unwelcome international scrutiny after the release of documents that appear to confirm that it is deliberately trying to alter the Uyghur people to be more like the wider mandarin-speaking Han Chinese population.

The US State Department has said up to two million people from Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, have been held in a massive network of detention camps since 2017.

China's government has consistently denied it is committing human rights abuses. It says the camps are voluntary vocational training centers, designed to stamp out religious extremism that has led to terrorist attacks.

In July, China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region Chairman Shohrat Zakir described the camps as ""vocational training centers.""

""They are not concentration camps as called by some people,"" he said. ""People arrive and leave constantly ... Most have already gone back to society.""

But leaked documents released by international media in November detailed a co-ordinated program of ""ideological"" re-education in heavily fortified detention centers, undermining Beijing's narrative.

It isn't the first evidence of a coordinated campaign against Uyghur citizens. Multiple former detainees have told CNN they were tortured inside the camps and forced to pledge loyalty to China's Communist Party.

Leaked video earlier this year showed prisoners being led from a train, while under heavy guard, blindfolded and shackled.

Outside the camps, it appears the government is trying to erase key elements of Uyghur culture.

More than a million Chinese public servants have been sent to stay with Uyghur families to ensure that they acted sufficiently patriotically. Satellite imagery and media reports suggest mosques have been destroyed across the region.

""This is absolutely a massive effort to eradicate Uyghur culture as we know it and replace it with a Chinese communist party approved culture,"" said Thum.

At a press conference on December 16, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that citizens' freedom of religious belief is strongly protected in Xinjiang and that local people endorsed the Chinese government's measures to ""fight terrorism and maintain stability.""

Gathering places

Cemeteries are important in every culture, but perhaps more so in Uyghur culture. Cemeteries are central to village life, a place to meet and connect one generation to the last.

""It's akin for an American to see Arlington cemetery razed and the tomb of the unknown soldier dug up and paved over,"" said Thum.

""People would come to a shrine or cemetery from all over the Uyghur region for the annual pilgrimage festival... People pray for health and blessings, meet neighbors, share communal feasts and shop at carnival-like markets.""

Experts and activists said cemeteries that had existed for hundreds of years were wiped out in a matter of months.

According to Uyghur activists and documents, the Sultanim Cemetery in the center of southwestern Hotan had existed in one form or another for more than 1,000 years, and was one of the most spiritually significant resting places in the city.

According to satellite images, it was completely flattened by April 2019.

Some cemeteries were redeveloped quickly with seeming disregard for the spiritual places they once were, the investigation by AFP showed, paved over and seeded with modern buildings.

Part of the Sultanim Cemetery appears to now be a parking lot.

CNN also found multiple public documents online confirming cemetery relocation in several different cities.

The May 2017 notice gave relatives just over two weeks to come and register their loved ones' graves before the removal and relocation work started. ""Those graves that have not been registered within the date will be seen as unclaimed graves,"" the notice said.

What happened to the unclaimed graves was not mentioned.

Other official reasons for the destruction include wanting to build ""civilized"" cemeteries to ""promote cultural and ideological progress.""

'Cultural genocide'

Aziz Isa Elkun doesn't know what happened to his father's remains.

Contacting his remaining family in Xinjiang, he believes, is too dangerous. For those living in the region, contact with the outside world often brings increased police scrutiny.

Amnesty International has reported that those who take calls from abroad are sometimes detained by authorities. Elkun himself is terrified that his 78-year-old mother, who he believes is not in great health, could be swept up in the dragnet by his actions.

He even fears that speaking to the international media could have negative effects for his family inside the country. But Elkun said he believes has no choice but to speak out, calling what is going on in Xinjiang a ""cultural genocide.""

""We cannot live with (the government) together anymore, they've crossed too many red lines,"" he said.

"(CNN) Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed on Thursday when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed in mountains in the north of the island.

Gen. Shen Yi-ming, 62, the Taiwan military's chief of general staff, was en route to visit troops when the UH-60M helicopter disappeared from radar near New Taipei City while carrying 13 people, including the crew.

Shen was confirmed dead along with seven other people on board, Lt. Gen. Hsiung Hou-chi of Taiwan's air force told a news conference Thursday afternoon. Five people survived.

The helicopter lost contact with base 13 minutes after taking off, at 8:07 a.m. local time, Hsiung said. He added the helicopter's condition was ""not ideal,"" and the ministry had set up a task force to investigate the cause of the incident.

Taiwan's top military official Gen. Shen Yi-ming was killed in the crash.

There was initial hope that Shen had survived, when the New Taipei City fire department announced in the morning that the general had been rescued from the scene. Department spokesman Chen Hao-feng had told CNN that Shen was found conscious by a search team and sent to hospital. But he later clarified that it was a miscommunication from the command center.

"(CNN) Severe flooding in Jakarta that's left swaths of the capital underwater has killed at least 30 people and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes, according to Indonesia's disaster agency.

Torrential rains have been pounding the greater Jakarta region since New Year's Eve, causing 62,453 people to be evacuated to temporary shelters, the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management said in a statement Thursday.

Most of the victims died in Bogor district and East Jakarta, the agency said. Among the dead, 17 were swept away by the floods, five were buried by landslides and five were electrocuted.

Heavy rains are predicted to continue through to January 10, it added.

Heavy flooding has dispaced tens of thousands of people.

"(CNN) It's 2020 -- and with the Lunar New Year just weeks away, farmers in Vietnam have come up with a unique way to herald the Year of the Rat.

These bonsai trees are shaped to look like rats, and were made to order in small quantities. They take about a year to grow, and a meticulous hand is required to shape them so that all the fruits are exposed, CNN affiliate VTV reported.

Kumquats -- a citrus fruit with a sour tang -- are growing on the ornamental trees. And the more ripe fruit a tree has, the higher its price, with the bonsais costing up to $215.

It's believed that the more kumquat fruits on the tree, the luckier your family will be in the new year.

The kumquat tree has deep orange-colored fruits, and is a popular ornamental plant in Vietnam and parts of Asia during Lunar New Year because its many fruits symbolize fertility, abundance and luck. It's believed that the more fruit on the tree, the luckier your family will be in the new year.

The first day of the Lunar New Year, known as Tet in Vietnam, falls on January 25 and marks the start of the Year of the Rat in the Chinese zodiac. Many people who celebrate the festival prepare by spring cleaning and decorating their homes.

Expensive ornamental fruit trees are a trend in Vietnam for the forthcoming Lunar New Year.

"(CNN) Australian officials are pushing ahead with Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks display despite more than a quarter of a million people signing a petition calling for the event to be scrapped.

The Change.org petition said the funds that would normally be spent on the dazzling firework display should be redistributed towards the firefighting efforts.

The City of Sydney has faced increasing pressure to cancel the event in recent weeks. The state of New South Wales -- of which Sydney is the capital -- has been the hardest hit by the prolonged fire season. Conditions are expected to deteriorate over the next two days, the state's Rural Fire Service (RFS) said on Twitter Monday.

Linda McCormick, who started the petition over a month ago, said the money should be given to ""farmers and firefighters"" to ""save Australia's wildlife."" She argued that the fireworks could ""traumatise some people as there is enough smoke in the air."" The online petition had been signed by more than 270,000 people by Monday morning.

New Year's Eve fireworks erupt over Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House during the fireworks show on January 1, 2019.

Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore said she had ""been moved by the outpouring of support and care for the community"" but that the event would continue as planned.

Commenting directly on the petition, Moore said, ""Our fireworks are planned 15 months in advance and most of the budget -- which is largely allocated to crowd safety and cleaning measures -- has already been spent.""

Moore also tweeted Sunday in response to the petition writing, ""I appreciate the calls people have made to cancel our New Year's Eve event, but rather than doing that we're using the huge reach of #SydNYE to encourage people around the world to support the @RedCrossAU's important work of helping people who have been affected by disaster.""

Earlier this month, organizers from the City of Sydney said scrapping the show ""would have little practical benefit for affected communities.""

""(Canceling) the event would seriously hurt Sydney businesses. It would also ruin plans for tens of thousands of people from across the country and overseas who have booked flights, hotels and restaurants for New Year's Eve,"" the council said in a statement.

Organizers said they had donated $620,000 Australian dollars (almost $433,000) ""to support communities and wildlife impacted by bushfire and drought, and offered our trucks and staff to help emergency services with cleanup and recovery efforts."" The council added that the display will be ""greener"" this year using fireworks that are carbon offset.

However, elected officials appear to be divided. John Barilaro, the deputy premier of New South Wales, said on Twitter Monday he believes the fireworks should be canceled.

""The risk is too high and we must respect our exhausted RFS volunteers. If regional areas have had fireworks banned, then let's not have two classes of citizens. We're all in this crisis together,"" he said.

Sydney's New Years Eve Fireworks should just be canceled, very easy decision. The risk is too high and we must respect our exhausted RFS volunteers. If regional areas have had fireworks banned, then let's not have two classes of citizens. We're all in this crisis together. — John Barilaro MP (@JohnBarilaroMP) December 29, 2019

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Sunday the fireworks should go ahead because it is ""important to send a message to the world.""

""On New Year's Eve the world looks at Sydney. Every single year. And they look at our vibrancy, they look at our passion, they look at our success, and they all think to themselves, 'What an amazing place!' They are right! And so in the midst of the challenges that we have faced, subject to the safety considerations, I can think of no better time to express to the world just how optimistic and positive we are as a country,"" the prime minister said.

CNN reached out to Morrison's office for response to the petition, but has not yet heard back.

The Change.org petition claimed Sydney spent $5.8 million Australian ($4 million) on last year's display. CNN has not been able to verify this amount.

While the fireworks look set to go ahead in Sydney, organizers in the Australian capital of Canberra have scrapped their event after a total fire ban was put in place.

For more than two months, deadly bushfires have been burning out of control across Australia and engulfing whole towns , exacerbated by strong winds and rising temperatures.

Australia has experienced one of the worst droughts in decades and sweltered under a record-breaking heat wave last week, when the average maximum temperature across the country hit 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 Fahrenheit). At least nine people are dead, and one is missing.

More than 900 homes have been destroyed, according to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.

On Sunday, authorities in the state of Victoria warned residents and vacationers in the East Gippsland area to evacuate as fire danger in the area increased.

Everyone in East Gippsland must leave the area today due to the fire danger forecast for tomorrow. Do not travel to this area. It is not possible to provide support and aid to all the visitors currently in the East Gippsland region.

""If you're planning on visiting East Gippsland today or Monday, don't do it,"" Andrew Crisp, the emergency management commissioner, said in a statement . ""If you're already visiting East Gippsland, you need to leave the area today.""

""It is not possible to provide support and aid to all the visitors currently in the East Gippsland region, and if the Princes Highway is impacted, you may not be able to leave for some time. If you live in East Gippsland, you need to move to safer locations,"" Crisp added.

Earlier Sunday, Morrison announced that, in conjunction with the New South Wales government, the Australian Federal Government would compensate the state's volunteer firefighters for loss of income.

Amid mounting criticism and political pressure, Morrison told reporters: ""What the commonwealth will be doing together with the states who will administer the payments is to be providing payments for income lost by firefighters -- rural fire service volunteers -- here in New South Wales. That will be paid with a maximum of up to $6,000 per individual.""

""As this is a very prolonged fire season, this is putting additional demands on our firefighters in particular and it means that the turnouts and the callouts have been far more extensive than in previous years, going well and beyond and above what is normally expected of those who are engaged in volunteer service,"" the conservative leader added.",Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks display to go on amid bushfire threat,http://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/29/asia/sydney-new-year-fireworks-intl/index.html,2019-12-29T00:00:00
"(CNN) A typical scene unfolds in India: angry crowds flood the streets in a mass outcry after yet another woman or girl falls victim to sexual violence.

The gang-rape and murder of a woman in the southern city of Hyderabad earlier this month gave rise to protests across the country. The chanting crowds reflected uproar seen in 2012, after the notorious gang-rape and murder of a student in the capital, New Delhi.

But cultural values held behind the closed doors of family homes are a part of the problem that is being protested against: privilege for boys and submissiveness for girls.

""Girls are trained not to exist,"" says Deepa Narayan , an author and independent adviser on international poverty, gender and development. ""You (girls) don't need any power. And if you want power there's something wrong with you and you're being bad.""

'Patriarchy pretends men are kings'

India's preference for boys is prevalent even before birth. Sex-selective abortion in the country has distorted the natural sex ratio, in favor of males, according to the World Health Organization.

it can lead to Some experts say the practice is becoming less common but for girls,it can lead to poorer allocation of household resources and medical care, neglect, and even infanticide.

""In some families, during a girl's birth, the welcome is more muted. But a boy's birth is welcomed to a drum; buying expensive sweets and telling everyone that a boy is born, a boy is born,"" says Narayan, who has more than 25 years of experience working at the World Bank, the United Nations and NGOs.

But this is not a result of ""evil"" parenting, she tells CNN. ""This is all done under the rubric of love. It's not conscious. In India, they call it adjusting (to the culture).""

However, this type of conditioning can have detrimental effects. ""Boys are not taught dialogue. Their needs are just met, they're never told 'no.' They're told not to cry. Where does all that anger and rage go? Women go into depression and men lash out.""

Narayan argues that the mental health of Indian women ""is a totally neglected area.""

In fact, 36.6% of global suicide deaths among women occur in India. Furthermore, Indian women who took their lives were more likely to be married, to be from more developed states, and aged below 35.

But a male dominated society is bad for men too. ""Patriarchy lifts them, pretends that they are kings. But no human being can lift up to such high expectations,"" says Narayan. ""That's why it's so difficult for men to apologize because they are expected to be always right, godlike figures and providers.

""Nobody is happy, but we're not breaking this apart. Things would change much faster if we actively engaged men in conversation.""

'Rapists put their mothers on pedestals'

A woman who interviewed 61 convicted rapists detained in India's largest prison agrees.

Dr Madhumita Pandey, originally from India and now a Criminology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, was only 22 years old when she carried out her doctoral research at Tihar Jail in Delhi. The men convicted of the infamous 2012 gang rape are held in the same complex.

These conversations are ""missing"" from discussions on sexual violence against women, Pandey tells CNN.

""A lot of them actually found the conversation (with me) very cathartic,"" she says. ""How can you reflect on your actions if you're not even going to speak about it?""

The attackers, interviewed between 2013 and 2017, seemed like any other men, Pandey says. They also shared views that reflected Indian society's perception of the gender division of labor, with women ""in charge of raising the family and taking care of household chores"" and men as ""outdoor agents.""

This especially came to light in their relationships with their mothers and sisters.

""Of all the men that I spoke to, there were only a handful that didn't share a good relationship with their mothers. Everyone else put the mother on this pedestal.""

Pandey says this is due to the absence of fathers for some of the men while they were growing up, and the idea that they were the preferred child.

'India needs sex education'

Many of the culprits had older sisters. However, the men felt they were the favorite child because their mothers were elated to have finally conceived a boy, leading to unearned privileges such as being fed first. ""Mothers were playing a very crucial role in setting gender role standards,"" says Pandey.

The rapists didn't express remorse and described themselves as ""inmates"" instead of offenders, often blaming their victims, Pandey says. She puts this down to a lack of understanding of their actions. Pandey advocates for restorative justice, delivered to convicted attackers during their lengthy jail terms, so they may emerge as reformed individuals.

Although the men she interviewed were generally uneducated and from low socio-economic backgrounds, she stresses that this status does not correlate with violent behavior against women and that people from privileged backgrounds may have the wealth and means to evade justice.

Pandey argues that prevention can happen in schools. ""We need educational institutions to introduce some form of comprehensive sexuality education. It's crucial that there's more awareness regarding sexual violence. We need to be telling people about active consent, about toxic masculinity and the younger we get to people, the better it is.""

JUST WATCHED The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back 02:03

'And then another rape happens'

Zero-tolerance towards everyday misogynism is also key, Pandey says. ""There's so much outrage when there is a rape case. Where is the outrage when day-to-day experiences of women are also highlighting abuse in some shape or form?"" These behaviors, she says, lead to more extreme crimes.

The crimes also happen in the home. Shockingly, 93.1% of rape offenders were neighbors, relatives or prospective marital partners of the victim, according to National Crime Records Bureau data from 2017 . And marital rape is not criminalized in the country.

But mass outrage is expressed in India for attacks outside of the home, not within it.

""People don't make the link between someone else's terrible, extreme behavior and their own everyday behavior in the home, the offices and the streets. I think that's the missing link,"" says Narayan.

The death penalty that is often demanded in rallies also doesn't kill the problem.

""The men will get hanged, people will feel that the government has done their duty, and you're going to go back to sleep. And then another rape happens,"" says Pandey.

'Crack the shame around rape'

Collective outrage can spur change, Narayan says.

""Protests are an opportunity to start talking about sexual violence. Before the (2012 Delhi gang rape), even the word rape, you couldn't really use it. It's beginning to crack the shame around rape,"" she says.

""It's really a people's movement ... getting out to the streets without guns, without anything, embarking in protest, is a very courageous act.""

The demands are getting through to some leaders. Most recently, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that his government would make schoolboys sign pledges to not commit crimes against girls or women. Mothers and sisters are also encouraged to engage in discussions with boys and warn them against wrongdoing. Narayan highlights this as an important step.

The need to engage boys is being implemented by some organizations in the country, such as the Equal Community Foundation, based in the western city of Pune. ""Women's empowerment initiatives will continue to yield lower results due to the backlash that they face from the men and boys in their families who continue to be socialized into patriarchal norms,"" ECF's executive director Christina Furtado tells CNN.

The NGO overcame the reluctance to fund male-focused initiatives by relaying the long-term benefits of working with boys.

In the meantime, however, India still ranks 125 out of 162 countries on the UN's Gender Inequality Index.

People flooding the streets to express a chorus of disapproval for abuse against women is a powerful display that can be difficult to ignore. But once the streets clear and everyone retreats behind closed doors, the message must be firmly driven home.","Indians are right to protest against rape, but what are boys taught about privilege at home?",http://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/27/asia/india-rape-education-intl-hnk/index.html,2019-12-27T00:00:00
"""Aroon"" and ""Somchai"" are pseudonyms used to protect the privacy of two heroin users.

Hong Kong (CNN) Aroon's eyes rolled back into his head, his breath became fast and labored, and his body started to quiver.

It was a drug overdose.

Aroon had just injected what he thought was heroin with his friend Somchai, who recounted the ordeal to CNN.

Somchai said he took a larger hit but assumes his years of regular heroin use had given him a higher tolerance than Aroon. Somchai and Aroon are not their real names. CNN is using pseudonyms to protect their privacy.

Aroon was one of three people who overdosed from the same batch of drugs at the same harm reduction meeting in the Thai capital in September, said Pascal Tanguay, a Bangkok-based expert in drug issues and policy. All three survived.

Tanguay suspected the trio could have unwittingly taken fentanyl, the powerful synthetic opioid that has ravaged the United States in recent years.

So, he convinced one user to give him a small sample and tested the drug using strips he obtained from a US-based NGO. The results confirmed what experts have long feared -- that fentanyl, the synthetic drug produced in vast quantities in mainland China, was being mixed with heroin in Thailand.

""This is the first indication we've had confirming that it's in heroin supply in Bangkok,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's top official in Southeast Asia.

""The United States was ready compared to Asia. This region is not ready."" Jeremy Douglas, United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime

Douglas called Tanguay's finding a ""canary in the coal mine."" Fentanyl had shown in up the heroin supply in the closest major city to southern China and the Golden Triangle, the border region where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet that has long been notorious for drug production and vice.

Experts say the overdoses should alarm local authorities given how deadly the synthetic opioid crisis has been in the United States in recent years.

An illicit fentanyl crisis on the same scale as the US would be ""brutal"" in Asia, Douglas said, due to a lack of public awareness campaigns, treatment facilities and a widespread ingrained perception that drug users are criminals.

""The United States was ready compared to Asia -- this region is not ready,"" he said.

The Thai Office of Narcotics Control Board did not respond to an email seeking comment for this story.

This bag of drugs was thought to be heroin. Tanguay said it tested positive for fentanyl.

A new version of an old problem

Though fentanyl may be relatively new compared to heroin, both are opioids: a class of drugs with a long, dark history in Asia.

Natural opiates sourced from poppy plants, like opium, have been consumed on the continent for centuries -- both as a painkiller and smoked as a recreational drug.

The British empire made a vast fortune by sending opium from its Indian colony to customers throughout Asia. Rulers in China and Southeast Asia unsuccessfully fought to eradicate the opium trade, unable to counter the incredible economic and military might of the British empire and its trading arm, the British East India Company.

Most notably, the emperor of the Qing dynasty in China attempted to make opium trade and cultivation illegal. In response, Britain went to war to keep its largest opium market and won, a loss the Chinese still consider a humiliation today. And for much of the 20th Century, the majority of the world's opium and heroin came from the Golden Triangle.

""Southeast Asia and China have had a longstanding history of opium abuse,"" said Bryce Pardo, a researcher at the RAND Corporation who focuses on drug policy. ""It is entirely possible that you could see a return to those long-running, entrenched drug-use patterns, just with new chemicals.""

Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are made to mimic the chemical structure of poppy-based drugs. Both bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.

As the brain becomes used to the feelings, it takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to depetndence and, later, addiction.

Synthetics opioids are much more potent than plant-based ones. And because synthesizing drugs is cheaper and more reliable than farming plants, they can be produced at a fraction of the cost. That's part of the reason US pharmaceutical companies marketed prescription opioids aggressively ahead of the crisis in North America, experts said.

Pardo said the opioid crisis in the US was unique because not many other countries ""allow private interests so much power in terms of designing policies,"" from the way corporations were permitted to market the drugs directly to consumers and lobby the government to assess hospitals on pain relief.

""The (pharmaceutical) industry oversold the benefits and really tried to hide the costs associated with prescription pain medications. And that's particular to the United States,"" Pardo said.

""We just overdid it when it came to treating pain in this country.""

Pardo and other experts say that Asia is believed to have millions of heroin users just based on the massive number of people that live in China, India and Southeast Asia.

But precise numbers are hard to come by due to a lack of research in the region and the stigma associated with drug use.

""Probably the largest share of drug users in the world is in Asia, we just don't know it because they're not doing the regular surveys (on drug use),"" Pardo said. ""A third of the world's population lives in this region. So it could be very well they have the largest share of drug users, including heroin users.""

Though Pardo and Dogulas both said that Tanguay's finding suggested at least some fentanyl has been mixed into the heroin supply in Bangkok, the experts who spoke to CNN agreed that it is incredibly difficult to paint an accurate picture of the regional situation.

There just isn't enough data to determine if a synthetic opioid crisis is imminent or is already here.

But that doesn't mean analysts are not concerned.

""Fentanyl mimics heroin. It's far more profitable then heroin, so it's a matter of time before it gets pushed into the heroin market,"" said Douglas of the UNODC. ""We've seen what the impacts can be. You don't cut it right, you have (an) overdose. And this region is not ready for an overdose epidemic.""

Supplying an existing market

Douglas said if drug dealers were to switch to fentanyl, they wouldn't have to grow a new market -- they'd just replace heroin, the already existing product, with something more powerful, cheaper to make and already produced nearby in China. It's ""more the model of Uber taking over a taxi fleet,"" Douglas said.

That's essentially what happened to one of the older group of heroin addicts affected by the opioid crisis in the United States, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at Brandeis University's Institute for Behavioral Health and the co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative.

These weren't people who became addicted to prescription pills. They are a group of mostly men who were still using after surviving the heroin epidemic of the 1970s and the AIDS crisis after, Kolodny said.

""These men managed to beat the odds for the past 40 or 50 years with their heroin addiction. Once illicit fentanyl emerged (in the heroin supply), deaths in this group began to skyrocket"" because so many users were unwittingly overdosing, Kolodny explained.

Kolodny and the other experts interviewed by CNN worry Asia's heroin users could start dying at similar rates if synthetic opioids go mainstream.

Branching out from meth

A synthetic opioid crisis in Asia could be particularly devastating because the region is already dealing with what is believed to be the world's biggest methamphetamine problem.

Drug dealers in the region have invested in meth and other lab-made drugs in recent years because synthetic drugs are far cheaper to make than ones that require farming. They are less reliant on climate and labs are much easier to hide than fields of poppies.

Today, the region is awash with meth because drug dealers have sold it at extremely low prices to create a huge customer base. The UNODC said earlier this year the Asia-Pacific trade meth trade is now worth between $30 billion and $61 billion annually.

And Asian syndicates have since become so incredibly profitable that they can write off multimillion dollar busts as the cost of doing business

Analysts are concerned that drug dealers will diversify their portfolios and start pumping out synthetic opioids in addition to the host of illicit substances they are already manufacturing. Douglas' UNODC reported earlier this year that it appears drug manufacturers have started making both meth and and ketamine, a horse tranquilizer-turned party drug.

But a lot of questions about the rise of fentanyl -- and Aroon's overdose -- remain unanswered.

Though Aroon's incident may be the first official confirmation of illicit synthetic opioids in the Bangkok heroin market, Somchai believes fentanyl has been around for at least a few months, because the stuff he has been injecting over that time period has been so strong.

He also said he's seen more people overdose in recent months, some of whom have died.

But Somchai's story is only that, a story -- it does not highlight any statistical trend as far as the prevalence of synthetic opioids in Southeast Asia. Drug analysts in the region are often forced to rely on such anecdotal evidence and hearsay, because they lack the proper data points to draw conclusions.

That doesn't change the fact that the concerns are real, especially as the region is already struggling to cope with the tremendous increase in methamphetamine use and abuse.

""Sadly, governments in the region don't really care about those on the edge of society like drug users,"" said Douglas. ""They continue to arrest them, they generally treat them like criminals not medical patients. And that's fundamentally part of the problem too.""",Opioid crisis: Synthetic opioids ravaged the US during the last decade.

"Hong Kong (CNN) The death toll from a powerful typhoon that lashed the Philippines over Christmas has risen to 47, with another nine people still missing, authorities said on Monday morning local time

Typhoon Phanfone, known locally as Ursula, made landfall in Eastern Samar province on December 24, bringing heavy rain and storm surges. It hit as the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane, packing sustained wind speeds of 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour, with gusts of 195 kph (121 mph).

It then swept west across the islands of the Eastern Visayas region, southern Luzon and Western Visayas on Christmas Day, causing widespread travel disruption over the busy Christmas period in a majority Catholic region. Images from the area showed debris blocking roads, downed lamp posts, crumpled houses and people huddling in evacuation centers.

In total nearly 2 million people were affected, more than 378,000 houses were damaged and 143 people were injured, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said Monday.

Debris from floods caused by Typhoon Phanfone surround a damaged house in Balasan Town, Iloilo province, central Philippines on Thursday.

The NDRRMC said that the typhoon caused about $21.3 million in damage to infrastructure and agriculture.

But at the dawn of a new decade, it seems fitting to look ahead at the structures set to shape our cities -- and architecture itself -- in the coming year.

From museums and skyscrapers, to a hotel with a hole in it, these are CNN Style's most anticipated buildings opening or completing in 2020.

Vancouver House, Vancouver, Canada

BIG / Luxigon

Twisting from a triangular base to a rectangular top, Vancouver House appears to defy the laws of engineering when viewed from afar.

It's precisely the sort of eccentricity we've come to expect from Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect who recently built a ski slope on top of a power plant in Copenhagen. But it's also a smart response to various restrictions and regulations that limited the size of the tower's footprint in downtown Vancouver.

The pixelated facade, also characteristic of Ingels' work, helps to create deep-set balconies for residents in the 493-foot-tall tower.

Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center, Nanjing, China

MAD Architects

Taking inspiration from traditional Chinese ""shanshui"" paintings (literally ""mountain and water""), Ma Yansong's curved creations merge nature with the built environment. This new 23-acre development in the historic city of Nanjing is surely the most ambitious realization of the architect's ""shanshui city"" concept to date.

Irregular white fins give the complex's towers the appearance of icy mountains, their flowing lines contributing to what Beijing-born Ma's firm, MAD, describes as a ""philosophy of cooperation between humanity and nature."" At ground level, six separate plots are connected via man-made streams and footbridges.

With the country's authorities pushing for increasingly conservative architecture , the complex is a refreshing reminder of what bold Chinese architecture can look like.

Powerhouse Telemark, Porsgrunn, Norway

Bloomimages / Snøhetta

Snøhetta made international headlines last year when its underwater restaurant -- Europe's first -- opened near the southernmost tip of Norway. But the design firm has also gained a reputation for innovative carbon-negative buildings that, over their lifetimes, produce more energy than they consume.

Located on the banks of the Porsgrunn River, the practice's latest ""energy-positive"" project, Powerhouse Telemark, has been designed to ""set a new standard for the construction of the buildings of tomorrow.""

Everything about the sleek structure, which is almost entirely coated in photovoltaic cells, has its carbon footprint in mind, from a diamond shape that maximizes the solar energy it captures, to the use of recycled materials from local demolition projects.

New Museum of Western Australia, Perth, Australia

Peter Bennetts / Hassell / OMA

In designing a museum on a site littered with historic buildings, architecture firms Hassell and OMA faced a delicate task: building a 21st-century museum while preserving the surrounding heritage.

The result is a striking contemporary creation that complements, interacts with and wraps around existing structures -- some of which date back to the mid-19th century -- producing an unlikely synergy of brick, glass and steel.

Perhaps the most striking feature is how the museum's huge upper volume hangs dramatically over Hackett Hall, the State Library's old reading room.

Grand Egyptian Museum, Cairo, Egypt

Such have been the delays facing the Grand Egyptian Museum that it featured on this very list two years ago -- and the $1-billion project is still yet to open.

Having said that, 2020 looks sure to be the year it finally does. As well as offering a permanent home to tens of thousands of archeological treasures, including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb, the 5.2-million-square-foot museum symbolizes efforts to repair the country's tourism industry in the wake of the 2011 revolution.

The building's glass-fronted design, first unveiled over 15 years ago, will offer sweeping panoramas of the Great Pyramids and Giza plateau.

Berlin Brandenburg Airport, Berlin, Germany

Berlin's new Brandenburg airport is, perhaps, less anticipated for its design than for the fact it's almost a decade late.

Following years of setbacks, the German capital's new transport hub is finally due to open its doors in 2020. And while it wouldn't be the project's first missed deadline (officials initially expected it to open in October 2011), there seems to be an air of certainty about the recent announcement that the airport would enter operation in October.

The terminal building, which sits between two parallel runways, was designed to represent the region's architectural heritage. Official press materials cite the influence of 19th-century Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the celebrated Bauhaus art school.

Opus, Dubai, UAE

Laurian Ghinitoiu / Zaha Hadid Architects

More than three years after her death, Zaha Hadid continues to shape the world's cities with her bold, curvilinear creations.

Opus, which was first proposed by the British-Iraqi architect in 2007, takes the form of a glass-fronted cube punctured with an asymmetric hole that appears to bulge at the seams. Yet, closer inspection reveals that the building is formed from two separate towers joined by a four-story atrium at its base and a footbridge connecting the upper floors.

The structure will house a boutique hotel -- with interiors also designed by Hadid -- as well as office space and restaurants. Despite being located just a kilometer from the 2,717-feet-tall Burj Khalifa, it might yet be the neighborhood's most eye-catching piece of architecture.

1000 Trees, Shanghai, China

British designer Thomas Heatherwick has never been short of ambition. And now his seemingly farfetched vision of a tree-covered urban mountain has become a reality.

The 3.2-million-square foot development now occupies a huge stretch of riverside in Shanghai. Structural columns emerge from the structure's mass to hold some of the plants and greenery alluded to in the project's name, 1000 Trees.

More than a piece of architecture, this is, in Heatherwick Studio's own words, ""a piece of topography.""

Set across a huge swathe of reclaimed land in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, the West Kowloon Cultural District has been more than 20 years in the making. And of the many theaters and cultural institutions set to eventually open in the development, none are more hotly anticipated than M+.

The museum is expected to have one of the Asian continent's most impressive collections of contemporary visual art. Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron has built a visually arresting design to boot -- a horizontal slab (containing exhibitions spaces) and a vertical one (housing everything else) conjoined into an upside-down ""T.""

Although the building is set to complete within the next few months, it will be another nine to 12 months before it is opened to the public. Nonetheless, the completion of M+ is a major milestone for the long-awaited cultural quarter.

Singapore Pavilion at the Dubai Expo 2020, Dubai, UAE

Singapore Pavilion, Expo 2020 Dubai

From October, Expo 2020 will see hundreds of participating countries construct pavilions in and around Dubai. There will be plenty of impressive architecture on display, from Canada's circular wooden theater to Austria's ensemble of huge interlocking cones

But perhaps the most ambitious idea is that of Singapore: to create an oasis in the Arabian desert.

The city-state's pavilion will bring dense greenery to the UAE, with canopies leading visitors through a lush hanging garden of trees, shrubs and orchids. And the architecture firm behind the project, WOHA, thinks it can make the project energy neutral over the course of the expo.

The fashion world is no stranger to controversy, and this year has been no exception.

From allegations of cultural appropriation to tactless sartorial gaffes, we remember the brands and celebrities who made waves with decisions that many perceived as insensitive, out of touch and noninclusive.

Burberry's 'noose' hoodie

In February the British brand caused a major stir at London Fashion Week for showcasing a hoodie with strings resembling a noose.

Liz Kennedy, the model who wore the look down the runway, criticized the design with a post directed at the brand and its chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci. ""Suicide is not fashion,"" she wrote on Instagram.

Burberry pulled the hoodie and Tisci apologized: "" I am so deeply sorry for the distress that has been caused as a result of one of the pieces in my show,"" he said in a statement.

""While the design was inspired by a nautical theme, I realize that it was insensitive. It was never my intention to upset anyone.""

Gucci's 'blackface' sweater

The Italian brand came under fire for a series of questionable looks starting in February, when it released a balaclava-style sweater that critics said resembled blackface.

Featuring a roll-up collar with a wide red lip outline, the garment, priced at $890, provoked a torrent of criticism. ""I am a black man before I am a brand ... There is no excuse nor apology that can erase this kind of insult,"" Gucci collaborator Dapper Dan posted to Twitter.

The sweater was pulled, and in an exclusive interview with fashion publication WWD , Gucci chief executive Marco Bizzarri said, ""This is due to the ignorance of this matter. Certainly, it was not intentional, but this is not an excuse.""

Bizzarri went on to meet Dapper Dan and African American community leaders in Harlem, New York, and declared the label would encourage diversity hires and launch a diversity and inclusivity awareness program.

But the brand made two other controversial moves this year. One was selling a headwrap they dubbed the ""Indy Full Turban"" on luxury e-tailer Nordstrom for $790, which saw the Sikh Coalition tweet its disappointment this spring. The other was sending a slew of straitjackets down the runway at Milan Fashion Week in September, again sparking criticism.

Model Ayesha Tan Jones, who identifies as non-binary, held up their hands while walking the show to reveal the words ""Mental Health Is Not Fashion"" inked across their palms.

Katy Perry's 'blackface' shoes

Another misstep came in February courtesy of Katy Perry Collections, the fashion line launched by the pop star back in 2017, which was accused of using blackface designs for two of its footwear styles. The models in question, the Ora Face Block Heel Sandals and Rue Face Slip-On Loafers, prominently featured a face that was likened to the racist ""Sambo"" slave caricature. After complaints from the public they were removed from stores and online.

In a joint statement, Perry and Global Brands Group, the apparel company backing her venture, said the shoes were ""envisioned as a nod to modern art and surrealism.""

""I was saddened when it was brought to my attention that it was being compared to painful images reminiscent of blackface,"" Perry added. ""Our intention was never to inflict any pain.""

Calvin Klein's ad starring Bella Hadid and Lil Miquela

For its May ""I Speak My Truth in #MyCalvins"" campaign video, model Bella Hadid was pictured making out with CGI influencer Lil Miquela . ""Life is about opening doors,"" Hadid narrates in the video, before she and the avatar fall into a lengthy kiss.

The message didn't land, with critics accusing the brand of using lesbian sexual imagery to sell clothing, describing it as "" queerbaiting "" since Hadid does not identify as gay.

Calvin Klein quickly issued an apology on Twitter , explaining that the concept of the campaign was to ""promote freedom of expression for a wide range of identities.""

""As a company with a longstanding tradition of advocating for LGTBQ+ rights,"" the statement said, ""it was certainly not our intention to misrepresent the LGTBQ+ community.""

Kim's Kimono line

Kim Kardashian West found herself at the center of a cultural appropriation controversy earlier this year. In June, the celebrity announced the launch of lingerie line ""Kimono.""

On social media, she called Kimono her ""take on shapewear and solutions for women that actually work.""

The backlash was swift . Critics perceived the use of ""kimono"" as an insult to Japan's national dress. Two days after the announcement, the hashtag #KimOhNo was trending on Twitter.

Kyoto mayor Daisaku Kadokawa wrote to Kardashian West asking her to drop the name. ""Kimono is a traditional ethnic dress fostered in our rich nature and history with our predecessors' tireless endeavors and studies, and it is a culture that has been cherished and passed down with care,"" he wrote.

At first the star defended her choice, saying it was a ""nod to the beauty and detail"" of the traditional Japanese garment. But eventually she relented, posting on Instagram in August to say she'd renamed the brand Skims Solutionwear, which launched in September.

Dior's Sauvage ad

In August, Dior teased a new ad on social media for its perfume line, starring Johnny Depp in a red rock desert in Southwestern Utah, where he plays a riff by Shawnee guitarist Link Wray. It also featured performer Canku One Star, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, dancing in traditional Native American clothing, and Canadian actor of First Nations descent Tanaya Beatty. As night falls on this scene, the word ""Sauvage"" appears.

Critics accused the fashion house of reinforcing stereotypes by using Native American imagery and pairing it with the word ""savage,"" which many interpreted as a racial insult.

Dior, who said it had worked with Native American consultants and the advocacy group Americans for Indian Opportunity, withdrew the clip and canceled the video ad release. The follow-up statement said, ""We are deeply sorry for any offense caused by this new advertising campaign, which was meant to be a celebration of the beauty, dignity and grace of the contemporary Native American culture.""

Vans protest sneakers

Vans landed in hot water in Hong Kong in October, when it removed a sneaker whose design alluded to the city's anti-government protests. The proposed design was one of the submissions to the streetwear brand's annual Custom Culture competition, which sees hopefuls submit their ideas to a public online vote, with the winner receiving $25,000 and getting their design into production.

The submission, by Canada-based artist Naomiso, depicted a red bauhinia flower, Hong Kong's emblem, and protesters wearing gas masks, goggles and hard hats. It rose to the top of the poll but was abruptly taken down by the brand.

Supporters of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement saw this as Vans kowtowing to mainland Chinese consumers. ""This is a big move against the freedom of speech of all Hong Kong freedom fighters,"" said one critic on Twitter.

In a statement posted on its Facebook page after it removed the design, Vans said: ""We have never taken a political position and therefore review designs to ensure they are in line with our company's long-held values of respect and tolerance, as well as with our clearly communicated guidelines for this competition.""

The apology fell short for sneakerheads in the SAR. The hashtag #BoycottVans gained traction online, and some dumped their shoes in trash bins.

Givenchy, Versace and Coach 'disrespect' Chinese sovereignty

Weibo users criticized how the Coach T-shirt describes the status of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Credit: via Weibo

In August, Versace, Givenchy and Coach were accused of disrespecting Chinese sovereignty by releasing T-shirts that listed Hong Kong as a separate country to mainland China.

On a list of countries and their capital cities, the Coach and Givenchy shirts also presented Taipei as ""Taipei, Taiwan.""

China considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and Hong Kong is governed under a policy of "" one country, two systems.""

The misstep led to calls for a boycott and Chinese models and celebrity brand ambassadors announced they were severing their professional ties with the labels.

All three companies issued apologies on Chinese social media. Donatella Versace even posted an additional apology to her personal Instagram: ""Never have I wanted to disrespect China's national sovereignty and this is why I wanted to personally apologize for such inaccuracy and for any distress that it might have caused.""

H&M's ""GBV"" range

High street giant H&M was one of the latest to bumble into tone-deaf marketing in November, when it announced a new collaboration with Italian designer Giambattista Valli under the slogan ""I love GBV.""

While the three letters are an abbreviation of the designer's name, outside fashion circles they're commonly used as the initialism for ""gender-based violence.""

Emblazoned on hats, T-shirts, necklaces and even boxer shorts covered in red smiling lips, the tagline angered women's rights activists, who demanded the products be withdrawn.

""This is not an obscure term,"" said Heather Barr , the women's rights division co-director at global advocacy group Human Rights Watch. ""By coming up with this line in the first place it demonstrates the lack of awareness about women's rights.""

""We condemn any type of violence, and as a value driven company, we believe in an inclusive and equal society.""

The line, including the GBV-imprinted products, went on sale as planned.

Bstroy, a rising streetwear label from Atlanta, Georgia, sparked outrage during New York Fashion Week in September for sending four models down the runway in hoodies reading ""Stoneman Douglas,"" ""Sandy Hook,"" ""Virginia Tech"" and ""Columbine"" -- the names of schools and colleges where some of the deadliest mass shootings in the US have occurred.

The garments, designed by Brick Owens and Duey Catorze, featured tears that resembled bullet holes. Social media users spoke out against the designs, which many described as ""disgusting"" and ""tasteless.""

Some commentators identified themselves as survivors or friends and relatives of victims. ""My dead classmates dying should not be a f***ing fashion statement,"" one person wrote under a picture of the Stoneman Douglas hoodie.

Owens later used his personal Instagram to share a handout from the fashion show, which read, ""Sometimes life can be painfully ironic. Like the irony of dying violently in a place you considered to be a safe, controlled environment, like school.""",2019's biggest fashion controversies,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/biggest-fashion-controversies-2019/index.html,2019-12-17T14:04:24+00:00

An old garment depot that survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and provided temporary shelter to victims within its concrete walls, could be partially demolished by local authorities 75 years later.

The former Hiroshima Army Clothing Depot was one of the largest buildings left standing after the US military dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city during World War II, immediately killing more than 70,000 people. The depot was 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) from the blast hypocenter.

More than 90% of the structures in Hiroshima were either destroyed or damaged by the blast and fire, according to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Images taken from the air in the aftermath of the bombing show the totality of the destruction, with only a handful of steel and concrete buildings left standing.

The depot consists of four building, each 15-meters high, built from concrete reinforced with steel bars. The first three units, each almost 5,600 square meters large, are owned by the Hiroshima government. The fourth is slightly smaller at 5,000 square meters and is owned by the national government, according to the Hiroshima Peace Media Center. None have been occupied since 1997.

However, the site's future is now uncertain. The Hiroshima government has proposed demolishing two buildings for public safety reasons, after a recent survey revealed they may be at risk of collapse during major earthquakes.

The study , conducted by local authorities in 2017, found the depot ""had a high risk of collapse"" in the event of a large earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, because it stands on soft ground and consists of few partition walls to support the structure.

In a notice posted last week, local authorities suggested renovating the building closest to the site of the explosion, as it is perceived to have the ""greatest historical value."" However, the notice added that it was unclear whether the building would be safe to occupy even after renovations.

Authorities in Hiroshima said they were prompted to take action after a magnitude 5.3 earthquake last year damaged roads and buildings in Osaka, some 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from the city.

Hiroshima itself also has experienced earthquakes -- a magnitude 6.4 earthquake in 2001 also damaged train systems and phone services.

""The buildings sit in the residential area and considering the risk of collapse, it is the painful choice,"" Taiki Adachi, an asset management officer at the Hiroshima government, told CNN in a phone interview.

Adachi said it would be too expensive to add quake-resistant features for all three buildings, which would come to an estimated 8.4 billion yen ($76.7 million). Instead, the more cost-effective approach would be to demolish two units and keep the most valuable one by reinforcing the walls and roof, which would only cost 800 million yen ($7.3 million).

He said a final decision has not yet been made, and the government is inviting the public to submit feedback on the proposal until February next year.

Keeping history alive

Hiroshima mayor Matsui Kazumi said the buildings were too important to knock down.

""The a-bomb buildings are a silent witness to tell the historical facts of the bombing and the misery of the a-bomb damage. I think they are a valuable asset,"" he told reporters Thursday.

""Hiroshima city understands the need for safety measures and financial resources measures, but we are asking Hiroshima prefectural office to preserve entire buildings as much as possible.""

Iwao Nakanishi was 15 years old and working at the depot when the bomb dropped. Several years ago, he founded the Committee for the Preservation of the Former Army Depot.

Now aged 87, Nakanishi told CNN the buildings contain valuable lessons about the importance of peace.

""It is unacceptable to dismantle them,"" he wrote in an email. ""There is a significant historical value to pass on the lessons of tragedy to future generations.""

The group organizes seminars and site visits where survivors share stories of their experience and spread the message of peace, according to its website.

More than 15,000 residents have also signed an online petition calling on the Hiroshima government to preserve the depot.

Naori Fukuoka, who started the petition, urged the government to utilize the facility as a historical and educational center for the public.

First opened in 1913, the depot was used for producing and storing military uniforms for Japanese soldiers before and during World War II, according to Adachi, the Hiroshima government official.

The building is characteristic of the architectural style of the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), which primarily used bricks and stones as construction materials, according to the Hiroshima government website. Architects used both reinforced concrete and bricks to strengthen its structure, which was uncommon at that time, it said.

After surviving the atomic blast in 1945, the buildings were converted into teaching centers for a higher education institution that later became the education faculty of Hiroshima University. Less than a decade later, in 1956, it was rented to logistics company Nippon Express, before being abandoned in 1997.

Hiroshima considered converting the depot into a cultural museum, but the plan was dropped after surveys showed that the structure may be unsafe in the event of an earthquake.

The Former Army Clothing Depot is one of the largest of 86 existing structures in the city that survived the atomic bomb, according to Hiroshima government.

The most famous structure, the Atomic Bomb Dome, was originally an exhibition hall that was completed in 1915. It is now part of the peace memorial museum in Hiroshima and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

However, not every building that survived the atomic bomb has been preserved. Adachi told CNN that, since 1996, at least 10 privately-owned buildings have been demolished due to aging.

Fukuoka, who started the petition, wrote that the depot's preservation was especially important for Japan to pass on the message of peace to the next generations.

""Many survivors of the atomic bomb have shared their voices here,"" he wrote in the petition. ""Some history can only be preserved when it is kept in its entirety.""",Building left standing after atomic bombing in Hiroshima faces uncertain future,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/hiroshima-building-atomic-bomb-army-depot-intl-hnk/index.html,2019-12-27T03:57:49+00:00
"(CNN) The rafflesia plant is often referred to as a ""monster flower"" for its parasitic properties and repugnant stench. Indonesian wildlife officials might've found the most monstrous flower of them all.

A rafflesia that recently bloomed in a West Sumatran forest is nearly 4 feet in diameter -- that would make it the largest flower ever recorded, according to the Natural Resources and Conservation Center in West Sumatra.

Curiously, it was the same location (and host plant) that produced what was the largest rafflesia ever recorded back in 2017. But this monster flower is 4 inches wider, CNN Indonesia reported.

The plant has no roots or leaves -- it's parasitic. The rafflesia feeds on a host plant to live, drinking its water and nutrients. It's only visible when it bursts through the host plant to reveal its flowers.

The flower's menacing open mouth emits a foul odor similar to rotting meat, earning it the nickname ""corpse flower."" That stench attracts the insects that pollinate it.

"(CNN) — Japan Airlines is giving away 50,000 free round-trip domestic air tickets to international tourists next summer -- but there's a catch.

The giveaway aims to encourage tourists to see less visited parts of Japan, and perhaps take some of the strain off Tokyo between July 1 and September 30 next year as the capital hosts the Olympic Summer Games.

However to win free tickets , travelers must be registered outside of Japan with the flag carrier's Mileage Bank frequent flier program. And you won't know where you are going until a few days after you apply.

The airline will recommend four local destinations to choose from, flying out of Haneda airport in Tokyo, or Osaka's Itami and Kansai airports. Family and friends traveling together can apply as a group of up to four people, and applicants will receive the result within three days of applying.

The Games will be held from July 24 to August 9, 2020, and the subsequent Paralympics finish on September 6. Japan's government expects the ""Olympics effect"" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.

Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to more than 31 million, with about 10 million stopping in Tokyo.

More details about JAL's giveaway will be released in early January, and applications open in late February.

"(CNN) In May 2018, Jared Sklar's wake-up call was waiting for him when he got home from work. He opened the fridge and saw four different pizza boxes from four different restaurants.

""It's pretty embarrassing, but it's the truth,"" Sklar said. ""I just opened the door, and I was just like, 'What are we doing here?' ""

At 285 pounds (129 kilograms), he would sit on the couch and watch TV, with no energy left after conquering the work day. Late-night snacks included popcorn and ice cream. The 27-year-old, who works in sales for Corporate Strategies in Woodland Hills, California, knew something had to change.

And gradually, his clothes felt like they were getting smaller every time he did laundry.

""It gets to that point where you realize that you're getting bigger; the clothes aren't getting smaller,"" he said. ""It was that a-ha moment.""

There were other epiphanies as well. Sklar missed the feeling he got when he used to play sports as a teenager. And there was a history of heart disease in his family.

Together, he and his girlfriend, Samatha MacDonald, decided to make a lifestyle change. They had talked about doing it before, but this time, it stuck. They didn't want to look back 20 years from now and realize they could have made changes to be healthier then.

Jared and his girlfriend, Samantha, during their lifestyle change.

First, they would start going to the gym. But they didn't want to put in the hours of fitness without having the right diet to fuel it and bring up their energy levels.

Other diets sounded too quick for what Sklar wanted to do. He researched intermittent fasting and decided to try it as a sustainable long-term option.

Sklar and MacDonald would eat their meals between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, creating a 16-hour break before eating again. This helped them kick the late-night snacking habit.

""I like time restricted feeding because it allows you to naturally reduce your food intake without counting calories,"" said Lisa Drayer, CNN contributor and registered dietician. ""You eliminate mindless nibbling in the evening and you're also eating in sync with your circadian rhythm so you're front loading your calories, which is more favorable for weight loss.""

They immediately noticed their energy levels start to pick back up as they swapped out pizza for proteins like turkey alongside vegetables, spaghetti squash instead of spaghetti and Greek yogurt bars instead of ice cream.

""When you're eating only during an eight-hour period, you do want to follow good nutritional guidelines, including protein, fiber, enough fluids in your diet as well,"" Drayer said.

Sklar loved eating healthier options, but sometimes had a hard time getting up to go to the gym. For MacDonald, food was a weakness, but she was excited to get up and work out.

""We pushed each in our weak areas,"" MacDonald said. ""We were on different pages initially but pushed each other to be on the same page, and that was a huge help.""

Sklar was also dealing with a chronic hamstring issue, discovered by his doctor after playing flag football and repeatedly pulling his hamstring before the diet. His doctor recommended low-impact exercise, which led Sklar to try indoor cycling. He went to the gym six days a week and pedaled for 45 minutes each day.

The couple tried working out together, but found they slowed each other down. While Sklar was pedaling at the gym, MacDonald found that working out at a high-intensity interval training studio worked better for her.

Sklar and MacDonald also cut back on carbohydrates and replaced a lot of the red meat in his diet with leaner proteins like fish, chicken or ground turkey. They became more conscious of what they were eating overall, making healthier decisions during their eight-hour window each day.

""If you're only eating in these eight hours, it's powerful to choose what you put into your body,"" MacDonald said.

The first month, he had lost 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) while cycling and starting intermittent fasting. It continued for the next six months. Sklar fell in love with cycling. The combination of the music and the calories burned during each session fueled him to continue.

Sklar also found motivation when a close family member had to undergo triple bypass surgery in October.

""When you see that person in the hospital going through that, you just think to yourself that you never want that to happen to you, and you want to prevent it from happening to anybody else that you know,"" Sklar said. ""That was my why. That was a light bulb moment where I knew I had to not only keep this going, lose the weight for me, but I also needed to keep it going for my future self and everybody else around me.""

Over a six to seven-month period, Sklar lost 95 pounds (43 kg). Eventually, one of the instructors pulled Sklar aside and told him he should start teaching an indoor cycling class. He's been teaching for about six months now.

For MacDonald, the changes have been more mental than physical. She lost 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) and loves feeling stronger.

""On a busy day, the hour I'm going to the gym is something I'm giving myself,"" she said.

When you realize you're gaining more muscle and feeling better every day, you can feel yourself getting stronger. That was a big thing. I had never stayed with a workout long enough to feel those changes after months. It makes me feel better every day to slowly see these changes in my body.""

In the morning, Sklar usually has a glass of water after getting up. Lunch is at noon, followed by snacks throughout the day. Before a workout, Sklar enjoys peanut butter and jelly on a rice cake.

""I teach a spin class at 5:30 at night, then I'll have a protein shake and dinner right after, and then I'll maybe have a small snack at 8:00 p.m. I fast for the rest of the night until noon the next day.""

After the initial weight loss, Sklar and MacDonald are allowing for a little more flexibility if they have a special event. But they are committed to being as healthy and fit as possible for the long-term. Intermittent fasting helped them form healthy habits.

Sklar is also training for a triathlon now.

Sklar is much more energetic and confident after his weight loss.

""There's always something in front of me to keep me motivated, to make sure that I don't fall back into my old habits,"" Sklar said.

Sklar is continuing to fast and maintain an active lifestyle. He's more confident , energetic and positive. Sometimes, old friends and coworkers don't recognize him. As his story spreads, Sklar has been able to reconnect with friends or acquaintances and share advice on weight loss and fitness. Sklar didn't realize how much it would mean to him.

""I found that in the long run, I was doing it for my friends, as well, because they found inspiration from it,"" Sklar said.

Being able to make this lifestyle change with his girlfriend has made all the difference, Sklar said.

""It was hugely beneficial to have a support system with me,"" Sklar said. ""There's always going to be those days where you want to cheat and have a pizza, and just having a support system to keep you in check and being responsible for keeping somebody else in check was really important, to me.""",Intermittent fasting and a new passion helped him lose 95 pounds,http://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/26/health/intermittent-fasting-jared-sklar-wellness-live-longer/index.html,2019-08-26T00:00:00
"(CNN) Eating more plants and less meat has been tied to a longer life and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in a new study.

JUST WATCHED The best diets have this in common Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The best diets have this in common 01:21

Sticking to an overall plant-based diet or a diet that includes more plant foods than animal foods could be associated with a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and up to 25% lower risk of early death, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association this week.

The new study adds to ""the substantial body of literature"" suggesting that consuming a plant-based diet is associated with better heart health and lower risk of death, said Casey Rebholz, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and senior author of the study.

""Plant-based diets emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods. Foods derived from plants include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes,"" Rebholz said.

""Animal foods include meat, eggs, dairy, and fish or seafood,"" she said. ""In this study, we did not define plant-based diets on the basis of complete exclusion of animal foods from the diet ... but rather ranked individuals according to their relative frequency of intake of these foods.""","Eat more plants and less meat to live longer and improve heart health, study suggests",http://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-based-diet-heart-disease-study/index.html,2019-08-09T00:00:00
"(CNN) The women range in age from the mid-60s to the early 80s. They love to dance and sing. And twice a week, they come to a gym in Cosmo City, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, to box. They are affectionately known as South Africa's ""boxing grannies,"" and these women are juking and jabbing their way to healthier lives.

""My life was on and off, you know -- sometimes good, sometimes bad,"" said 80-year-old Constance Ngubane, who's been coming in to box since the Boxing Gogos (another name for ""grandmother"" in South Africa) program began in 2014. ""But since I started boxing ... I feel young, like I'm 16. But I'm not 16; I'm 80!""

Constance Ngubane says she feels less like her 80 years and more like age 16 when she's boxing.

For these women, boxing is as much a social activity as it is a physical one, and it is that combination that can boost the benefits of exercise. A study from the Mayo Clinic found that physical activities with more social interaction were associated with a longer lifespan.

""I love to mix with the other grannies,"" Ngubane said. ""They are like family.""

The social aspect of longevity has long fascinated researchers, gaining attention alongside more tangible measurables like diet, exercise and smoking.

"Hanoi (CNN) — When former President Barack Obama traveled to Hanoi in 2016, he famously joined the late Anthony Bourdain for a meal of bun cha, a beloved local specialty made up of bits of marinated, charcoal-grilled pork patties and pork slices in a dipping sauce with rice noodles and herb garnishes.

And then of course there's the world-famous pho. Made with rice noodles, this beef noodle soup is a must-try on the streets of Hanoi -- not to mention readily available overseas.

But there's much more to the city's diverse food scene.

Here are five dishes every Hanoi visitor -- not just global leaders -- should try. (And yes, we know, we've barely scratched the surface. For more amazing meals, check out our list of 40 delicious Vietnamese foods .)

Cha Ca (fish cooked with turmeric and dill)

Hanoians consider cha ca to be so exceptional that there is a road in the capital dedicated to these fried morsels of fish -- Cha Ca Street.

Along the busy road, where spiderwebs of exposed electric wires hang overhead, dozens of specialists compete to sell the best cha ca -- crispy turmeric-marinated fish that's fried tableside in a pan with herbs.

The most famous restaurant on this strip is Ca La Vong -- one of the oldest eateries in Hanoi -- and the first to set up shop on Cha Ca Street, over a century ago.

The dish itself dates back more than 130 years. It was first invented by the local Doan family, who served the special meal to troops during French colonial rule.

Banh Tom (shrimp cake)

Deceptively time-intensive, Hanoi-style banh tom, or shrimp cakes, have just a few main ingredients: freshwater crayfish or shrimp from West Lake, flour and sweet potato.

Instead of grinding the shrimp into a paste (like a fish ball), the fried seafood is usually left whole -- sitting atop the crunchy cakes.

It's typically served with lettuce leaves for wrapping, plus chili, lime juice and fish sauce for dipping.

Banh tom is thought to have become common in the 1930s when small street vendors began congregating along Thanh Nien Street -- a road that separates West Lake (Tây Hồ) and Trúc Bạch Lake.

When the hawkers garnered popularity, the government later combined many of the stalls and opened one big restaurant along the waterfront.

Enter Banh Tom Ho Tay . Today, the restaurant remains a fixture on Thanh Nien Street and still draws a steady stream of friends and families, gathering for slow afternoons full of crispy, savory shrimp cakes, chilled bia hoi (local draft beer), and front-row seats to the lake.

Bun Ca (fish noodle soup)

Fresh and light, bun ca combines fried fishcakes, dill, tomatoes, green onions, and perilla -- a mint-like herb.

A lunchtime staple in Hanoi, you can find bun ca (fish noodle soup) just about anywhere.

But Mark Lowerson, founder of Hanoi Street Tours, points to a vendor west of the Old Quarter called Van, that specializes in the dish.

""This is one of the best in town,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""There are two types of noodles, and then your choice of steamed or fried fish.""

While in other countries, adding salt could be considered an insult to the chef -- Lowerson says that's not the case in Vietnam.

""Here, you are expected to use the condiments on the table,"" he explains.

""Add a little lime, vinegar, chili and herbs to achieve the essential balance of salty, sour, sweet and spicy.""

Bun Rieu Cua (crab noodle soup)

Crabmeat is the star of Bún riêu -- a meat or seafood vermicelli soup. Dan Tham

Bun rieu is a meat or seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color. The broth gets its appearance from tomato paste and annatto oil, made from achiote tree seeds.

Freshwater crabmeat and blanched tomatoes are the soup's star players. Tamarind paste lends sourness to the broth, while airy bits of fried tofu contribute crunch.

Depending on the region, bun rieu might also come topped with beef, pork, snails or fish.

Vermicelli noodles swim in the soup, adding balance to a dish that's both colorful and light. Add to that the requisite plateful of lime wedges, chili and greens -- like banana blossoms and mint -- and you have a perfect meal.

Where to try it? There's an excellent bun rieu street stall run by Ms. Thu, located in Thọ Xương Alley, near St. Joseph's Cathedral.

Ca Phe Trung (egg coffee)

Would you like some eggs with your coffee? In Hanoi, ca phe trung -- or egg coffee -- is a local favorite.

Vietnamese ""egg coffee"" -- or Ca Phe Trung -- is a Hanoi specialty in which a creamy soft, meringue-like egg white foam is perched on dense Vietnamese coffee.

While destinations across the city now serve it, Hanoi's humble Cafe Giang cafe claims to have invented it.

There are hot and cold versions. The former is served as a yellow concoction in a small glass. It's consumed with a spoon and tastes almost like a coffee flavored ice cream -- more like a dessert than coffee.

The hot version comes resting in a small dish of hot water to maintain its temperature.

"(CNN) — As soon as the sun sets in Hanoi , Vietnam , there's only one place to be: the corner of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen streets.

Known as ""Beer Corner"", this famous intersection in the Old Quarter lures travelers and residents alike to socialize over ice-cold bia hoi (light Vietnamese draft beer) atop tiny plastic stools.

A visit to Beer Corner isn't just about enjoying a few brews -- it's also a window into the history of the city.

""If you really want to get up close and personal with the culture of a new city, in particular the culture of the local people, you need to stroll the sidewalks, sit on a stool and have a nice cold beer,"" Brett MacDouall, co-founder of Hanoi Beer Tour , tells CNN Travel.

""And that's what I love about Ta Hien Street.""

Bonding over beer

It's on Ta Hien Street where MacDouall and co-founder Tan Vu met for the first time in 2005.

While chatting over beer, the two men discovered their fathers both fought in the Vietnam War, albeit on opposing sides.

""So here were two boys, both born in 1974 who grew up in the 1980s,"" says MacDouall. ""I suppose you could say, ideologically, we were very opposed.""

""But the first time we sat down over a cold beer and spoke to one another, we realized that our family values were very similar and have become the best of friends.""

Today, the two men aren't just best buds -- they're also business partners, traipsing around the city with travelers to explore and share the city's stories of beer.

Bia hoi basics

The first brewery in Hanoi opened in the 1890s, when the French controlled the city.

""The French brought the beer drinking culture to Vietnam,"" says MacDouall. ""Before that, [people drank] rice wine.""

After the Hanoi beer brewing factory was set up, beer culture caught on quickly.

Today, Vietnam is one Asia's biggest beer-drinking nations, consuming 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.

""It evolved through workers [who enjoyed beer] after a hard day's work,"" says MacDouall. ""It was also curiosity -- people wanted to see what Westerners were drinking.""

At the time, however, the beer was expensive, marketed to the city's upper crust.

It wasn't until the late 1950s that bia hoi was introduced as an affordable options for everyday citizens. A brewery opened on Ta Hien Street, selling the fresh lager at just a few cents a mug.

This local staple is a light and refreshing lager, with an alcohol content of less than 3%.

The idea? You can drink it for long sessions to cool off after working all day in Hanoi's sweltering temperatures.

""Some will actually say it is 'instant beer' like instant noodles, since it is made quickly and sold quickly,"" explains MacDouall.

""The alcohol content is low and that was because people wanted to consume it rapidly.""

Over the years, countless bars and restaurants have populated Ta Hien Street, bring with them swathes of tiny stools and metal tables that flank both sides of the sidewalk.

All new brews

Still today, bia hoi is relatively affordable when compared with international labels. A glass of the light lager could set you back anywhere from 15 to 40 US cents.

But that's slowly changing.

""For local owners, selling bia hoi doesn't create enough money to sustain the business,"" says MacDouall.

""So they would rather sell bottled beer and focus on food. But if you still want bia hoi, this is where you come and get it.""

And if you want something other than lager?

"(CNN) — Hanoi might be famous for its impenetrable walls of Vespas, but the city isn't quite as chaotic as it's chalked up to be.

Wandering about the capital of Vietnam , travelers expecting a wild urban adventure might be pleasantly surprised to also find quiet, leafy streets and hidden coffee shops.

One of the most charming aspects of the city is the plethora of restored neoclassical and Gothic architecture -- a holdover from the city's stint as a French colony from 1883 to 1954.

It's easy to romanticize the era, given the beautiful remains, but it's worth remembering that this was a difficult time for Hanoi, afflicted with opium addictions and oppression.

Despite the turbulent history, the resulting architecture is worth admiring. One way to experience it is with a stay at one of the city's many boutique hotels.

Located in Hanoi's Old Quarter -- a network of 36 streets, organized by trade -- these quaint addresses combine modern amenities with historic atmosphere for an authentic base while exploring the city.

Here are eight of the best when you travel here:

1. Hotel de l'Opera

Formerly the residence of the French Governor of Tonkin (the historic name of northern Vietnam), the hotel is conveniently located right around the corner from the Hanoi Opera house and the neo-Gothic St. Joseph's Cathedral.

Inside, guests will find a few destination restaurants, including the French Le Beaulieu and the romantic Bamboo Bar in the lush courtyard, by the pool.

Likewise, the elegant rooms also add to the Indo-French atmosphere with vintage furniture, silk tapestries, green shutters and original wrought-iron details.

Since opening in 1901, the hotel has been the go-to home base for celebrities, politicians and literary figures alike, having welcomed the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Graham Greene.

(CNN) — There's no shortage of reasons to fall in love with Japan

Whether you're hunting down top eats in Tokyo and Osaka or basking in the country's stunning landscapes , it's impossible to take it all in in one visit. But you'll certainly have a good time trying.

We've built the ultimate cheat sheet of top Japan experiences to help you plan your next visit. Also, be sure to click through the gallery on the top of this story of beautiful Japan destinations for more travel inspo.

THE GREAT OUTDOORS

Though Japan might be most famous for its dazzlingly modern cities, you'll want to spend at least a few days exploring its stunning natural offerings. This is a nation that truly has it all, from rocky mountain peaks to white-sand beaches.

Here are few Japan experiences that will allow for both relaxation and adventure.

Winter sports

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

Nagano, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, has long been a snowy escape for global travelers. But in recent years, Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido has become another leading destination for powder hunters thanks to its fresh, quality snow and amazing food scene.

Down on the island of Honshu, meanwhile, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture offers skiing, onsen (more on that later) and ""snow monsters.""

For something completely different, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route , dubbed the ""Roof of Japan,"" offers travelers a chance to drive down a highway framed by massive walls of snow that tower as high as 17 meters over the road.

Beach hopping

It's easy to see why this stunning Iwate prefecture beach was named ""Jodogahama,"" or Pure Land. JNTO

Being an island nation, Japan's beach offerings are just as impressive as its skyscrapers and bullet trains.

In the north of Japan's main island, Jodogahama Beach (Pure Land in English) is a tranquil hidden beach with crystal-clear water and stark white rocks.

If you prefer softer (and darker) sand, Ibusuki Beach is your dream destination. The subtropical beach is famed for a unique activity -- sand bathing, or suna-mushi.

For island hoppers, you can check out a series of 260 tiny pine tree-covered islands in Matsushima.

Onsen soaking

For anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm. It's the rule.

The word ""onsen"" refers to Japan's natural hot springs but it also can represent facilities like spas and inns that pipe the waters into their own bathing areas.

Though thousands of onsen exist throughout the country, Beppu is Japan's hot spring capital -- and for good reason. It's home to more than 2,500 hot springs and is the world's second-largest source of thermal spring water.

For travelers with ink, however, stripping down at a Japanese onsen can get tricky as many ban tattoos, which have been associated with yakuza gangs.

Fortunately, there's Tattoo-Friendly , a website featuring properties that allow ink. Users can narrow down the search by choosing the type of facility they want to visit -- gym, pool, hotel-and-ryokan (inn) or sento (public baths).

Each listed property includes a brief description of the place and its amenities, as well its specific policies on tattoos.

Hanami

For just a few weeks every spring, Japan celebrates an annual ritual known as hanami: stopping to view and appreciate the beautiful spring blossoms.

It's so popular the Japan Weather Association's annual sakura (cherry blossom) forecast is broadcast live on TV, while the Japan National Tourism Organization has a regularly updated timetable of cherry blossoms predictions on their website.

Hiking

Being a mountainous nation, trekking is an extremely popular Japan activity.

For a spiritual journey, try Kumano Kodo , a multiday pilgrimage across Wakayama prefecture -- fueled by great food, cute rural villages and rich culture along the way.

More than a thousand years ago, imperial leaders and aristocrats made their way to the main Kumano Kodo shrines through a network of hikes across the island. At the end of the hike we recommend spending the night at a temple in the mountaintop town of Koyasan , the center of Shingon Buddhism.

Here, ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops.

The enchanting Yakushima forest (the setting for Hayao Miyazaki's epic film Princess Mononoke) on Kyushu island and the Sagano bamboo forest on the outskirts of Kyoto are other family-friendly places to enjoy a quiet walk in Japan.

TRADITION

Japan excels at striking the right balance between tradition and modernity, leading the way in technological advances while also embracing its past, whether it's architecture, art, fashion, food or sports.

Here are a few experiences that will give you a taste for Japan's traditional side.

Stay in a ryokan

Looking for that classic Japanese inn experience, complete with tatami floors, onsen and sliding doors?

Staying in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese guesthouse, is the way to go. Catering to all budgets, they can be found throughout Japan -- most commonly in the countryside outside of urban centers.

Guests are encouraged to wear yukata (house kimonos) and socks, while traditional Japanese meals are prepared in-house.

Tea ceremonies

CNN's Paula Newton travels to Fukuoka and the surrounding tea-rich lands to experience the traditional winter tea ceremony.

The Japanese tea ceremony, or chado , is a traditional way of preparing and serving matcha (top quality green tea).

To make it, green tea leaves, grown in the shade, are dried and ground into a fine powder. This allows the tea to retain its nutrients. During the ceremony, which focuses on the rituals and mental states achieved in the process, the powder is whisked with hot water in a small bowl until a slight foam appears.

The top place to experience Japan's matcha tea ceremony -- or just enjoy a few cups of the precious drink -- is Kyoto. There are plenty of tea making classes and demonstrations available in English and other languages.

Kimonos

Japan's most beautiful traditional attire, kimonos are undeniably an expensive souvenir to bring home. One reason for their hefty price tag is the painstakingly detailed process that goes into making them.

Another reputable kimono-making company is Okaju in Kyoto, founded in 1855 and now helmed by the fourth generation Shigeo Okajima.

If you'd simply like to don one during your Japan visit, there are a number of rental companies throughout Kyoto.

Prefer to appreciate these beautiful garments from afar? Kyoto's Gion district is where travelers can view graceful geishas, traditional Japanese entertainers, walking down the street in their kimonos.

Sumo watching

Sumo is as ancient as it is quintessentially Japanese. Historians agree that the sport dates back at least 2,000 years, and in its current form has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period.

But scoring a seat at one of Japan's six major sumo tournaments per year might as tough as getting into the ring and wrestling yourself, though with a little advance planning you can make it happen. Tickets are available through Japan's official sumo website

There are other ways to get close to a sumo wrestler.

When they're not competing, sumo wrestlers train year round in designated sumo stables, or beya.

These stables, which are mostly based in Tokyo's Ryogoku neighborhood, are where the city's wrestlers live, eat, sleep and practice on a near daily basis. In recent years, it's become more common for foreigners to visit the morning practice, which begins at about 5 a.m. and lasts three to four hours.

CUISINE

Japan is a culinary wonderland thanks to its unique heritage, a national obsession with food and an almost religious embrace of freshness and perfect production.

Here are a few of the country's must-try dining experiences. Been there, ate that? For a deeper dive into the country's culinary wonders, check out our list of 25 top Japanese dishes

Sushi

l e v a r t

Chances are, sushi is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think ""Japanese food.""

More than just a slice of fish over vinegar rice -- that is only one type, called nigiri -- mastering the art of sushi can easily take a lifetime. Luckily, there's Sushi University , where travelers can learn to distinguish nigiri from nori-maki.

Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.

Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.

If you're up for a splurge, Sushisho Masa (106-0031 Tokyo, Minato City,Nishiazabu, 4 Chome−1−15) in Tokyo's Roppongi neighborhood is nothing short of perfection.

And then of course there's Sukiyabashi Jiro , the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro earned global fame following the 2012 documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi.""

Kobe beef

Known for its pervasive marbling and melt-on-your-tongue texture, Kobe beef is one of Japan's most prized meats.

A type of Wagyu beef named after the region in which the cattle are raised, Kobe is relatively rare -- only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade.

This has caused a fair bit of confusion but here's an easy way to remember it. Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline.

The Kansai region, where Osaka is based, produces the three ""king"" varieties of Wagyu: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty.

Soba

Want a seat at Kyourakutei? You'll have to wait in line. CNN meets up with the man behind this popular Michelin-starred Tokyo soba restaurant.

Soba, or Japanese buckwheat noodles, are usually served cold with dipping sauce (called zaru soba) or served hot in dashi broth.

Triumphing over them all is te-uchi, which means ""handmade,"" soba in Japanese. The hand-kneaded and cut soba offers the best firmness and, hence, is more much tastier than the mass-produced variety.

For a truly unique soba experience, head to Iwate, a prefecture in Japan's northeast where you can enjoy a 400-year-old all-you-can-eat noodle tradition called "" wanko soba .""

One wanko soba restaurant claims a diner ate 570 bowls in one sitting.

Yakitori

One of the best reasons to visit a pub in Japan? Yakitori, Japanese style chicken skewers. ©JNTO

A yakitori restaurant is where you can sample every part of the chicken -- from chicken breast to skins to gizzards -- all presented on skewers, Japanese style.

Tokyo's Torikado is one of the best places to enjoy them. A high-end omakase yakitori restaurant, Torikado's diners will leave it up to the chef to decide what they eat.

Another popular way to chow down a few chicken skewers is with a beer at an izakaya, or casual Japanese pub. Here's our selection of the best (and affordable) izakaya in Tokyo

Kaiseki

Kaiseki meals were originally intended to be enjoyed before a tea ceremony.

Japan travelers researching a trip to Kyoto will inevitably come across the word ""kaiseki.""

To the outsider, it appears to simply be a multicourse Japanese dinner made up of beautifully plated dishes. But there's so much more to this meticulously prepared, exquisitely served and, usually, very expensive meal.

To practitioners of this haute cuisine, kaiseki is the embodiment of ""omotenashi,"" which means wholehearted hospitality.

Ramen

Nothing's more comforting than slurping back a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day.

There are four basic styles of the world-famous soup-based dish: Shoyu (soy sauce seasoning); shio (a light soy sauce version of shoryu); miso (made with fermented soy beans); and tonkotsu (a creamy-white pork bone broth).

CNN Travel asked Brian Mac, founder of the blog Ramen Adventures , to share some of his favorite ramen varieties in Tokyo and beyond, which include Hokkaido's miso ramen, Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen and all kinds of shoyu variations. Read more about them here

Sake

A one-minute tour of Japan's northern Tohoku region, which produces some of the country's best bottles of sake.

Japanese rice wine, sake has a long-standing history dating back to the third century.

It's produced all over the country -- and many brewers are open to tours -- but Japan's Tohoku region in the northeast is where you'll find some of the best bottles.

Part of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku.

For visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tastings -- but you will need to book in advance via their websites.",16 Japan experiences every traveler needs to enjoy,http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/japan-top-experiences/index.html,2019-10-23T01:54:57+00:00
"(CNN) — Think sitting in an inflated raft while rushing down white-water rapids is hardcore? You haven't tried the wildest rafting experience in Japan

Kitayama village , located about three hours from Osaka in Wakayama prefecture, offers tourists a chance to discover what it's like to sail down the swift currents of Kitayama River on traditional logging rafts.

Here's the kicker -- you're not even seated.

For the whole time, riders stand in a line on the sturdy, long wooden rafts, clutching only the metal/wooden handles that rise from the base of the rafts.

As terrifying as it looks to be a rider, the true cowboys on this journey are the guides.

Wooden oars in hand, they pilot the rafts down the river rapids while standing, wearing boots, a hat... and no life jacket.

The adventure sport was inspired by Japan's traditional lumber industry, in which felled wood was assembled into rafts then sent down the river -- a transport method used for more than 600 years. In the late 1970s, it was introduced to tourists.

Game? The rafting season lasts from May to September, with reservations accepted from April 1. Days and times vary depending on month. Minimum age to join is 10 years old.

(CNN) — Let's face the facts. Japan is a popular place.

With close to 30 million international travelers heading there in 2018, tourists visiting traditional hotspots such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka during peak travel periods -- say, cherry blossom season in the spring -- will find themselves battling overwhelming crowds.

But the northern region of Tohoku remains surprisingly undertraveled in comparison, making it a fantastic destination any time of year.

Located at the tip of Japan's main island of Honshu, Tohoku is made up of six prefectures: Aomori, Akita, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi and Yamagata, all of which are filled with dramatic landscapes, historical attractions and culinary delights.

Here's a sample of some of the top Tohoku experiences on offer. For even more ideas, click through the above gallery.

Zao Onsen, where snow monsters roar

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

The Tohoku region gets some of the world's biggest dumps of snowfall each winter, making it a great alternative to traditional ski resort destinations such as the wildly popular Hokkaido to the north.

One of the most foreigner-friendly destinations in the area, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture is well-equipped to welcome powder hunters looking for some time on the slopes.

But the real reason to visit is to see Japan's famed snow monsters -- or ""juhyo"" in Japanese.

Every winter, as Siberian winds rush though the Zao Mountain Range, trees begin to collect thick, juicy layers of snow and ice. The trees freeze into fascinating humanesque forms.

To access the snow monsters, head for the Zao Onsen Ski Resort , which is spread over several peaks.

It's a mid-sized facility that's ideal for beginner and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Zao's longest downhill course is a 10-kilometer stretch that starts up at the snow monster observation area.

l e v a r t

The best time to see the monsters is late January to early March, before the spring warmth seeps in.

If you can't make it in winter, there's still plenty to see. For instance, the gorgeous Okama Crater Lake is surrounded by the three peaks of Tohoku's Zao mountain range.

It was named after ""kama,"" a traditional iron pot that shares its shape, and can be visited in the summer months.

Akita, birthplace of Japan's most beloved dog breed

Employed as everything from mascots and resort greeters to train station masters, Japan's adorable Akita Inu dogs -- which originally come from Tohoku's Akita prefecture -- have been charming the nation for decades.

The most famous Akita is Hachito, who was immortalized in film and has his own statue In Shibuya, Tokyo.

According to the legend, Hachito visited Shibuya station every single evening for a year to greet his caretaker after work. Sadly, one day his human friend died while on the job and did not return. Nevertheless, Hachito continued to visit the same spot every day for nine years.

How's that for loyalty?

More recently, a band of Akita dogs was employed by a regional tourism body to create what might just be the strangest pop music video we've ever seen. (Check it out below.)

Want to meet some of these canine cuties in person? Head for Odate, Akita's capital.

The Akita Dog Visitor Center at Odate Station is home to two honorary station masters, while the Akita Dog Museum offers a look at the history of these cute canines.

Wanko soba: An all-you-can-eat noodle binge

At the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, brave eaters can eat as many bowls of soba as they want for 3,240 yen (or $31.80). It's also known as Japan's Wanko Soba Noodle Challenge.

Only for the hungry, the wanko soba challenge is an all-you-can-eat buckwheat noodle binge unique to Japan's Iwate prefecture.

Here's how it goes: A server brings tiny bowls of noodles, laying them down one after another as quick as you can slurp them back.

As soon as you empty a bowl, she'll swoop in to fill it with another mouthful, yelling ""hai dan dan!""

There's only one way to ebb the noodle flow -- put a lid your wanko (bowl).

Related content The ultimate all-you-can-eat noodle binge

There are a few rules involved.

For starters, you have to eat continuously. You can't take a break and digest your noodles then come back to the table for more.

We recommend trying it at the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, Iwate's capital.

There are four Morioka locations but the Ekimae branch is just a two-minute walk from the train station and has English-language menus.

Matsushima: Japan's most scenic views

l e v a r t

Matsushima is one of the fabled ""Nihon Sankei"" -- or ""Three Views of Japan.""

More than 260 tiny, pine tree-covered islands dot the waters of Matsushima Bay, creating a scene that's been the muse of dozens of Japanese poets and artists through the ages.

To truly appreciate Matsushima's beauty, head straight for the shore near the Matsushima Kaigan train station. Several islands are connected to the mainland by photo-worthy red bridges, such as the exquisite Fukuurabashi Bridge, which leads to Fukuurajima Island.

Home to more than 300 species of flowers, plants and trees, the island's network of walking paths leads to several viewpoints.

Nearby, the beautiful Godaido Temple, founded in 807, sits on another small island that's also connected to the mainland via a series of red bridges.

To explore further afield, cruises depart from Matsushima Pier every hour. The 50-minute tour takes travelers around the bay, passing islands and oyster farms.

Doesn't hurt that the food's amazing in Matsushima, too.

""Seafood in the Matsushima area is considered of the highest quality because the seafood harvested in the area benefits from the nutrient-rich water and plankton found off its coast,"" says award-winning author Hiroko Shimbo, an expert on Japanese cuisine who organizes culinary tours through the country.

""In addition to oysters there are such local specialties as salmon, skipjack tuna (katsuo), Pacific pike (sanma), northern clam (hokkigai), asari clams, abalone (awabi), scallops (hotategai) and the best-quality wakame (sea vegetable) -- don't call it seaweed!""

The small but substantial Matsushima Fish Market is a fine place to kick off a culinary tour of the town.

Vendors here serve everything from ramen and sushi to oyster croquette burgers.

Sendai: Japan's beef tongue capital

l e v a r t

Though gyutan -- beef tongue -- is available at yakiniku restaurants all over Japan, Sendai is where you'll find the highest concentration of eateries solely dedicated to grilling up these juicy strips of meat.

The original beef tongue restaurant is Aji Tasuke, founded in 1948 by a man named Keishiro Sano.

He left Sendai to apprentice in Tokyo around 1935. It was there that he met a French chef, who he saw cooking up a beef tongue stew. Inspired, he decided to prepare it differently to suit Japanese tastes.

After World War II ended, he returned north and opened a restaurant in Sendai. Due to food shortages, he began serving his take on beef tongue, along with tail soup.

Seven decades on, Sano's photo still hangs on the wall and the restaurant is still going strong, now run by his eldest son.

And it's got competition. Nowadays you can't turn a corner in the center of this city of one million people without seeing a restaurant advertising gyutan -- ""gyu"" is Japanese for cow, while the ""tan"" refers to the English word for tongue.

Yamadera, one of Japan's most beautiful temples

Those willing to climb the site's 1,015 stairs are rewarded with great views — and maybe even a bit of luck.

You're going to have to work a bit to enjoy this one.

The stunning Yamadera Risshakuji Temple complex is located on Mount Hoju-san in Japan's Yamagata prefecture. But here's the kicker: You have to walk up 1,015 stairs to reach it.

Though its official name is Risshakuji, locals refer to it simply as Yamadera -- which means ""mountain temple.""

The temple complex, founded in AD 860 to oversee the northern Tohoku region's Tendai Buddhism sect, is actually made up of more than a dozen sites of religious importance, such as shrines, gates and monuments.

Climbing the staircase is intended to be a meditative experience and is said to bring good luck to those who reach the top.

Like many of Japan's attractions, this one is beautiful no matter the season but we recommend going in fall or winter, when the views of the Yamagata countryside are particularly spectacular.

Getting there is easy. Yamadera Station is about a 40-minute train ride from Tohoku's biggest city, Sendai, in neighboring Miyagi prefecture.

When it comes to traditional arts, Tohoku is where you'll find some of the country's most impressive ancient crafts -- still being produced by skilled artists to this day.

There's magewappa, or bent woodware, a traditional craft that originated in Akita and is used to make bento boxes, steamers and other items.

Meanwhile artisans in Aizu, Fukushima prefecture's westernmost region, have been making erosoku -- large colored candles -- by hand for hundreds of years.

"Written by Stella Ko, CNN Macao

Many of Asia's biggest cities owe their skylines to long bamboo poles that allow construction workers to climb to great heights.

This type of scaffolding has been used for centuries in places like Macao, where two architects are now trying to change local perceptions by transforming the poles into works of art.

Rita Machado and João Ó, founders of the design studio Impromptu Projects, have teamed up with local bamboo masters, who are known as ""spiders"" for their deft and dangerous work on the web-like structures.

""We formed a kind of friendship where the masters share their knowledge and we show their work,"" Machado says.

Early uses of bamboo

Bamboo has long been used for construction in parts of Asia where it grows plentifully and rivals steel in strength and durability. It grows incredibly quickly -- and up to 8 meters (26 feet) high -- making it a sustainable building material that has endured for centuries.

The poles were once used to build huts and small-scale projects, though bamboo grids stretching hundreds of meters into the air alongside modern high-rises are now a common sight.

The merging of old and new is a central theme in Ó and Machado's bamboo projects. And Macao, with its blend of Portuguese and Chinese history, offers a rich palate for them to work with.

Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works

The first Portuguese settlers arrived in Macao in the 1500s and it soon became an important hub along Portugal's Asian trading route. Portuguese influences can be seen in the European architecture and the distinctive blue and white tiles that the merchants imported on their ships. Chinese influences are also apparent, especially in the A-Ma Temple, built in 1488, one of the city's oldest buildings.

In 2005, the city's historical center was added to the World Heritage List as a place of outstanding universal value -- an accolade it owes, in part, to bamboo.

Every year, residents build a bamboo-shed theater outside the A-Ma Temple to pray for the safety of fishermen at sea. It's a tradition that has endured in this port city for more than 100 years -- one that captured the attention of the two architects, who live next door.

""This kind of annual renewal of ancestral technology is amazing,"" says Machado. ""We re-adapted this knowledge that already existed in the city and created a new form of expressing ourselves.""

Beyond simply expressing themselves, the designers want to draw attention to a skill that is in danger of dying out.

Macao's 'spiders'

Macao's humid summers and tightly-packed buildings produce challenging conditions for the territory's remaining bamboo scaffolders.

Chio Seng Wai has been in the industry for nearly 50 years. In that time he has erected hundreds of skeleton frames with his bare hands, instinctively judging the correct length of the bamboo poles and how they should be assembled. Over the years, he's worked on commemorative arches, swimming sheds and buildings that stretch up dozens of stories.

His knowledge can only be passed down through intensive physical training, but in recent years there have been few candidates willing to learn.

""Young people are not interested in this field because it is dangerous, working in high elevation above the ground, and it is hard labor under the strong sun,"" says Chio. ""We are old and have to retire, but we want to take our industry global to spread our culture and crafts.""

There are fewer than 50 bamboo experts left in Macao, Chio says. This statistic alarmed the Impromptu Projects team, which has closely observed the scaffolders as they work.

""The width of the grid in the scaffolding is the length of their arm and the height is their legs, so they can interlock it and use their hands freely,"" explains Ó.

""Their way of interlocking and grabbing the bamboo poles and breathing follow certain forces in their environment,"" he continues. ""We came to understand that their positions on the bamboo structure were very close to tai chi movements.""

Reviving a dying profession

The bamboo designs may take shape in the architects' studio, but the real work happens outside. Using 3D models, the bamboo artisans set about recreating their vision, lifting and tying each pole by hand.

Workers climb onto slender poles woven into web-like walls and platforms to construct the city's buildings. Credit: Impromptu Projects

""Bamboo used in our structure is always the second, third, or the fourth life of the scaffolding used previously, and the material again returns back to other construction sites,"" Machado explains.

The architects say it is important to show their work to the local community, so residents appreciate bamboo scaffolding as art, not just a tool.

Ó and Machado believe that having scaffolding workers engage in the art scene will help keep the tradition -- and an endangered profession -- alive.

""We see the craftsmen as artisans, not just the low-ranking construction industry workers,"" says Ó. ""This idea of renewal of the technology and ancestral knowledge passed verbally or visually -- it's a continuation of the local identity.

""We feel responsible to extend this knowledge to the next generation.""",Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/bamboo-scaffolding-artisans-macao/index.html,2019-09-06T08:17:34+00:00

Hundreds of the 65-year-old's signs can be seen all over Macao, a special administrative region that was handed back to China in 1999 after centuries of Portuguese rule.

They're written in traditional Chinese characters -- which are more complicated and contain more strokes -- as opposed to the simplified Chinese characters that were adopted by the mainland in the 1950s, when Macao was still a European colony.

Adorning the entrance to Lam's workshop-cum-abode are bright red letters, wishing good fortune in the Year of the Pig. As he works, wall of white paper scrolls covered with Chinese poems and aphorisms flutter in the breeze.

The machine hums and slices. Lam shifts the sheet this way and that.

After a few minutes of intense focus, Lam frees a word from an acrylic sheet. He holds it up to light, inspects the grooves.

""門."" Chinese for ""gate.""

While this particularly character is usually written as two nonadjacent radicals that look like saloon doors from a Western movie, Lam's 門 comes out in one piece, with the stylized flourishes of a brushstroke.

Lam says he was noticed for his penmanship from an early age.

""I've always been interested in Chinese characters,"" Lam says. ""When I was a student, other classmates would ask me to write characters for them, because they liked the look of my handwriting. When I got older, people told me that I should open my own business.""

Lam's signs advertise doctors' offices and grocery stores, real estate agencies and apartment buildings.

But Lam says business has been slow lately, because shopkeepers across Macao are opting for cheaper, digitally-produced signs over his traditional ones.

""In the digital age, many people don't need you to write for them,"" Lam says. ""I've received fewer customers.""

But technology hasn't spelled total doom for Lam's typography business. In 2014, a chance meeting led Lam to local typeface designer, Benny Tang Pou I, a long-time fan of his work. Tang's award-winning work includes fonts that emulate birds in flight and the cobblestoned streets of Macao.

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Together, the two decided to digitize Lam's handwriting, with every stroke in every character replicated on Tang's computer and immortalized as a typeface.

""I would say that handwritten signs, like Mr. Lam's, convey more emotion and humanness,"" the 38-year-old says. ""A digitally-produced sign feels lifeless.""

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Credit: Dan Tham/CNN

Tang scans the characters onto his computer and then adjusts the shape of the strokes to create more uniformity. So far, he's digitized around 300 of Lam's Chinese characters, a process that took six months. He aims to convert up to 13,000 by the end of the project, which could take more than five years.

On a stroll near the Ruins of St. Paul's, Lam and Tang point out the signage that carries Lam's trademark style. Pausing in front of a barber shop, the two are greeted by the storeowner. They explain that Lam had written his storefront sign. The three men step back and admire his handiwork.

For Tang, these kinds of traditional signs do more than convey information to passersby. They can help to define a city's aesthetic and cultural identity.

""Certain things here (in Macao) are slowly fading away,"" Tang says, ""Like Mr. Lam's signs. If we don't take action to preserve his font now, there might not be an opportunity in the future.""",Preserving Macao's handmade signs in the digital age,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/artisans-macao-typography-signs/index.html,2019-11-23T00:43:04+00:00
"Macao (CNN) — You can smell it before you see it. The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's Café e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's Café e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

It's this same recipe, three decades later, that continues to be sold across Macao.

Today, hundreds of tourists and locals alike line up at her cafe for a bite of this now famous pastry.

Wong's cafe alone can make up to 10,000 tarts a day -- all of which are bound to sell out.

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

'Like the tart, I never change'

Visitors to Margaret's Café e Nata will usually find her in the kitchen or behind the till. CNN

Every single dish sold by the bakery is graced with Wong's magic touch. In addition to egg tarts, other items on the menu include brownies, cakes and croissants. There's also a salad and sandwich bar.

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

"Written by Stella Ko, CNN Macao

Many of Asia's biggest cities owe their skylines to long bamboo poles that allow construction workers to climb to great heights.

This type of scaffolding has been used for centuries in places like Macao, where two architects are now trying to change local perceptions by transforming the poles into works of art.

Rita Machado and João Ó, founders of the design studio Impromptu Projects, have teamed up with local bamboo masters, who are known as ""spiders"" for their deft and dangerous work on the web-like structures.

""We formed a kind of friendship where the masters share their knowledge and we show their work,"" Machado says.

Early uses of bamboo

Bamboo has long been used for construction in parts of Asia where it grows plentifully and rivals steel in strength and durability. It grows incredibly quickly -- and up to 8 meters (26 feet) high -- making it a sustainable building material that has endured for centuries.

The poles were once used to build huts and small-scale projects, though bamboo grids stretching hundreds of meters into the air alongside modern high-rises are now a common sight.

The merging of old and new is a central theme in Ó and Machado's bamboo projects. And Macao, with its blend of Portuguese and Chinese history, offers a rich palate for them to work with.

Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works

The first Portuguese settlers arrived in Macao in the 1500s and it soon became an important hub along Portugal's Asian trading route. Portuguese influences can be seen in the European architecture and the distinctive blue and white tiles that the merchants imported on their ships. Chinese influences are also apparent, especially in the A-Ma Temple, built in 1488, one of the city's oldest buildings.

In 2005, the city's historical center was added to the World Heritage List as a place of outstanding universal value -- an accolade it owes, in part, to bamboo.

Every year, residents build a bamboo-shed theater outside the A-Ma Temple to pray for the safety of fishermen at sea. It's a tradition that has endured in this port city for more than 100 years -- one that captured the attention of the two architects, who live next door.

""This kind of annual renewal of ancestral technology is amazing,"" says Machado. ""We re-adapted this knowledge that already existed in the city and created a new form of expressing ourselves.""

Beyond simply expressing themselves, the designers want to draw attention to a skill that is in danger of dying out.

Macao's 'spiders'

Macao's humid summers and tightly-packed buildings produce challenging conditions for the territory's remaining bamboo scaffolders.

Chio Seng Wai has been in the industry for nearly 50 years. In that time he has erected hundreds of skeleton frames with his bare hands, instinctively judging the correct length of the bamboo poles and how they should be assembled. Over the years, he's worked on commemorative arches, swimming sheds and buildings that stretch up dozens of stories.

His knowledge can only be passed down through intensive physical training, but in recent years there have been few candidates willing to learn.

""Young people are not interested in this field because it is dangerous, working in high elevation above the ground, and it is hard labor under the strong sun,"" says Chio. ""We are old and have to retire, but we want to take our industry global to spread our culture and crafts.""

There are fewer than 50 bamboo experts left in Macao, Chio says. This statistic alarmed the Impromptu Projects team, which has closely observed the scaffolders as they work.

""The width of the grid in the scaffolding is the length of their arm and the height is their legs, so they can interlock it and use their hands freely,"" explains Ó.

""Their way of interlocking and grabbing the bamboo poles and breathing follow certain forces in their environment,"" he continues. ""We came to understand that their positions on the bamboo structure were very close to tai chi movements.""

Reviving a dying profession

The bamboo designs may take shape in the architects' studio, but the real work happens outside. Using 3D models, the bamboo artisans set about recreating their vision, lifting and tying each pole by hand.

""Bamboo used in our structure is always the second, third, or the fourth life of the scaffolding used previously, and the material again returns back to other construction sites,"" Machado explains.

The architects say it is important to show their work to the local community, so residents appreciate bamboo scaffolding as art, not just a tool.

Ó and Machado believe that having scaffolding workers engage in the art scene will help keep the tradition -- and an endangered profession -- alive.

""We see the craftsmen as artisans, not just the low-ranking construction industry workers,"" says Ó. ""This idea of renewal of the technology and ancestral knowledge passed verbally or visually -- it's a continuation of the local identity.

""We feel responsible to extend this knowledge to the next generation.""",Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/bamboo-scaffolding-artisans-macao/index.html,2019-09-06T08:17:34+00:00
"Zahra Jamshed , CNN Macao Written by

Master shipbuilder Tam Kam Chun is on a mission. Every day, the 71-year-old spends hours at an abandoned Macao shipyard, hunched over a table, hard at work. With only stray dogs for company and a single electric fan to keep him cool, he meticulously hand-crafts the sort of fishing boats that have been made here for generations.

But none of his creations will ever set sail. In fact, Tam's boats are miniatures designed to preserve the city's disappearing heritage.

""There is so much history in the fishing and shipbuilding industries,"" he says. ""I make model boats to show the craftsmanship and the building process (and) to educate people.""

For centuries, the shipping industry was at the heart of life in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that was transformed from a small fishing village to a major port. In recent years, however, casinos have taken over as the city's main source of income.

Historic ship replicas nod to Macao's maritime past

And with mainland China able to produce state-of-the-art metal fishing vessels, quicker and at lower costs, demand for traditional wooden boats all but disappeared.

No new boats have been made here since 2006. Not full-sized ones, at least.

Three years ago, Tam -- who is considered a ""sifu,"" or master, of his craft -- was commissioned by a local temple to recreate a so-called ""junk"" boat in miniature form. He has since produced more than a dozen replicas of the very boats he spent his career making.

""We're not just building models,"" he said. ""It's about craftsmanship, shipbuilding and history.""

Turning the tide

Tam's makeshift studio lies in an abandoned shipyard in Macao's Lai Chi Vun village. The space, which is crumbling at its edges having endured several of the region's worst tropical storms, is a shadow of its former self.

But for Tam, working in the very places he spent his youth is about more than finding a convenient studio -- it allows him to reminisce about the industry's boom era.

Shipbuilding in Macao hit its peak in the 1950s, when there were almost 30 shipyards across the region. By the 1980s however, the industry was in steep decline. Today, the wooden junks that once dotted the shores of Macao, and neighboring Hong Kong, have ceased to exist, save for a handful of tourist boats.

""We thought it would go on for (a) long (time), we didn't see it coming,"" he recalls. ""I wonder how it went downhill so fast. How could I have known this would happen in my generation?""

According to Tam, this decline didn't just affect shipbuilders, but all aspects of life in Lai Chi Vun.

""At the (industry's) peak, people were rushing to work and it was lively. Those were happy times. We would work all year round and have people here dining together. Now, no one comes here to work, so no one comes here to talk to you.""

'Like a human body'

Tam believes that the miniature boats he creates are more than just models.

""The shipbuilding process is the same,"" he said. ""The only difference is the tools used.""

Tam says he uses the same building techniques on his miniatures, as he used on his real ships. Credit: Herbert Chow

The complex techniques and precision required mean that Tam can spend up to 700 hours building a single boat, and will spend three months on each miniature on average.

""At our age, our eyes are not so good,"" he adds, ""so we are slower and can hardly see when it gets very dark... the small parts require more effort.""

There is no room for error, with almost every component supporting another.

""It's just like a human body -- every part is important. If you don't have hands or feet, you can't eat or walk. No one part is more important than the other -- without each part, the boat cannot be completed.""

In 2018, Macao's government recognized the Lai Chi Vun shipyard as a cultural heritage site. But the future of this craft -- and the culture surrounding it -- is dependent on the next generation, he says.

""Some people have started (providing miniature shipbuilding) classes in order to teach young people these skills, and to promote this culture,"" he adds.

""You need people to help with the preservation -- without the help of people, these skills will be lost.""",Historic ship replicas nod to Macao's maritime past,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/shipbuilding-macao-artisans/index.html,2019-08-19T02:38:13+00:00
"(CNN) — With Tokyo set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events -- the Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics -- Japan's capital is making final preparations for the global spotlight.

So what will sports fans notice when they travel here?

First of all, they won't be alone.

Tourism in Tokyo is already booming. Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to over 31 million, with around 10 million stopping in Tokyo. That's supposed to top 40 million in 2020.

However, unlike other destinations in Japan that are visibly struggling to cope with the influx, Tokyo, thanks to its size and a series of measures to prepare for the deluge, has so far been able to absorb them.

Rugby World Cup kicks off this week

The city's Olympic readiness will get a test run when the Rugby World Cup kicks off on September 20 at Tokyo Stadium. Matches will be held in 12 Japanese cities and around 600,000 international rugby fans are expected to descend on the country, taking one third of tickets.

Some 13,000 volunteers have been hired to help rugby fans to navigate the city and enjoy the matches. YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/AFP/Getty Images

Most of those will be from rugby heartlands: the British Isles, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The organizers have promised that all the basics for an exciting and welcoming experience are in place, with 13,000 volunteers, many with English-language skills, on hand on match days.

Tokyo Stadium itself is around 18 kilometers to the west of what can be considered the central part of the city, though there are two official fan zones at the Tokyo Sports Square and Chofu Station Square/Chofu City Green Hall.

Unless Japan is playing, local pubs, known as izakayas, are more likely to be watching the culmination of the baseball season or variety shows on TV than rugby.

This is where some businesses are looking to fill the gap, such as the Hub group of British-style pubs and ANA Intercontinental Hotel Group.

Both are making efforts to target foreign visitors and local sports fans with promotions and fan-theme areas in their bars and hotels to watch live broadcasts of the matches.

""What I most expect is that we will have many foreigners who understand pub culture (because it's originally their culture) and they enjoy chatting and watching sports,"" says Tsuyoshi Ota, president of Hub.

While the sport is growing in the country and Japan's national team, known as ""The Brave Blossoms"" notched a huge win in the tournament against South African four years ago, it still remains niche.

""I think locals will find something big is going on in September seeing so many foreigners and they will give foreigners a warm greeting. I don't think most local people realize that so many people are coming to Japan for the Rugby World Cup,"" says Ota.

Tokoyite and sports fan Kensuke Tezuka also thinks that once the event gets going the atmosphere and local interest level will change.

""Japanese people tend to be quiet in daily life but we get cheerful and friendly in omatsuri (festival) occasions. I remember the 2002 football World Cup. Shibuya Crossing was very lively. The visitors come to Tokyo for a once-in a-lifetime occasion, so they are naturally excited. They will provide a great vibe.""

The 'Olympics effect'

l e v a r t

Japan's government expects the ""Olympics effect"" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.

It's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for ""dramatic change.""

""This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,"" said Koike.

Major developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.

Featuring a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.

The area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.

This includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.

Another hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.

Other changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen ""bullet train"" stations.

To assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.

New Olympics sporting venues

In terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.

Located on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.

On top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.

Visiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.

It will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.

Book those hotel rooms now

According to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.

Among the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.

The original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.

However, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.

Stricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.

Businesses are encouraged to allow employees to work from home to ease pressure on public transportation during the Games. TORU YAMANAKA/AFP/Getty Images

Other stresses are predicted, both for visitors and locals.

While most signage in stations and on public transport in the capital is already in Japanese and English, the influx will put more pressure on the city's infrastructure, particularly the full-to-bursting Metro and other train lines, which visitors will be using just like the city's commuters.

But counter measures are being planned so Olympic spectators and 'salary men' and 'office ladies' don't make each other's journey even more of a squeeze.

For instance, one initiative underway is encouraging businesses to allow shift- and tele-working by its employees -- a concept still hard to digest in Japan's rigid work culture where employees works some of the longest hours in the world.

"Tokyo (CNN) — Often referred to as the world's busiest crosswalk, thousands of pedestrians scramble across Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing daily.

At peak times, the hypnotic pace of the changing traffic light seems to signal the masses into a mesmerizing, yet claustrophobic, waltz.

For many, the controlled chaos of Shibuya's ""Scramble"" epitomizes the efficient madness of the cutting-edge city. Here, 10 lanes of traffic and five major crosswalks converge along a modern canyon of neon-colored buildings in the heart of Tokyo.

The Shibuya Crossing serves as center-stage for a Times Square-inspired New Year's Eve countdown and is the focal point for the wild Halloween celebrations that have grown increasingly famous in recent years.

l e v a r t

Its popularity is easily explained.

Along with Shinjuku Station, the district's Shibuya Station bears the honor of being one of the world's busiest train stations.

Connecting to popular areas such as Shinjuku, Harajuku and Roppongi, it's almost impossible to bypass Shibuya on a visit to Tokyo or even a trip across town. And you wouldn't want to, anyway.

Movers and shakers

Movie buffs will appreciate the fact that ""The Fast and the Furious"" famously slid through the technicolor crossing in the movie series' third installment ""Tokyo Drift.""

Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray fans may remember the ""Lost in Translation"" film scene featuring a sea of clear umbrellas overtaking the intersection. And in the Japanese cult classic ""Battle Royale,"" the crossing stood as a futuristic cityscape in the flick.

It's both a place to see and be seen. Models, and those who would be, strut through the crossing as if on a personal catwalk. It's not uncommon to spot a mascot shimmying across, and there always seems to be a heat of MariCar racers zipping by.It's both a place to see and be seen.

Even during major events such as Halloween, the street remains functional with officials squeezing people onto the sidewalks with retractable ropeways. No matter how busy, traffic at this massive intersection is rarely congested. Emergency vehicles even make their way through rush hour crossings with ease.

In the lead up to the 2020 Olympics, the area has seen significant development and an ever-expanding skyline. The crossing itself undergoes near daily upgrades, with newer and more impressive video boards constantly vying for the attention of passersby.

There are no fewer than five major screens with video and audio impressively synced to each crossing, displaying information such as the weather forecast, during red ""no walk"" signals and often cartoons when the green ""walk"" signal lights up.

The world's most loyal dog

A famed Shibuya meeting spot is this one, epitomized by a legendary, loyal dog. Joshua Mellin

Even though the crosswalk can be a dizzying place, there's one landmark everybody knows: a famed meeting spot epitomized by a legendary, loyal dog.

Hachikō the dog was an akita who would meet his owner Hidesaburō Ueno at the Shibuya Station after work every day in the 1920s. When Ueno died unexpectedly, Hachikō continued to visit the station every day for almost a decade.

His loyalty has become revered in Japan where he is known as chūken Hachikō or ""faithful dog Hachikō,"" and the breed is especially popular in the district.

Today, a near constant line of visitors waits outside the station's exit named for him to take photos with a bronze statue of Hachikō, sometimes offering a wreath of flowers in the summer or a hand-knitted scarf during the colder months.

(Hachikō was still alive and present for the statue's initial unveiling in 1932, but that model was recycled for the war effort, and the current statue is a 1984 remake.)

Even the district's buses and vending machines are adorned with his smiling puppy face, and there's an official Hachikō mascot who frequents the area.

Best viewing platforms

One of the images most associated with Japan is a bird's-eye view of the frenetic crossing. It's a highly sought after image but can be challenging to obtain.

By far the most popular place to snap photos is shopping mall Magnet by Shibuya 109's seventh-floor viewing platform. Standing directly over the crossing, it offers the most immediate angle.

Open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., the cost of admission has varied seasonally since opening in 2018, but as of late has been free of charge.

The deck is equipped with a camera that, for a small fee, can sync to a visitor's smartphone to take selfies from above. The platform is not accessible for baby carriages or wheelchairs.

While the crossing isn't directly visible from train platforms, a bridge in Shibuya Station over the street offers a unique side perspective, and it's the easiest to access. That area of the station doesn't even require a ticket purchase.

A cross-hatch design in the windows makes it a little more difficult to capture the perfect photo, but with ample space and indifferent commuters, it's an easy place to stake a spot.

The Shibuya Hikarie building, which houses offices, shops and theaters, is one of the best places to take in a wider view of the district's full action.

A couple blocks from the main crossing, this taller viewpoint on the 11th floor gives an expansive sight of the crossing over the train station.

"(CNN) — With just over a year till Tokyo hosts the 2020 Summer Olympics, now's the time for travelers planning to take in the sporting action live to start thinking about their accommodation plans.

Particularly those looking for a one-of-a-kind Japanese luxury experience.

Leading the charge in this regard is Hoshinoya Tokyo, owned by hospitality brand Hoshino Resorts.

It isn't a boutique hotel. Nor is it a luxury hotel.

Located in the capital's Otemachi neighborhood -- the political and financial district, near the Imperial Palace -- Hoshinoya Tokyo is at its core a ryokan (Japanese inn).

High-end ryokans aren't common in Japan's big cities. They're more associated with natural settings far from urban streets -- near oceans or against backdrops of mountainous landscapes.

Hoshinoya Tokyo is located in the city's Otemachi neighborhood. Hoshino Resorts

With 17 floors filled with 84 rooms in a black tower that easily blends into its skyscraper-filled surroundings, you could be forgiven for scoffing at the idea there's anything traditional or inn-like about Hoshinoya Tokyo.

Until you experience the thoughtful design elements created by architecture firm Azuma that fill its spaces.

For instance, Hoshinoya Tokyo's exterior is cased in a metal lattice made up of patterns traditionally found on kimonos.

But unless you're a guest, that's where the tour comes to an end. Outside visitors are not allowed in.

Several mini ryokans in one

There's no large, flashy entrance helmed by a white-gloved doorman where cars can pull in. (Our taxi driver let us out on the road, across the street, as he just couldn't find the place.)

Upon stepping through the ryokan's enormous entryway door, made from a single cut of cypress, a single staff member appears on the scene to confirm your booking. You're then asked to remove shoes to protect the scented tatami flooring that blankets the property.

Footwear is placed in bamboo lockers, ready to be accessed when you leave this fortress of calm to brave the busy streets of Tokyo, before you're escorted to your room.

Each floor has its own central lounge -- or ochanoma -- that's shared by guests of the six rooms on each floor. This is because Hoshinoya Tokyo was designed to feel like several mini ryokans in one.

Guests can help themselves to complimentary refreshments such as seasonal teas, coffee, sake, beer and snacks.

There are three room options available, ranging in size from 40-49 square meters: Sakura (deluxe king or deluxe twin), Yuri (corner deluxe king) and Kiku (executive triple).

All combine high-tech and contemporary furnishings with traditional Japanese design elements -- classic shoji screens included.

We stayed in the Kiku option, a corner room that includes a dining table, desk and a large sofa. Beds are futon style -- but with luxurious, plush bedding.

Breakfast is served in-room -- guests can choose from Western or Japanese cuisine.

This being a ryokan, a set of his and her kimonos can be found in your closet. Wearing them around the property adds to the ryokan vibe, as you pad across the bamboo and sandalwood scented tatami floors in sock-feet to go to dinner.

Where are the other guests?

This is a place that was designed for privacy, relaxation and quiet, so much so that you'll often feel like you're the only guest in the building -- and one reason it might not be suited for everyone.

During a recent visit, the only sign of fellow travelers could be seen in the main lobby on the second floor, an area where guests can participate in demonstrations highlighting various facets of traditional Japanese arts, such as matcha tea ceremonies or classical music, as well as sake tasting sessions.

This welcome feeling of solitude extends to the ryokan's single, unnamed restaurant too.

Located in the basement, it has just six tatami-matted private rooms with tables and seating, and an open space consisting of four tables and a counter.

The restaurant's multi-course dinner comes from the hands of award-winning chef Noriyuki Hamada -- much to the chagrin of local foodies. (Remember, guests only.)

Diners are served a brilliant series of dishes dubbed Nippon Cuisine. According to the resort, this is ""a culinary style that focuses on fish -- a common staple of ryokan dining and a key element in Japanese culinary culture"" -- and prepared using French techniques.

Open-air soaks

This being a ryokan, there's of course an in-house onsen (hot spring bathing area). Water is piped in from 1,500 meters below the streets of Tokyo.

If not for the memorable cuisine of chef Noriyuki we'd go so far to say this is the star attraction of Hoshinoya Tokyo.

Located on the top floor, the onsen offers male and female bath halls, each with indoor and outdoor sections connected by a tunnel.

Like many Japanese onsen, tattoos need to be covered -- a challenge considering you need to bathe naked. But hotel staff are happy to provide flesh-colored stickers to cover your ink with. (At this point, you might find yourself re-thinking that full-back piece you got in college.)

There's no fitness center, but guests in need of a workout can access the gym in a nearby building or go for a run on the five-kilometer trail that loops around the Imperial Palace.

There is, however, an onsite spa offering a variety of massages and other treatments.

Hoshinoya Tokyo's successful attempt to create a peaceful sanctuary in one of the world's most populated cities shouldn't come as a surprise.

Hoshino Resorts has been in this game for over a century. It was founded in 1904 by Kuniji Hoshino, who opened his first hot spring resort in 1914.

Long familiar to Japanese travelers, the brand is only now starting to weave its unique style of hospitality into international markets.

"(CNN) — Wild, weird, wonderful... there are many ways to describe the Crazy House (also known as Hang Nga Guesthouse) in Dalat, a relaxed mountain resort town in southern Vietnam

One thing's for sure: This ""crazy"" complex is one of a kind.

Standing in stark contrast to Dalat's French colonial villas, the bizarre avant garde guesthouse is a maze of spiral staircases, sculptural bedrooms, undulating surfaces, swirls of bright colors, narrow bridges and hidden nooks.

The artist behind the structure, 79-year-old Dang Viet Nga, says it's the ultimate expression of her imagination.

""Crazy House is a culmination of my life and creativity -- it all came together in this structure,"" Dang, daughter of Vietnam's former general secretary Truong Chinh, tells CNN Travel

""I wanted to create something original, pioneering -- different from anything else in the world.""

An exercise in creativity

After earning a PhD in architecture in Moscow, Dang worked for several years in Russia then moved to Hanoi, where she worked on government projects.

On a business trip to Dalat, Dang says she fell in love with the lush landscape, cooler climate and kind people and hoped to eventually move there.

In 1983, she relocated to Dalat with her then 8-year-old son, Nguyen Viet Thang.

After years of working on state-owned developments, which afforded little creativity, she felt compelled to unleash her imagination.

The Crazy House has 10 guest rooms, each named after an animal or plant. Courtesy Crazy House

In February 1990, she drew up plans for Crazy House. But instead of blueprints, she created a series of paintings to communicate her fantastical vision.

As a form of expressionist architecture, the house has no right angles but rather organic forms that are designed to mirror natural elements, like mushrooms, shells, caves and spiderwebs.

Dang Viet Nga, artist “Crazy House will never really be finished. It's like a living thing. It is always changing.”

""With this form, you have to try to free your mind,"" she says. ""There are no rules -- aside from basic structural principles [to make sure it's safe and stable] -- it's all about self-expression.""

When it came time to construct the house, Dang used various types of materials, including steel, wood and concrete.

""My mother used a lot of concrete because it's inexpensive and very easy to play with,"" says her son Nguyen, who is now 44.

Related content Lonely Planet's best places to visit in Asia Pacific for 2019

""Since she can create whatever shape she wants, it reflects what she is envisioning in her mind.""

Less than a year later, the guesthouse was open for business and welcoming its first guests.

Closer to nature

Today, Crazy House feels like woodland fantasy brought to life.

""I felt that, over the last century, people have really destroyed nature. Not just in Vietnam, but around the world,"" says Dang. ""So I wanted to create a structure that brings people closer to nature.""

An elevated main house, which looks like it belongs in Hansel and Gretel, sits in the center of an open courtyard, surrounded by four enormous tree houses.

The Crazy House has been welcoming guests since 1991. Courtesy Crazy House

Sinuous cement ""branches,"" which double as bridges, twist and wind between the various houses so people can move from one to the next.

At first glance, the surreal structures recall mind-bending scenes from a Salvador Dali painting or perhaps even the organic works of modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.

The playful style continues within the tree houses, where 10 guest rooms -- each named after an animal or type of plant -- are full of organic shapes, cavern-like beds, and wooden seating areas.

""Reconnecting nature is one message that I want to communicate with the house,"" says Dang.

""But it's also a message to others to think outside of the box. Don't limit yourself by the rules and the expectations -- free your mind and let your imagination run wild.""

Following her own advice, Dang is continues to dream up new additions to the property while Nguyen now manages the business.

She is currently dreaming up two new gardens -- a Land Garden and a Sky Garden -- to add more greenery and flowers, as well as another tree house.

""I would say that Crazy House will never really be finished,"" says Nguyen. ""It's like a living thing. It is always changing.""

How to visit

In addition to staying in one of Crazy House's guest rooms, visitors can also tour the Dalat attraction for a fee. Though there's no restaurant, visitors can purchase drinks and snacks at a stall in the garden.",The story behind Vietnam's 'Crazy House',http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/crazy-house-dalat-vietnam/index.html,2019-08-25T23:50:53+00:00
"(CNN) — Set on the banks of the Thu Bon River in central Vietnam , Hoi An is easily one of the most beautiful towns in Southeast Asia.

The action revolves around the atmospheric Old Town -- a colonial-era trade port that was added to UNESCO's World Heritage list in 1999 -- where dreamy canals, French-colonial merchant houses, Japanese bridges, Chinese shophouses and low-key restaurants vie for your attention.

In the quarter's slow-paced laneways, foliage tumbles from shophouse rooftops and residents pedal by on bicycles, unfazed by the heat. Come evening, rows and rows of silk lanterns glow against the inky sky.

And with a few more high-profile international hotels in the works, including the upcoming Alila Hoi An in 2020 and Rosewood Hoi An in 2021, the historic town of just 120,000 people is firmly on every savvy traveler's radar.

Here are seven great reasons to pack your bags and travel to Hoi An:

A whole lotta history

Vietnam's basket boats can be spotted in the waters around Hoi An and nearby Da Nang. Joel Santos

Once a major player in the coveted spice trade, Hoi An served as a busy Asian trading port between the 16th and 19th centuries.

The city attracted merchants from Japan, China, Portugal and France, and the resulting cultural milieu remains visible in everything from the mustard-colored shophouses to dining traditions, folk crafts and robust coffee culture.

You can feel it at the major landmarks, too. On the western end of Old Town, narrow pedestrian streets give way to an 18th-century Japanese covered bridge while ancient ancestral homes, such as the Tan Ky House, mix together Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese architectural traditions.

Delicious food

Hoi An is the banh mi capital of Vietnam. Kate Springer/CNN

Hoi An is commonly considered one of Vietnam's best destinations for food lovers and it delivers on the hype.

You'll devour every kind of food experience here -- graze street food snacks from roadside vendors, slurp noodles on plastic stools, enjoy fresh seafood by the beach or shell out for a splurge.

You'll find a kaleidoscope of tropical fruits and street food at the Central Market, while local signatures like white rose dumplings (made of shrimp or pork with shallots wrapped in translucent rice paper) and crispy cao lầu (a noodle dish starring pork belly and rice crackers) make appearances on most local restaurant menus.

Lest we forget the cultural mash-up that is the banh mi. Some of the city's best banh mi -- stuffed with pate, barbecued pork, chili sauce and vegetables wrapped inside crispy baguettes -- can be found in Old Town at spots like Madame Phuong or Madam Khanh the Banh Mi Queen

There are few chain restaurants in sight. Instead, family-run cafes and restaurants are the norm -- most of which have open-air balconies and no-frills furniture.

Worthwhile souvenirs

Let's just say you might want to bring an empty suitcase.

There are high-quality souvenirs tempting you at every corner, from silk tailoring shops and custom leatherware workshops to coffee roasters, handmade ceramics stalls, beautiful bamboo lantern makers and contemporary home decor boutiques.

There's nothing kitschy about these goods -- in fact, you might treasure a suit tailored in Hoi An or a leather carryall for years to come.

When it comes to tailoring, shops such as Sam Ao Dai , Hung An Cloth Shop (653 Hai Ba Trung) or Sewing Bee Tailors can turn around an order the next day. But if you're not in a hurry, we'd suggest allowing time for alterations.

For a more couture experience, Yaly Couture and A Dong Silk specialize in bespoke, luxurious apparel that would be appropriate for everything from boardrooms to ballrooms.

Another area where Hoi An's contemporary designers shine is homeware accessories.

The light and airy Sunday in Hoi An boutique, for instance, is full of beautiful hand-painted tiles, bamboo furniture, eco-friendly apparel, bedding and bath accessories.

Beautiful beaches

Hoi An is more of a river town than a beach getaway, but sunseekers can easily reach the coastline.

About a 10-minute drive northeast, travelers will find themselves overlooking the East Sea with sweeps of sand running for miles in both directions.

My Khe might be the most famous strip, but An Bang Beach is the most beautiful. Along this tranquil and largely undeveloped shoreline, it's all about low-key beach shacks, chilled beer and live music.

Another safe bet are the beaches around the Son Tra Peninsula, a nature reserve about 25 minutes north by car, where the water's clean and clear.

A biker's paradise

Whether you prefer to pedal around on a bicycle or zip off on a Vespa, Hoi An's wide open country roads are ideal for exploring on two wheels.

The city just launched a new bike-sharing program in June and most hotels offer bike rentals.

It's easy to gently cruise through Old Town, or you can cycle over to Cam Nam Village, the island just to the south across the river, for a peek at rural life.

For countryside tours, Vespa Adventures is your best option.

On the back of a restored 1960s-era Italian scooter, these half-day excursions take travelers across Thu Bon River on a local boat, over a rickety bamboo bridge, across gleaming green rice paddy fields where water buffalo soak up the sun.

World-class hotels

The Four Seasons The Nam Hai is one of the area's most luxurious hotels. Four Seasons

Often jumbled into a two-for-one vacation, Hoi An and nearby Da Nang -- just 15 minutes up the coastline -- play host to some of Vietnam's most alluring hotels.

Brought to life by prolific resort designer Bill Bensley, the contemporary oasis spills across the hills of the Son Tra Peninsula, a nature reserve that's home to rare red-shanked douc monkeys and pangolins.

Then there's Four Seasons Resort The Nam Hai along the coastline, where you can dine on upscale Vietnamese street food at beachfront restaurant La Sen or splurge on a spa treatment.

Nearby, Fusion Maia has become synonymous with wellness paradise, promising guests unlimited (and all-inclusive) spa treatments.

As well as the Alila Hoi An coming up soon, the area will also welcome the Dusit Thani Hoi An as well as a beachfront Rosewood Hoi An in 2021.

Side trips galore

And if you grow weary of Hoi An's charms and grace? In that unlikely scenario, there are lots of side trips around the region.

If you're into history and architecture, Hue -- the imperial capital set on the picturesque Perfume River -- deserves an overnight visit.

A three-hour drive north from Hoi An rewards history buffs with major sites like the tombs of the ancient emperors, various citadels and pretty pagodas.

"(CNN) — Thanks in part to its serpentine shape and lengthy coastline, Vietnam is home to wildly diverse landscapes.

As you travel around the Southeast Asian country, you'll be surrounded by photogenic scenery -- from lush rice terraces in northern Sapa to the white sandy beaches of Phu Quoc.

Vietnam's architecture is particularly notable, too.

As a French colony from 1887 to 1954, the country is also peppered with historic government buildings and merchant houses along crucial trade routes -- such as Hoi An, in central Vietnam.

There's more to Vietnam's diverse noodle scene than pho. You'll be seeing red when you tuck into a bowl of bun rieu, a crab-based vermicelli soup.

The mighty Mekong adds to the diverse scenery, rushing through the southern lowlands and branching off into tiny canals that fuel agriculture in rural communities.

"Written by Andrew Newey Ladakh, India

Andrew Newey is an award-winning British photographer. The images in this feature were taken during his recent trip to document the lives of Pashmina goat herders.

At an altitude of more than 14,000 feet, where winter temperatures can fall to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, it is hard to believe anyone, or anything, can survive in the vast ice desert that is Changthang, on the Tibetan Plateau between India and China. Situated between the Himalayan and Karakorum mountain ranges, it is the highest permanently inhabited plateau in the world, and home to an extremely hardy and rare breed of goat -- the Changra, or Pashmina goat.

The region's high altitudes, freezing temperatures and harsh winds are essential in stimulating the growth of the goats' super-soft undercoat. The fibers can measure a mere 12 microns in width, making them around eight times finer than human hair and up to eight times warmer than sheep wool. This luxurious fiber is known as Pashmina, the softest and most expensive type of cashmere wool in the world.

Rearing these valuable animals in such inhospitable conditions are the Changpa people. For centuries these nomadic shepherds, who are as hardy as their animals, have roamed ""the roof of the world,"" moving their herds of yak, sheep and goats along traditional migratory routes every few months in search of fresh grazing pastures.

Moving thousands of goats over vast distances requires skill and experience if herders are to prevent injury to -- or loss of -- their animals. Credit: Andrew Newey

But their ancient way of life is now under threat from climate change, fake Pashmina imports from China and the lure of an easier and more comfortable life.

I have known of the Changpa people for some time, but it was only recently that I learned of their struggles. I visited them in the Ladakh region, on the Indian side of the plateau, to photograph their winter migration in early December.

Changthang rarely gets much snowfall, and when it does, it usually begins in January or February. For the last few years, however, it has been increasingly heavy, starting as early as December, even November.

The goats naturally begin shedding their fur in the spring, and herders harvest it using a special comb. Credit: Andrew Newey

The unexpected snowfall was great for my pictures, but it was a major inconvenience for the herders. The high pass they travel through is untraversable once covered in snow, and food supplements have to be brought in to prevent the animals dying from starvation.

The nomads and scientists alike are adamant that climate change is the biggest threat to Pashmina production in the region. And despite the snowfall, the winters are in fact getting warmer, which reduces the quality and quantity of the valuable Pashmina wool. Warmer temperatures mean that the goats don't grow such thick undercoats, reducing the yield of this soft fur and making it harder to separate from the coarse outer fur.

Over a relatively short period of time, dozens of nomad families from the Changthang plateau have migrated away from their village, Kharnak, to the outskirts of Leh, a city 180 kilometers away. There, the herders who have given up their nomadic lives have set up their own neighborhood, called Kharnak Ling.

On my recent visit to the region, the chief of Kharnak village, Targais Tashi, expressed his concerns. ""These are worrying times we are experiencing,"" he said. ""If weather patterns continue (changing) like they are, then it could have an irreversible impact on Pashmina goat-rearing on the Changthang. There were once more than 90 families in Kharnak and now there are only 16. If the number Changpa families in Kharnak fall below 10 then it will become too tough for us to continue this life.

""The younger generation would rather work in the city and cannot be persuaded to continue this physically, mentally and emotionally demanding existence.""

Despite the herders' brutal living conditions, they are some of the friendliest and most generous people one could ever wish to meet. They let me live with them and capture moments of their life on the understanding that I would spread awareness of their struggles. The region is desperately hoping that revenue from international tourism can help fill the economic hole left by the struggling Pashmina industry.

Many Changpa women have abandoned their nomadic lives, and now weave the wool outside the city of Leh. Credit: Andrew Newey

The Indian government's Ministry of Textiles has attempted to reverse the trend by providing funding and supplies to encourage the Changpas to return to rearing goats on the plateau.

In recent years however, due to a lack of Pashmina wool from Ladakh's herders, weavers in the wider Kashmir region have begun importing raw Pashmina from China and Mongolia to meet ever-increasing demand for their products. Much of this Pashmina is not what it is claimed to be. Although the goats are the same breed, they are not reared in the extreme conditions required to stimulate the growth of the super-soft undercoat required to be considered 100% pure Pashmina.

Pashmina is expensive -- and rightly so. The Changpa carefully comb the goats' hair during the spring molting season to harvest the downy undercoat, and then the good fiber is laboriously separated from the bad by hand. Once cleaned and processed, the usable wool from a cashmere goat amounts to just four ounces.

Every few months, the herders migrate with their yak, sheep and goats in search of fresh grazing pastures. Credit: Andrew Newey

The fibers are then hand spun, after which the equally painstaking weaving process can begin. A Pashmina shawl can take around 180 hours to produce, and larger items can take several months or even a year for highly skilled artisans to weave on wooden looms. They are then exported around the world, where luxury retailers sell them for hundred or thousands or dollars.

Amid decreasing herd populations and increasing demand for cashmere from the Ladakh region, scientists at the University of Kashmir set out to produce the world's first Pashmina goat clone. In 2012, the female kid Noori was born. But the idea of using clones more widely has proven controversial among the Changpa herders, who see it as incompatible with their Buddhist beliefs.

The perils to goat rearing in turn threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the region who, directly or indirectly depend on Pashmina. The trade's decline could also spell the end of the unique culture of the Changpas, for whom livestock are more than a source of income, but a way of life.",Pashmina goat herders in a struggle against climate change,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pashmina-goat-herders-struggle-against-climate-change/index.html,2020-01-02T08:51:29+00:00
"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

As James Bond in the 1974 classic ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" actor Roger Moore pilots a seaplane above the clear gemstone waters of Thailand's Phang Nga Bay, meant to be somewhere off the coast of China.

Bond's antagonist, the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, has fortified his hideout within a towering limestone karst. When 007 enters the secluded home, Scaramanga's henchman, Nick Nack, flips a switch from the home's control station, sending the hero into a dizzying red-lit funhouse of horrors.

Miami-based architect Chad Oppenheim first saw the film and Scaramanga's hideout when he was seven years old. It was the start of an obsession with the ultimate lair. ""Either I could become a supervillain and build one of these (lairs), or become an architect,"" he said.

Oppenheim explores his darker road not traveled in ""Lair,"" a recent book from Tra Publishing, that renders 15 highly secretive dwellings in black-and-white architectural drawings. They include the Nordic alpine hideaway in ""Ex Machina,"" the spidery underwater sea home in ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" the sleek Mount Rushmore abode in ""North By Northwest,"" and the eerie Brutalist Wallace Corporation HQ in ""Blade Runner 2049.""

The lairs generally share commonalities: They are pristine, awe-inspiring, high-tech, otherworldly, often impractical, and draw heavily on the tenets of modernism. The book poses the question: Why do bad guys live in good houses?

""Villain's lairs always have the sexiest architecture, inviting you to be the bad guy,"" said Leah Greenblatt, critic-at-large of Entertainment Weekly, at a panel in New York City for the book. Besides the titular childhood home in ""Skyfall,"" she asked, ""does James Bond even have a home?"" Oppenhenheim toyed with the idea of the hero's hideout too -- the Bat Cave, the Fortress of Solitude -- but generally finds supervillains have ""a little bit more depth to them,"" he said.

Oppenheim and his team came up with a rubric for which hideouts made the final cut -- and what counted as true villainry. ""First, primarily, the lairs had to be aspirational. They also had to be incredibly beautiful from an architectural standpoint,"" he explained. They omitted the lavish John Lautner-designed mansion of porn director Jackie Treehorn in ""The Big Lebowski,"" not deeming him a real antagonist. Darth Vader's hellfire stronghold in ""Star Wars"" also lost out in favor of the Death Star because Oppenheim decided nobody would actually want to live on an untenable volcanic planet.

They also opted for bad guys who had grand visions for humanity, not so much the brutal nature of serial killers like Hannibal Lecter. ""They're very utopian, in a way, in that they believe they're actually doing the right things -- like most megalomaniacs,"" Oppenheim said. Their chosen architecture represents their colorful personalities. ""A lot of these villains either want to be old-world gentlemen or they want to be super hyper-modern, and there's not really an in-between,"" Greenblatt noted -- except for the high-tech exterior, ""Downton Abbey""-like interior of Karl Stromberg's sea arachnid, she conceded.

""Lair"" examines how modernist, futuristic, and utopian architecture has long been associated with amorality. Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, sleek homes, equally minimal and extravagant, made of glass, steel, and concrete, have become the archetypal home for the idealistic recluse with dastardly ambition.

""Modern domestic architecture has become identified almost exclusively with characters who are evil, unstable, selfish, obsessive, and driven by pleasure of the flesh,"" Joseph Rosa writes in an essay in the book. ""Were they still alive, this might thoroughly shock the pioneers of modernism, who envisioned their movement facilitating a healthy, honest, and moral way of life.""

While family life on television has most often been portrayed in cozy, traditional settings, modernist digs have been reserved for wayward bachelors -- like Don Draper of ""Mad Men"" leaving his suburban colonial home with Betty for cleaner lines and a new love interest in Manhattan.

Modern architecture has not been as readily embraced by Americans. In addition, Rosa points out, mistrust of technology following World War II deepened the idea that progress and innovation could be dangerous.

Production designers often reference Brutalism's monumental poured concrete forms or Constructivism's collective social ideas to build out dystopian settings. The Ken Adams-designed bunker in ""Dr. Strangelove"" and the bleak tower blocks in ""A Clockwork Orange"" both follow this lineage. On the panel, film critic Chris Nashawaty commented on Constructivism: ""It's an architecture of propaganda, and like all these villains or dictators or communist rulers ... it's all about convincing people that there's power and thought and might.""

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer

But many supervillains are drawn to the natural world as well. Such inclinations find an unlikely influence in Frank Lloyd Wright, whose organic architecture movement preached a symbiosis with the environment. Hollywood often finds its favorite lairs in the designs of architect and Wright protege John Lautner: the Hollywood Hills lookout homes in ""Body Double"" and ""Lethal Weapon 2,"" and the desert hideout in ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Wright's presence appears again in ""North By Northwest.""

The story of the epic war fought over a woman has been told many times. It now lies at the heart of an ongoing exhibition at the British Museum.

Troy: Myth and Reality "" introduces audiences to the history of the archaeological site of Troy (modern-day Hisarlik, Turkey), many of the different individuals caught up in the Trojan War and various later responses to this powerful legend in drama and literature.

That the story of the Trojan War should be the subject of a blockbuster exhibition comes as little surprise. Ever since classical antiquity, audiences have been consistently telling and retelling stories about the site of Troy and the heroic war that was fought there between the Trojans and the Achaeans (later conflated with the Greeks). The most famous telling of all perhaps is ""The Iliad"" from the 8th century B.C., composed by Homer, a figure shrouded in mystery.

The Homeric poem captures the story of a dreadful, ten-year war fought between two nations. It shows the major influence of powerful men on the battlefield, such as the Trojan prince Hector and the commander of the Myrmidons, Achilles. For these individuals, deeds performed in war will secure them ""everlasting fame.""

But the poem also illustrates the horrendous impact of the war far away from the battlefield. In one memorable passage, Briseis, the captive prisoner of Achilles, laments the slaughter of her husband and children. It is a heartbreaking account that shows acutely the universal misery brought on by the bloodshed of war.

Troy after Homer

Ever since Homer, people have looked to expand on and retell different aspects of the Trojan War in light of their own circumstances.

The 5th century B.C. Athenian playwright Euripides produced several plays that depicted the aftermath of the conflict. In his play ""The Trojan Women,"" Euripides centers the widows of Troy and the hardships they endure at the hands of their Greek oppressors, who divide the women like booty between themselves.

It is an uncompromising account that many have read as a biting commentary on the civil war fought between Athens and Sparta at the end of the 5th century BCE. The play does not glorify war and instead highlights its horrors through Troy's displaced women.

Of course, the creation of refugees through warfare and the transportation of human bodies across geographic boundaries is a profound concern for audiences today. The ongoing Syrian civil war has created around 6.7 million refugees , who have been dispersed across the globe. And the recent shocking discovery of 39 Vietnamese nationals' bodies in a lorry in Grays, Essex in October is a ghastly reminder of the terrible conditions that many refugees have faced past and present.

Troy today

In contemporary culture too, there has been a spate of interest in the stories and myths of Troy.

The exhibition shows clearly the impact it has had on the visual arts. Highlights include a 1978 collage by the African American artist Romare Bearden, titled ""The Sirens' Song,"" which recasts Odysseus' journey home after the war with African American subjects. Bearden's work employs the familiar story of Troy to give the African American experience a universal and classical representation.

Another notable work is a print called ""Judgement of Paris"" (2007), pictured above, by the conceptual artist Eleanor Antin. The photo, which riffs on Peter Paul Ruben's "" Judgement of Paris "" (1639), highlights the powerlessness of Helen who sits looking outwards, forced to the margins of the image. Antin's work turns this on its head. Featured as part of a series called ""Helen's Odyssey,"" the photo challenges a tradition that has often vilified the Spartan queen Helen for her involvement in the war.

A recent significant development has been the growing number of English-language fictional accounts about Troy written by women. These works retell and expand on various aspects of the Trojan War story from the perspective of the women involved. They range from Pat Barker's ""The Silence of the Girls,"" which retells ""The Iliad"" from the perspective of the story's women, to Madeline Miller's bestseller ""Circe,"" a feminist exploration of certain events from ""The Odyssey."" Such works offer a potent challenge to a tradition that has been wholly dominated by male authors and male-centered stories.

An especially impressive entry in this burgeoning group of women writers' works on Troy is Alice Oswald's 2011 poem ""Memorial,"" an idiosyncratic translation of ""The Iliad."" The poem evokes various contemporary war memorials, such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, in its opening which lists the names of almost all the men whose deaths are reported in ""The Iliad.""

What's more, the poem records moments in which the soldiers of ""The Iliad"" die on the battlefield. In doing so, as in ""The Iliad,"" Oswald repeatedly draws attention to bereaved parents, widowed partners and fatherless children. In an age where technology has changed the methods and image of warfare, desensitizing us to such violence, works like ""Memorial"" are a timely reminder of the human costs of deadly conflict.

It is clear, then, that Troy and the stories that surround it continue to shape culture thousands of years after the Trojan War ostensibly occurred. This is what makes the British Museum exhibition so relevant for audiences today. The story of the Trojan War is a story of universal suffering that stretches past the battlefield. It is a story that highlights the absurdity of war, which at its core holds sentiments that ring as true today as they did in antiquity.",From the 'Iliad' to 'Circe': Culture's enduring fascination with the myths of Troy,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/culture-fascination-with-the-myths-of-troy/index.html,2020-01-03T01:22:20+00:00
"Written by Ananda Pellerin, CNN

From the sinister, suit-clad cast of 2011's Cold War thriller ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" to Emma Watson's ballroom-ready Belle in 2017's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" British designer Jacqueline Durran is no stranger to costuming period films.

The secret to success for the Oscar winner -- she won an Academy Award in Costume Design for ""Anna Karenina"" in 2012 -- is her personal approach, designing as much for actors as she does for their characters.

For Greta Gerwig's ""Little Women,"" she dressed a star-studded cast including Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen, as the four March sisters.

Durran's modern sensibility is matched only by her carefully researched designs, bringing to life the 2019 adaptation of the 1868 classic novel. CNN spoke with her in a phone interview from London.

CNN: How did you channel the era and characters for ""Little Women""?

Jacqueline Durran: The first thing I do for any project is research the period. For ""Little Women"" I looked at contemporary photographs and paintings, and at fashion magazines from the time, which were really just books on how to make things and small line drawings of what was fashionable.

I also looked at pictures of artists and radical communities, and people who were using photography to represent a different way of seeing things. I felt like that was the spirit of the March sisters.

How do you balance the fictional character with the actress playing her?

In the first fitting I'll have the research, and I just sit down and talk through with them what kind of elements I like.

Then they start trying things on. At this stage it's usually just shapes to get a feeling of the silhouette of the character, what the mood is. Then you start thinking about fabrics and the number of costume changes, you sort of pull it all together into a story arc.

Working with the actress is by far the most rewarding way of doing it. I love actresses who are engaged in what they want to look like.

Did you get that on ""Little Women?""

100%. Also, I've known Saiorse since she was twelve, when we both worked on ""Atonement.""

How did you choose the color palettes for each of the March girls?

They were taken from the color of the notebooks that Marmee (the girls' mother, played by Laura Dern) gives them on Christmas Day.

Actress Saoirse Ronan as Jo March. Credit: Sony Pictures

Jo's color is red. I presume it reflects her temper, or her spirit. But I didn't want her to wear red really obviously throughout the whole movie, so I threaded the color in and out of her story. She often has a bit of red on but very rarely all red, though she does for the first party.

It was the same with Meg. I think her actual color was green, but we didn't want her to be just wearing that, so we balanced it with lavender.

Beth's colors were pink to brown, which we ran with, and Amy's was light blue, which comes in and out of her story.

Are there specific challenges to dressing an ensemble cast instead of a solo lead?

You have to think about the actress in the context of the other actresses. It also just means a lot of costumes. Instead of one leading lady with twelve changes, you've got five women with twelve changes -- that's already sixty costumes. It's a mountain of clothing to design and make, while keeping things fresh and not repetitive.

But the ensemble cast was one of the biggest pleasures for me, because the actresses were all amazing.

The costumes have a contemporary feel to them even though they are clearly period pieces -- how did you strike this balance?

When I first met with Amy Pascal, the producer, and Greta, I got the feeling that while they wanted it to be accurate to the period, they didn't want something that felt too strictly Victorian in a way that meant you couldn't identify with the characters.

I tried to make it seem like the actresses really lived in the clothes. They had leeway in how they wore them, and also reused things in different combinations so you got the sense that these were items from their own wardrobes. In the spirit of Greta's film, you don't feel like you're in a very formal world, you feel like you're in something much looser.

The March girls struggle with work-life balance, finding love, keeping family, creating a home and trying to be independent in the world. ""Little Women"" still feels relevant today.

Greta often uses the example that Louisa May Alcott kept her copyright, but Taylor Swift currently has a problem with her own copyright. We're still fighting the same battles and the same issues around status.

One of the joys of this film is that you get to see four different women, and each way of being is equally valid. For instance, Jo comes off as smart about how the world works, while Amy is an artist who is going to make her way. But, 150 years on, I fear that economics for women are not as advanced as they should be.

What was it like dressing Timothée Chalamet, who plays Jo's supportive friend Laurie?

The challenge of dressing men is finding a way to create character within a limited range of choices -- menswear just doesn't have the variety that womenswear does.

But with Timothée, I had a broad range of styles to draw from. I wanted to make him look like a privileged, artistic boy. I had some reference pictures of young boys dressed in velvet suits from the mid-nineteenth-century, and I combined that aesthetic with shapes from boyswear of an earlier decade.

When it came to his later, grown-up costumes I pushed the reference later, into the 1880s, though one of the key references was a Tissot painting of a group of men in Paris in 1867.

Even ten years ago there would have been a high chance this film would have been directed by a man. Have you seen the industry change over your career?

I have but not as much as you'd think. It's a bit like the world, you feel like things have moved on a lot and then you think, hang on, no actually we're still not there yet.

I have worked with some women directors, but I'm thrilled there are more coming through. It would be great to get to a point where women represented different voices in directing, rather than just being women directors. We need a broad spectrum of people telling a broad spectrum of stories.

Greta is one of those people, she is an inspiration. What she represented as a widely loved actress is what she's brought to the spirit of her directing. It's something that everyone can imagine and be enthusiastic about straight away. For her to take on this film and do such a great job is a big step forward.",'Little Women': Costumes get a modern spin in Greta Gerwig adaptation,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/little-women-costumes-jacqueline-durran/index.html,2019-12-26T00:40:44+00:00

A woman in red stands in a vacant parking lot, fabric billowing in an upward arc to obscure her face. She extends her right arm outward, hand gently cupped, guiding the viewer toward the direction they might take. The low-slung ochre building behind her and her cherry-hued pencil skirt could be from the past, but no details pinpoint a specific place or time.

This is the image that began Mexican photographer Tania Franco Klein's ""Proceed to the Route"" (2018--ongoing), a series that saturates dystopian unease in the warmth of nostalgia.

At first glance, one might not think that Klein is examining our modern digital age -- the works appear as if they predate home computers -- but Klein wields ambiguity to evoke memory and a creeping sense of disquiet in photographs that ask if it's possible to truly disconnect.

Klein's practice primarily features cinematic self-portraiture, though her starting point for this particular body of work was a portrait of someone else. She had been preoccupied with the idea of Siri, a faceless, digital female voice guiding our lives -- this image seemed to represent her in physical form. But after taking the photograph in a parking lot, she had little clarity as to what to do next.

The series didn't fully reveal itself until she was on a meandering road trip with her boyfriend through the Californian desert. They lost their internet connection and yet Siri diligently repeated: ""Proceed to the route. Proceed to the route. Proceed to the route.""

The real life Siri?

Klein explores the idea of hyperconnectivity through the western microtowns that have been left behind as urbanization has concentrated the country's population -- and high speed internet connections -- in major cities. She was drawn to ""these in-between places,"" she said in a phone interview, and sought them out across California, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.

""Proceed to the Route"" is an on-going series. Credit: Tania Franco Klein

As her own female protagonist, Klein is always alone, her face often obscured by shadow, cropped in the frame, or turned away from the camera entirely. There's no sense of freedom in the images -- the title is a reminder that even in this narrow world, seemingly devoid of human presence, she has little free will.

It's a familiar feeling today, as the internet becomes more consolidated under a handful of dominant social media sites that we rely on for human connection. ""We're participating in this system where we want to be rewarded for what we are, who we are, and what we do constantly,"" Klein said. ""Disconnecting is this dream, something you can't achieve fully.""

In just three years, Klein has become an emerging artist to watch. She is now represented by Rosegallery and has exhibited internationally at major festivals and fairs. She's won awards from LensCulture, Sony Photography Awards and Photo London.

Klein began examining modern anxieties following her graduation from London's University of the Arts MA program in 2016.

After London, she became restless, moving between Madrid, Israel, California, and Mexico for one to two months at a time. Unmoored, her anxiety and depression began to grow. It wasn't just her, she realized -- many of her friends, living all over the world, were experiencing the same extreme unease over the future. In a bookstore in Madrid, she found the book ""The Burnout Society,"" by South Korean-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han, and it spoke to her -- the idea that as a society we are obsessed with performing, multi-tasking, optimizing, and self-improvement, fueling a collective and deeply rooted sense of anxiety and isolation.

Klein captures the emotions of modern anxieties. Credit: Tania Franco Klein

""We could always be learning something, like on your phone learning languages,"" Klein said. ""The world is in the palm of your hand and you can have access to everything. Every second of your life has to be productive -- it's like we've become production tools.""

Rich in color and shadows, Klein's photographs grapple with isolation and melancholy in every day life. Credit: Tania Franco Klein

That concept became the underlying concept for her series ""Our Life in the Shadows"" (2016--2018) in which exhaustion and malaise overshadow the rich jewel tones and shadowy environments as people go about their everyday lives. She published the body of work in the book ""Positive Disintegration"" this year with French publisher Éditions Bessard.

In all of her work, Klein shows an interest in ambiguous spaces, characters and time.

""My world is more psychological, emotional and intimate,"" she said. ""I'm not trying to create a story."" There are no beginnings or endings, no single narrative thread, but all scenes exist all at once for viewers to unravel. At Rosegallery, she frames some works and prints others as wall murals, letting images overlap and intersect.

There is no real escape in Klein's work, no solace in the beauty of the land. Her interiors ""are emotionally claustrophobic,"" she said, but her protagonists outside find little respite -- they are ""trapped in these barren landscapes."" In these non-places -- a term coined by French anthropologist Marc Augé -- people relinquish their identity in locations where the only point is to simply pass through.

Klein invites viewers to stay in these transient spaces and reflect on the stressors of contemporary life. ""You cannot fully escape and fully disconnect from everything, but how can you (find) balance?"" she asked. In ""Proceed to the Route,"" she found her path by roaming into the unfamiliar. Perhaps we too can find fulfillment by deviating from the route.",Photographer Tania Franco Klein asks if we can ever truly disconnect,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tania-franco-klein-photographer/index.html,2019-12-13T12:11:43+00:00

Tokyo's new National Stadium was inaugurated Sunday, as Japan continues its countdown to the 2020 Summer Games

The newly completed venue was formally unveiled at a ceremony attended by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the renowned architect behind the project, Kengo Kuma.

Costing around 157 billion yen ($1.4 billion), the 68,000-seat stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies at both the Olympics and Paralympics. It will also be used for soccer matches and various track-and-field events during the Games.

The stadium's roof was constructed using steel and latticed wood. Credit: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images

Kuma, who is known for his use of natural materials, said he turned to traditional Japanese architecture and the environment for inspiration. His oval-shaped design features three tiers of seats beneath a partially covered roof made from steel and latticed wood.

The architect sourced more than 70,000 cubic feet of timber -- from each of the country's 47 prefectures -- for the stadium.

""The Olympics always becomes a symbol for the era, so with the 2020 Olympics, we wanted to create something that captures the people's thoughts on the environment or the Earth at the time,"" he told CNN in an interview in June. ""So, we thought that the best material for this era would be wood.""

More than 47,000 trees have been planted in the vicinity of the new stadium. Credit: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images

At Sunday's ceremony, Abe praised the design for achieving ""harmony with the surrounding environment and a Japanese character."" But as recently as 2015, the new National Stadium could have looked dramatically different.

A futuristic design by the late British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid had initially been selected, though Japan's Olympic organizers eventually scrapped the plan amid spiraling costs and high-profile criticisms. Celebrated architect Arata Isozaki described Hadid's design as a ""disgrace to future generations.""

The reins were then passed to 65-year-old Kuma, and he set about reimagining the project in his characteristically organic style. The architect said that his stadium design was partly inspired by Tokyo's Edo-period temples.

""All over the world, architecture in the 20th century that uses concrete and steel feels cold and stiff. I want to make it softer, kinder, warmer,"" said Kuma, whose firm designed the venue alongside architecture firm Azusa Sekkei. ""I think that's the kind of architecture that humans need, during this stressful era.""

The stadium has a capacity of 68,000. Credit: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images

His final design -- which replaces the existing National Stadium, built in the 1950s -- features large roof eaves that encourage air to circulate, allowing breeze to enter the stadium during hot weather. It is located in the Meijijingu Gaien park, which Kuma described as ""the greenest place in Tokyo.""

""Of course, we would like both athletes and spectators to enjoy the stadium, but at the same time we thought of something we can contribute to the community,"" Kuma said, highlighting the pedestrianized areas he designed around the structure. ""We've designed a place where everyone in the community can enjoy a walk there,"" he added.

The late switch of design meant that construction on the stadium did not begin until late 2016. As such, plans for the venue to host matches in the recent Rugby World Cup were canceled

Watch: Kengo Kuma on how buildings can create harmony

The venue will instead open to the public for the first time Saturday, with a launch event starring former sprinter Usain Bolt. It will then host a series of test events ahead of the Games, beginning with the final of Japan's Emperor's Cup soccer tournament on New Year's Day.

Ganvie is a town in the West African republic of Benin that rises out of the surface of a lake.

The sprawling grid that surrounds its clustered houses and public buildings is not filled with the typical urban asphalt parking lots and concrete mini-malls, but artificial reefs that operate as nurseries for fish and pens for indigenous aquaculture.

Ganvie's unusual environmental infrastructure is one of more than 100 ""nature-based technologies"" collected in a new book by landscape designer Julia Watson, titled ""Lo_TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism.""

The book describes cities, buildings and infrastructure from 20 countries including Iraq, Peru, the Philippines and Tanzania -- perhaps the world's best examples of ""Traditional Ecological Knowledge"" (TEK): techniques and technologies developed and incubated in indigenous societies.

""I think the central theme of the book is really questioning what we think of as technology and saying nature can be adapted and form a technology that we can apply to the way that we live in this world,"" said Watson, who teaches at Harvard's Graduate School of Design and Columbia University.

""All of them have been born out of people living in their environment, using what we call, in ecological sciences, 'symbiosis' as a fundamental process to which they build and live.""

These include bridges in northeastern India woven from living tree roots , which provide sustainable and flood resistant infrastructure while sequestering carbon and contributing to local forest cover.

Floating man-made islands in the Ma'dan, in southern Iraq, encourage the growth of diverse aquatic ecosystems while providing a resilient foundation for architecture.

And a low-density city on the southern foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro is home to a million people who live amid forest gardens of banana trees and coffee plants.

Most often -- as with Ganvie's fish pens and Kilimanjaro's banana gardens -- they produce food.

""At this very moment, probably the biggest impact that these system can have is decreasing the agricultural footprint of our cities by shifting the way that we understand productive land and (its) relationship with our cities -- folding that (agricultural production) into the way that we design cities,"" Watson said.

One of the most interesting examples of this can be seen in the East Kolkata Wetlands, the largest wastewater-fed aquaculture system in the world, covering 125 square kilometers (48 square miles).

On the edge of Kolkata, a city of 14 million people, we see a patchwork of fishponds, lagoons and channels, clustered around villages, rice paddies and fields.

""So it looks like a wetland but it's constructed,"" said Watson. Each day, 680 million liters of raw sewage, at least a third of the city's total waste, pours into pre-treatment ponds before entering the ""bheris,"" shallow fish ponds, dug by local people and cooperatives.

""And it processes it through a natural system, without the use of energy, without the use of chemicals, without an engineered, industrial wastewater treatment plant.

""The water coming out of that system is fresh or is clean water that will go back into the river system, not destroying ecosystems downstream. But it also produces food for the city. It produces vegetables for the city. There's a whole culture that has grown up around in relationship with this nature-based technology.""

Watson hopes these examples offer inspiration to today's city planners.

""That type of thinking is creating an innovation and a nature-based technology that can both shrink our agro-ecological footprint, carbon-sequester, flood-mitigate, produce culture, produce jobs and it's economically viable.

""It has so many benefits for our cities and it's free. It's a natural system. And it's driven by a sort of complex ecological relationship.""

In some cases, Watson sees such knowledge already integrated into contemporary city-building. The polder dike system that Dutch farmers have used for hundreds of years to drain wetlands for human habitation also underpins massive city-scale developments in China and across the world, she explained.

Watson sees her research as the beginning of a process by which these symbiotic systems could be developed to build the 21st century's cities. Consider terracing, she suggested, which in the Philippines has already turned mountain slopes almost as steep as skyscrapers into fertile fields.

A photo shows two women sitting in someone's teal-colored living room, drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and laughing uproariously at something off-camera.

It's not clear why, but they seem to be having a great time.

British filmmaker Lee Shulman says it's one of his favorite images in "" Midcentury Memories: The Anonymous Project ,"" a new book he curated that brings together 300 Kodachrome slides dating back to the 1950s.

""To me, the photo captures a moment of pure complicity and absolute freedom,"" Shulman said in a phone interview. ""You can sense the connection between the two women, and how carefree they are in that specific instant. It's almost uplifting.""

Kodachrome slides are rectangular pieces of color reversal film encased in cardboard that were loaded into slide projectors and beamed onto walls. The film itself was introduced by the Eastman Kodak Company in 1935, and it helped popularize photography among regular people after World War II.

Fine-grained and tonally rich, the film could record the hues of fabric and skin, atmosphere and light and, until electronic imaging became dominant, it was the way we captured moments on camera. In the early 1990s, home slides started falling out of fashion. In 2009, Kodak discontinued the iconic color film for good.

Since 2017, Shulman has collected over 700,000 Kodachrome slides as part of The Anonymous Project, a Paris-based non-profit initiative that gathers, scans, digitizes and catalogs color photographic negatives and slides produced since the mid-20th century. It's now one of the world's most extensive collections of amateur slides.

""Each slide is a glimpse into our collective memory,"" Shulman said.

Indeed, the photos -- all taken by amateurs, with varying degrees of photographic ability -- show situations familiar to most of us. There are pictures of newborn babies and first days of school, parties and family vacations, first dances and weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and older couples.

Throughout, there's a sense of normalcy -- and the feeling that we haven't greatly changed the way we document our lives.

""As can be seen in these pages, people behaved with 35-millimeter cameras and Instamatics 50 years ago much as they do today with smartphones in the age of Instagram and Snapchat,"" writes arts critic Richard B. Woodward in the book's introduction. ""They took pictures of what they ate and drank, where they vacationed, how they celebrated."" Just like we do today.

The filmmaker began collecting slides after buying a couple of 1950s Kodachrome boxes from eBay out of curiosity, and for very little money. When he opened them, he said he was ""stunned.""

""I was suddenly staring at hundreds of pictures of strangers' lives in super vivid colors, despite the fact that they were over 60 years old. It was mind-blowing. I felt like I had to do something with them other than just keep them to myself. The whole idea for The Anonymous Project snowballed from there.""

Although most of the color negatives remain vibrant, their shelf life is limited. Shulman said they aren't meant to survive longer than 50 years, as the chemicals on the film degrade over time -- which is why he's scanning as many as he can.

No captions, background information or specifics, like dates or times, accompany the frames, mostly because when Shulman acquired them they didn't come with any.

""Even in the rare instances I've had some access to the history of these snapshots, I decided to leave it out. For me, this is an interpretative experience,"" he said.

""It sounds cheesy, but I think these images really show how, even when we are so diverse, we still have similar ambitions, hopes, goals. And how we go through the same things. Looking at them is like realizing you're part of one big family.""

For the book, Shulman selected photos according to his own personal inclinations, choosing those that spoke to him emotionally or visually. The frame of the laughing ladies was one. Another ""favorite"" depicts a young woman intently staring at the camera, as someone -- her lover, Shulman speculates -- is taking her photo. She's serious, but there's a certain tenderness to her whole demeanor.

The filmmaker applies that same subjective approach to The Anonymous Project's website and exhibitions, especially as the collection continues to expand.

Shulman said people from all over the world have sent him boxes of old Kodachrome slides, some of which have been forgotten for years in their attics.

""We have such a vast range of images now,"" he explained. ""Some resonate with me at certain times, some at others. So what the public see changes often.""

While ""Midcentury Memories"" finally publishes the images in book form, there may be much more to come from the project. ""There's a strong interest from people in exploring our collective memory,"" Shulman said. ""Today more than ever. I only see this taking on new directions, but never really stopping.""",Why Kodachrome was the Instagram of its time,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/mid-century-memories-kodachrome/index.html,2019-12-06T01:43:46+00:00

Street photography can be many things. It can be a record of a specific place in time, a witness to political and social events, or a reflection of pop culture, trends and fads. Often, it's simply the most honest, unadulterated way of capturing people's daily lives.

The new book ""Magnum Streetwise"" explores each of these facets, tracing the evolution of the genre as recorded by Magnum Photos, the international cooperative of photojournalists whose founders include two of the forefathers of modern street photography, Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson.

Recently published by Thames & Hudson, and edited by photographer and curator Stephen McLaren, the book includes over 300 images from some of street photography's greatest practitioners, from the 1930s to the present day -- Elliott Erwitt, Martine Franck, Bruce Gilden, Steve McCurry and Susan Meiselas, among others.

""Street photography is still the lifeblood of Magnum,"" McLaren said in a phone interview. ""The book is a homage to the people that made it so.""

Thirty photographers have their own dedicated chapter, with highlights from their portfolios accompanied by quotes or essays, while some 30 more are curated under sections titled In Transit, Days Off and Playing the Market.

In Transit, for instance, includes images of rain-drenched cyclists in Shanghai, shot by Stuart Franklin in 1993, and Thomas Dworzak's 2000 photo of a man driving away from a petrol station in Azerbajian with dozens of plastic containers strapped to the roof of his car.

Days Off, meanwhile, shows kids playing volleyball in Havana, Cuba, by Paolo Pellegrin in 2011, but also punks, immortalized by Peter Marlow at a 1978 gig at the Roxy Club in London.

Four cities central to the history of street photography -- London, New York, Paris and Tokyo -- where Magnum has long had offices, also serve as sub-dividers for the visual artists. The idea, McLaren explained, was to illustrate the wealth of styles, techniques and approaches applied to different subjects by different masters, as well as each city's distinctive visual traits.

""Street photography is so incredibly layered,"" McLaren said. ""It's possibly the most candid visual representation of the world around us.""

The ""streetwise"" of the title hints at the photographers' ability to ""paint"" a picture by being acutely aware of their surroundings and capturing it in a single moment.

""Streetwise photographers are instinctive readers of body language,"" McLaren writes in the introduction of the book. ""They can sense when someone is about to yawn while waiting to cross the road, and they revel in the rituals of a group of friends sitting together on a night out.

""To be able to approach such a scene, unobtrusively get within camera range and take one or two frames, and then depart leaving the subjects untroubled and the location untouched is akin to being a cat burglar. To pull this off is to be a master of distraction.""

Being able to sense ""that moment when reality quivers with photographic possibility,"" is also what makes the featured Magnum photographers streetwise, McLaren points out.

""Unlike photojournalism, which involves a very strict way of telling stories, permits and so on, street photography is more instinctual, and almost allows for more artistic leeway,"" he explained. ""These images all share that quality.""

The photos in ""Magnum Streetwise"" tell diverse micro-stories specific to their authors and settings -- for example, a girl on Tokyo's metro, captured by Gueorgui Pinkhassov in 1996 and pigeons scattering over Trafalgar Square in London, by Sergio Larrain circa 1958.

Others are extended works of observation, like Herbert List's contemplation of the limited view from his window in the summer of 1953 in Rome, when a foot injury kept him confined to his apartment.

""Video, VR and new technologies are increasingly shaping the way we approach and digest what's around us,"" McLaren said, ""but street photography is shrouded in a sense of mystery hard to replicate. And it's still very much a relevant expression of how the world works.""

""Street pictures don't give out or tell you what you're seeing. They make you ask questions, and ask yourself 'What happening here?' They suggest that not everything is as it might seem.""",Magnum Photos: The spontaneous art of street photography,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/magnum-street-photography-stephen-mclaren/index.html,2019-12-02T04:28:26+00:00

For the last decade, Thomas Sauvin has been purchasing discarded color negatives by the kilogram from a recycling plant outside Beijing. The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.

The trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.

Quite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.

His ongoing ""Beijing Silvermine"" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.

""The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,"" he said in a phone interview. ""There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.""

While the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half ""looking for gems,"" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.

Most of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.

The pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.

""I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,"" Sauvin said. ""You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.

""But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.""

Recurring themes

What remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls ""the ritual"" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.

Some common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.

New ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (""Go around the world in just one day,"" its catalog boasted).

What initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.

""It seems to be quite a meaningful place,"" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. ""It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.""

Fading memories

Sauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.

The image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (""like a mermaid,"" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he ""knew the guy like he was my grandfather.""

After Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.

""He was very happy, and we had a very good time,"" Sauvin said. ""In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'""

Although now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a ""still very reasonable"" 75 yuan (just under $11).

""It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,"" he said. ""But that's part of the game, I suppose.""

The supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.

""I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,"" Sauvin recalled. ""And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'""

He took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.

Further investigation revealed that the pictures had been taken by the photography department at Xi'an Physical Education University, in China's Shaanxi province. All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.

""I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,"" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, ""Great Leaps Forward.""

""The photos were simply beautiful -- very calm, very poetic. The athletes seemed to overcome gravity,""",Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/china-beijing-silvermine-negatives/index.html,2019-11-15T04:32:08+00:00

It isn't unusual for a Hollywood native like Randall Slavin to grow up wanting to be an actor.

But hanging out with promising young stars steered Slavin in a different direction: photography.

During the 1990s, armed with an Olympus Stylus camera, he became the visual chronicler of Hollywood's young celebrities -- the last pre-internet generation of musicians and actors, like Hilary Swank and Charlize Theron, who at that time were still trying to make it in the business.

The magic of soul and funk in the seventies

""I think I was hyper aware that I was around special people,"" Slavin wrote in his book, ""We all want something beautiful.""

The book charts Slavin's career, from candid photos of his on-the-verge-of-stardom friends to his latest glossy works, revealing his aptitude for capturing unguarded emotion. Each page is filled with familiar faces, like Lindsay Lohan, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Garner, Amber Heard, Rose McGowan and Tara Reid.

""One of my main focuses is to get people to forget they're being photographed, because that's what makes people feel stiff,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It's a joy to spend some time with these legends, so I want to use the time I have to get to know them... I like to talk a lot during my shoots.""

Born and raised in LA, Slavin had wanted to become an actor. He compared Hollywood to Pachinko, a Japanese game that resembles a pinball machine: ""Everyone comes (here) wanting to be an actor and then they slowly filter down and find their slot.""

During the 1990s, he had minor roles in blockbuster films, like ""Primal Fear"" and ""Legends of the Fall,"" but to support his acting dreams Slavin needed other side gigs. In his early 20s, he was working at a Chevron gas station in La Cienega, in Hollywood, when he decided to try his hand at taking photos.

He befriended the owner of a headshot photography studio across the street, who gave him some basic pointers, and soon after he was taking headshots of his friends -- including Hilary Swank, who, in one picture, had just chopped her hair off to express contempt for having been fired from the hit TV show ""Beverly Hills 90210.""

""I was very fortunate that a lot of my friends... let me experiment on them, and it helped when they blew up and became movie stars. I certainly had a leg up on a lot of other photographers who were starting out,"" Slavin said.

The first celebrity portrait he took was of The Black Crowes' lead singer Chris Robinson at his ""hippie paradise in the hills above Sunset Boulevard,"" and Charlize Theron, a longtime friend, once invited him to tag along and document a trip to South Africa.

""I was breathing rarefied air, and I wanted to remember every single moment,"" Slavin wrote in the book.

With his camera in hand, Slavin seemed to be in all the right places at the right time. He captured an image of Leonardo DiCaprio -- right before the film ""Titanic"" was released -- hanging out with Theron at her birthday party in Hollywood's iconic Bar Marmont.

""You had these incredible places with people relaxing and letting their hair down,"" he explained. ""I don't know if that happens anymore.""

Going through his archive, Slavin also found a few surprising faces: ""Six years before his breakthrough in 'Hustle and Flow,' Terrence (Howard) was at my birthday party. I didn't know him. I just held the camera aloft to get a shot. Years later I looked at the picture and realized he was looking directly into the camera,"" Slavin wrote in ""We all want something beautiful.""

Social media has kicked the doors of Hollywood wide open, but Slavin's photos give insight into a time when celebrities could party in relative privacy.

Actor James Van Der Beek appears in the background of one photo, wearing a beard, glasses and a baseball cap. It was 1999 and he'd already shot to fame as Dawson Leery in ""Dawson's Creek.""

""Everything about it says, 'Pay no attention to the confused boy in the too-baggy jacket,'"" Van Der Beek said in an Instagram post, noting that Slavin's images captured a time before everyone carried a camera in their pockets.

Slavin agreed. ""Everybody thinks their 20s were a special time, but I also think it was a special time because it was right before the internet, social media and cellphones. Those three things came along and privacy went out the window,"" he said.

It isn't easy to make it in Hollywood as an actor but it's equally hard to start out as a photographer.

In Slavin's case, his craft was given a boost by an all-access pass to the life of his Hollywood friends. But he wasn't driven by dreams of exposure. Slavin's early black and white images were simply intended as a visual diary of the great times they were all living.

""I was very fortunate to be at the right place in some very magical times,"" he said.

LA feels enormous but when you're here it's a small town, a small little company town, and everybody works for the same factory.""

Steve McCurry has achieved legendary status with his documentary photography, and is perhaps best known for his portrait of the ""Afghan Girl"" with the piercing green eyes published in 1985.

But the influential American photographer, who has built his career around his daring coverage of armed conflict, has a lesser known passion: animals.

They are the subject of a new book simply called ""Steve McCurry. Animals,"" published by Taschen.

The book compiles the photographer's favorite photos, from cats in Myanmar to camels in Jordan.

""Animals are one of my favorite subjects to shoot; they are completely unpredictable,"" said McCurry in an email.

""Animals are in constant motion, have a mind of their own and rarely pay any attention to directions from a photographer. Understanding animal behavior is essential to making good animal photographs, just as understanding human behavior can help with taking someone's portrait,"" he said.

by Elliott Erwitt, titled "" The idea of photographing animals and people has been on McCurry's mind since he started out as a young photographer. His sister gifted him his first photo book, a collection of pictures of dogs and their ownersby Elliott Erwitt, titled "" Son of Bitch .""

""It was the first time I saw a book on animals with humor, pathos and wonderful storytelling,"" he said.

The images in McCurry's new book take readers on a visual journey from Asia to South America, North America and Europe. Many of the photos include human subjects, but those that don't hint at the presence of humans, or at least what they've left behind.

One of the most striking shots, winner of the 1992 World Press Photo award , was taken in Kuwait at the end of the first Gulf War. It shows three camels looking for food and water while a massive fire rages in the background. Former Iraq president Saddam Hussein had ordered his soldiers to set oil fields alight, creating an ecological disaster.

""Working in Kuwait in the aftermath of the first Gulf War was a surreal and unforgettable experience,"" said McCurry. ""There were 600 oil fields burning, panicked and starved animals were wandering about, and the landscape was dotted with dead Iraqi soldiers.

""It was heartbreaking to see these animals, which we were supposed to be guardians of. Those animals that escaped slaughter were abandoned and left to wander the streets looking for food and shelter.""

McCurry's collection extends far beyond war zones, to designer dogs in Beverly Hills, race horses in Hong Kong and goats in northern Pakistan.

One he particularly likes is that of a novice monk studying Buddhist writings in the late afternoon at a monastery in Aranyaprathet, Thailand, near the border with Cambodia.

""I watched the changing light as the monks went about both the mundane and sacred duties of their day. With the simple use of wood and fabric, of shades of saffron from mustard gold to deep orange, their environment was serene. The patient cat completed the scene of contemplation and peace,"" he said.

The wide range of countries and cultures represented in the images reflect different cultural attitudes towards animals and pets.

""Many of us believe that dogs are man's best friends, but in some cultures they are viewed as dirty and unclean. In other cultures, dogs are even a delicacy,"" McCurry said.

What it's like to document a 'minor miracle'

""Cows are sacred in India, but in other parts of the world, beef symbolizes pride in their cattle industry. These disparities are often difficult to understand, but it is important to understand the sensibility and sensitivities in each geographic region, in order to have a full understanding of the local culture.""

McCurry hopes, too, that his images will inspire a greater respect for animals, and a desire to address the dire predictions of mass extinction caused by human activity.

""This is an unimaginable catastrophe, but one that is sadly coming to fruition. We are losing species every year; wildlife is being decimated to the point where in a few years some species will cease to exist in their natural habitats.""

His comments about the climate crisis suggest a certain exasperation about the lack of action by governments worldwide to address the problem. He believes inaction on climate will lead to other alarming consequences for both people and animals.

""The warming climate is a major driver that is exacerbating the effects of overfishing, widespread pesticide use, pollution and urban expansion into the natural world,"" he said.

The book contains almost no text. The large images are only captioned with the place and date, and rarely interspersed with quotes from the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson, Immanuel Kant and William Shakespeare. Only at the end of the book readers can find a more detailed caption for each image with a few words on its background.

""I think people see a picture and make up their own story, a fantasy about the meaning of the image,"" explained McCurry.

""And sometimes their own interpretation is actually more interesting than the actual story.""

“Spoiler alert, season 2 is on the way, so in the end he obviously didn’t kill himself – just like Jeffrey Epstein,” said Gervais, before adding, “Shut up, I know he’s your friend but I don’t care, you had to make your own way here in your own plane didn’t you?”

In another quip, Gervais slammed actors for calling themselves “woke” while taking money from Apple, Amazon and Disney, who use slave labor.

“If ISIS started a streaming service, you’d call your agent,” joked Gervais.

“If you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech. You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God and fuck off,” he added.

Will Gervais be invited back again after this? Unlikely.

On Friday, Biden doubled down on his lie during a brief exchange with Fox News:

“As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you could stop an imminent attack on Americans — but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terrorist leader — would you pull the trigger?” Biden was asked.

To which Biden replied “Well we did – the guy’s name was Osama bin Laden.”

“Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden that day?” Fox followed up.

“No, I didn’t,” Biden replied.

Joe Biden is now trying to cover up his opposition to the Osama bin Laden raid. Moments ago, Biden says, ""No I didn't"" when confronted by Peter Doocy for being against the raid. 8 years ago, Biden said he opposed raid and told Obama, “Mr. President, my suggestion is don’t go.” pic.twitter.com/zAWhMf38MU — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) January 3, 2020

On Friday, the Republican National Committee (RNC) slammed Biden over Friday’s claim, according to Fox News.

“This isn’t another instance of Joe Biden misspeaking, it’s an instance of Biden flat-out lying,” said spokesman Steve Guest.

"Joe Biden can’t seem to get his story straight regarding the 2011 Bin Laden raid, in which a team of SEALs stormed into the terrorist leader’s Pakistan compound, killed him, then dumped the body in the ocean in accordance with Islamic principles.

Eight years ago, Biden told a group of congressional Democrats he was against the bin Laden raid, saying: “Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go — we have to do two more things to see if he’s there.”

"Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and former lover of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, is reportedly under guarded protection by former U.S. Navy SEALs over “credible death threats,” according to reports.

A source told The Daily Mail that the 58-year-old alleged Epstein madam is being transported from one safe house to the next amid concerns that she may be killed so as not to disclose the elite’s sordid secrets allegedly collected on behalf of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.

“There has been so much rubbish written about Ghislaine. The reality is she receives multiple, credible death threats on a daily basis,” the source said. “The hate mail is sometimes 2 [feet] high.”

“She is constantly moving. Her life is in danger. She is being guarded by the best of the very best and that includes former U.S. Navy SEALs. She’s not under the protection of any government. She’s on her own.”

The reports come amid uncertainty over Maxwell’s whereabouts.

A former associate of Maxwell, Laura Goldman, said earlier this week that Maxwell is convinced she’ll escape any criminal convictions given the nature of the dirt she has on other powerful people.

“Ghislaine and her sister Isabel remain totally convinced that she’ll escape any criminal convictions and will eventually clear the family name and return to high society once the dust has settled,” Goldman told The Sun on Tuesday.

“She has wealthy connections who hide her and even pay some legal fees. She can stay out of the public eye as long as she wants.”

“She obviously has some serious dirt on someone to be so sure of herself in the circumstances,” Goldman added.

However, Spencer Kuvin, the lawyer representing several of Epstein’s victims claims the FBI is aware of her location and is building a case against her.

“I think ultimately they are building a case and know where she is and they’re just not letting on, much like they did with Mr Epstein, who, when he stepped foot in the US, they just arrested him,” Kuvin said last month. “Nobody knew that, they didn’t broadcast it, they didn’t tell anyone he was traveling here, they just did it.”

“Anytime she travels, the federal government is going to know where she is because there are flight logs required for every type of travel, whether it’s private jet or commercial, the federal government, through the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], has flight logs and international organizations also have flight logs.”

"CNN host Erin Burnett threw softballs at Iran’s UN representative during a friendly anti-Trump interview on Friday night.

Burnett began by asking Ambassador of Iran to the United Nations Majid Ravanchi whether he thought President Trump was telling the truth about his motives in targeting General Qassam Soleimani last week.

“So President Trump says he is not looking for regime change in Iran,” Burnett said. “He also said that today, do you believe him on that? Obviously, John Bolton, the former National Security adviser, said the opposite, as he has said many times before, but when President Trump says this is not about regime change, is he telling the truth?”

What matters is the U.S. deeds, not the words,” Ravanchi responded. “What they are doing against the Iranians are exactly to put lots of pressure on the Iranian people to stand up, and that is contravention of U.S. obligations based on international law.”

Burnett then tried to frame a moral moral equivalence between Soleimani, a known terrorist plotter, and Vice President Mike Pence, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“Americans can understand though what the reaction would be, if someone that influential were killed here or killed in another country, but someone who was let’s say, the Chief of the C.I.A., the Defense Secretary or even a Vice President. Does this death change the game completely between Iran and the United States?” Burnett asked.

If CNN was this friendly to the Trump administration as it was with Iran’s PR, perhaps its ratings wouldn’t be at record lows.

Journalist David Marcus of the Federalist condemned the softball interview, calling it “journalistic malpractice at best” for not even asking about Iran’s numerous military actions against the U.S. in recent months.

How on earth can one interview the Iranian ambassador without asking about Iranian support for a violent attack on an American embassy last week? Or how about an attack on a base that left an American contractor dead? Or the shooting down of an American drone over international waters?

Time and again in the interview Ravanchi claimed that by killing Soleimani the US had moved from an economic war (pulling out of the Iran Deal) to a military war. But Iran has engaged in military actions against America and American interest for months now. The network that fatuously insists they are all about the facts allowed the ambassador to flat out lie to the their viewers without the least bit of resistance.

This is simply journalistic malpractice at best. At worst, it is giving comfort to an enemy dedicated to the destruction of the United States (Death to America) by handing over the CNN platform for the pushing of propaganda, including failing to mention at all the Iranian regime’s brutal and murderous crackdown on protesters in its own country last month.

"The Iranian information minister issued a toughly worded response to US President Donald Trump after he posted a threatening tweet about “targeting” dozens of sites across Iran.

“Trump is a ‘terrorist in a suit’. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat ‘the Great Iranian Nation & Culture,'” Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi tweeted on Sunday, while also comparing the US president to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), Adolf Hitler and Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan.

The minister was responding to an earlier tweet by Trump, in which he warned that the US has “targeted 52 Iranian sites,” including those important to “the Iranian culture,” that will be hit if Tehran attacks American citizens or assets.

Like ISIS, like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a ""terrorist in a suit"". He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat ""the Great Iranian Nation & Culture"".#HardRevenge#QasemSoleimani https://t.co/N2iQ5AMX7M — MJ Azari Jahromi (@azarijahromi) January 5, 2020

Iran’s army chief, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, rebuffed the warning, however, saying it is “unlikely that the US would have what it takes to carry out its threat.”

Meanwhile, Tehran summoned the Swiss envoy to the Islamic Republic to protest Trump’s hostile remarks. Such aggressive language is “completely unacceptable and violates international law,” the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. Swiss diplomats act as intermediaries between Tehran and Washington, because the countries cut formal ties in 1980.

Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated dramatically in recent weeks. On December 27, dozens of rockets hit K-1 Air Base in Iraq, killing an American civilian contractor and wounding several servicemen. Washington blamed Iran-backed Shia group Kataib Hezbollah for the attack, and conducted airstrikes on its sites in Iraq and Syria.

In response to the raids, the group’s members and supporters staged a large protest outside the US embassy in Baghdad, which ended with the protesters breaking into the compound and partially setting it on fire.

On Friday morning, a US drone strike killed the chief of Iran’s Quds Force – an elite unit tasked with operations abroad – Major General Qassem Soleimani. The attack also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of the Iran-backed Shia militia, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF).

Tehran has harshly condemned the raid, while the US claims that Soleimani’s death prevented several major terrorist attacks against American nationals. The Islamic Republic’s envoy to the United Nations has asked the UN Security Council to condemn the “horrific assassination” of the Quds Force leader.

"The reports emerge as the US-led coalition fighting Daesh* in Iraq has said that it has suspended its fight against the terror group amid increased attacks on US personnel.

The Iraqi Parliament has passed a resolution to demand the termination of all the foreign troop presence in the country, Sky News Arabia broadcaster reported.

During an extraordinary session convened on Sunday, the legislative body also voted to terminate the agreement with the US-led coalition fighting Daesh.

“The government commits to revoke its request for assistance from the international coalition fighting Islamic State due to the end of military operations in Iraq and the achievement of victory,” the resolution read. “The Iraqi government must work to end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, airspace or water for any reason.”

Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi earlier requested that parliament order the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, Sky News Arabia broadcaster reported, as Iraq’s parliament began its extraordinary session.

The Prime Minister said that both Iraq and the US are interested in terminating the foreign troop presence in the country.

The head of the Iraqi government believes that the foreign troop pullout would be beneficial to the country. He also recalled that US-Iraqi relations did not suffer despite the absence of foreign troops in the country in the period 2011-2014.

“Despite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,” Abdul Mahdi told parliament in a speech.

He added that there are two options available regarding the withdrawal of US-led coalition troops. The first would see their immediate and complete withdrawal, the second would order foreign military personnel to leave gradually.

“As Prime Minister and senior commander, I recommend the first option. Despite the external and internal difficulties that we may encounter, this option is fundamentally better for Iraq … It will help reorganise relations with the US and other nations, maintain cordial relations on the basis that territorial sovereignty is respected, and allows for no interference in internal affairs,” Mahdi remarked.

Hezbollah Leader on US Troops in the Region

Echoing the Prime Minister’s words, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that the end of the US troop presence in the region, including military bases, navy ships and military personnel would be a fair punishment for Soleimani’s killing.

Nasrallah specified that this measure should not include civilians in the country as the punishment should be directed at the institution that implemented the killing of Soleimani.

Soleimani’s Killing

Abdul Mahdi also said that the United States informed Iraq about the plans to target the commander several minutes before the attack. He added that the Iraqi authorities gave no such permission.

The Prime Minister revealed that he was scheduled to meet with Soleimani the same morning the general was killed in an airstrike in Baghdad. According to Abdul Mahdi, the Iranian general was expected to deliver a response from Iran to ‘a Saudi message’.

In the early hours of Friday, Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of an Iraqi Shia militia group, were among those killed by a US drone attack near Baghdad International Airport. Soleimani and al-Muhandis were blamed by Washington for organising demonstrations at the US Embassy in Baghdad on 31 December.

US President Donald Trump said the recent strikes were a preemptive, defensive move to prevent war. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned that Tehran will take revenge for what it views to be a heinous crime.

Alex Jones breaks down in this exclusive video why President Trump ordered the targeted killing of Iran’s top military commander General Qassam Soleimani and how it actually thwarted the globalist plot to spark World War III.

"Following today’s mortar attacks, and bellicosity from various Iranian (and Iran-backed) leaders, President Trump has responded in words (for now), warning Iran in three short words: “no more threats!”

In three short tweets, Trump explained he is done being threatened…

“Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader”

Then reminded his followers just exactly what Soleimani had done…

“[Soleimani] had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years.”

Then came the warning:

“Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!“

Not quite as aggressive as the “fire and fury” tweet directed at North Korea, but with the red flag of jihad flying in Iran, we suspect they get the message from the US president.

Of course, as Politico’s Rym Momtaz explained earlier, no one knows for sure what happens next, even those who will decide some of the next steps.

The Iranian regime is not suicidal, it is strategic, calculating (even if it miscalculates sometimes), so likelihood of an all-out direct US-Iran war is low. Khamenei promised response, it must be strong enough to save face internally, for a regime already strained + facing popular dissent, and also be calibrated to avoid provoking a US response inside Iran. Iran’s response will show whether deterrence restored. The myth of invincibility that Iran built around Soleimani was a huge recruitment tool, it may also now turn out to be a double-edged sword. How does its most valiant warrior, its most effective US challenger, get picked off so precisely by the US? Concern for US military, diplo personnel, and citizens, in the region is legit. But allowing it to dictate policy plays into Iran’s hands which weaponises Western sensitivity to human loss, and war weariness, to further destabilise the region unchecked. There are many so-called anti-imperialists who always criticise Western intervention but justify Iranian/Russian intervention. Iran is not a legit actor in Iraq/Syria/Leb/Yemen. Its crimes there are no less reprehensible than those by the US or colonialists. Iran is set to announce its next violations of the JCPOA in next few days. That’s another thing to look out for, other than a military retaliation, in wake of the Soleimani killing. Will it escalate to the point of affecting break-out time or not?

"Following today’s mortar attacks, and bellicosity from various Iranian (and Iran-backed) leaders, President Trump has responded in words (for now), warning Iran in three short words: “no more threats!”

In three short tweets, Trump explained he is done being threatened…

“Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader”

Then reminded his followers just exactly what Soleimani had done…

“[Soleimani] had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years.”

Then came the warning:

“Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.

"President Trump’s drone strike that killed a top Iranian commander at Baghdad International Airport on Friday has sparked concern among many Americans that the government could reinstate the draft ahead of a possible military conflict with Iran.

The Selective Service System website crashed on Friday after a surge in traffic was seen following the killing of Iranian General Qasem Suleimani.

Google searches for “military draft age,” “iran,” “world war 3,” “us draft,” “draft exemption,” “draft requirements,” and “is there a ww3” spiked around 10 am est. Friday and have been elevated ever since.

Hashtags such as #WWIII, #WorldWarThree, #WW3Memes and #WorldWarThreeDraft have been trending on Twitter in the last 24-hours.

The US sending upwards of 3,500 additional troops to military bases that surround Iran has also increased the hysteria – as many Americans now believe a war with Iran could be imminent.

Bloomberg noted that the Selective Service System website went down on Friday after high traffic volumes were seen. The agency said, “Due to the spread of misinformation, our website is experiencing high traffic volumes at this time.

"Protesters took to the streets of Washington and other US cities on Saturday to condemn the air strike in Iraq ordered by President Donald Trump that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and Trump’s decision to send about 3,000 more troops to the Middle East.

“No justice, no peace. US out of the Middle East,” hundreds of demonstrators chanted outside the White House before marching to the Trump International Hotel a few blocks away, Reuters said.

More than 70 protests across the country were planned for Saturday, many organised by Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), a US-based anti-war coalition, in cooperation with more than a dozen other such groups including Code Pink, The Hill said on its website. Protesters demonstrated outside the White House, in New York’s Times Square, at Trump Tower in Chicago and at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, among other locations.

President Donald Trump’s new immigration judges are far more likely to reject migrants’ requests for asylum than are the judges prior presidents picked.

Four Trump immigration judges in Memphis, Tennessee, denied more than 90 percent of claims from migrants, while the prior judges granted roughly half of the requests, according to a study by immigration lawyer Lily Axelrod.

There are 465 immigration judges, some of whom stay on the bench for decades. But Trump’s pro-American policies are frustrating judges who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, prompting some to leave and open new slots for Trump-appointed judges. In 2019, 45 judges quit, compared to 24 judges who retired in 2018.

“For 24 years, [Judge Lisa Dornell] sat on the bench in Baltimore’s immigration court, hearing hundreds of cases of immigrants trying to stay in the United States,” CNN reported on December 27. “It was a privilege to be able to preside over so many different cases and be able to grant relief to people who needed relief,” Dornell told CNN in an interview about the rising number of retiring judges. The article added:

"Authorities in Hong Kong have activated a recently created “serious response” threat level Saturday as a mysterious SARS-like respiratory illness begins to spread throughout central China, according to AP.

While just 44 people have been admitted to the hospital with the unidentified virus – eleven of them in serious condition, authorities in Wuhan, China have put 121 people under observation who have been in close contact with the infected. Five cases, meanwhile, have been reported in Shanghai – around 570 miles north of Hong Kong.

A Wuhan government official told SCMP that his wife, a nurse in the infectious disease unit at the Central Hospital, has been unable to go home for the past several days because her ward has been on “lockdown.”

“My kids and I can still call her on her mobile,” he said, adding “[But] we are very worried for her, although she said all is fine.”

Five possible cases have been reported of a viral pneumonia that has also infected at least 44 people in Wuhan, an inland city west of Shanghai, about 900 kilometers (570 miles) north of Hong Kong. The outbreak, which emerged last month, has revived memories of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere. –AP

The most common symptom of the new disease is fever, shortness of breath and lung infections. Method of transmission / infection is unknown. Investigations have ruled out bird flu and the common flu, as well as adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases. Further laboratory tests are ongoing according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

Hong Kong’s ‘serious response’ level is the second highest in a newly-launched three-tier system unveiled Saturday, designed to respond to infectious diseases of unknown origin.

On Friday, the city’s health department activated a thermal imaging system at Hong Kong’s airport to check the body temperature of arriving passengers, while the staff at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station which connects Hong Kong and the mainland have been ordered to undergo temperature checks.

During a Friday visit to the train station, city leader Carrie Lam urged any travelers with respiratory systems to don surgical masks and seek immediate medical attention – telling doctors where they’ve been.

According to Oxford University visiting professor to the University of Hong Kong, Dr. Emily Chan Ying-yang, the sudden rise in cases in Wuhan is “not alarming,” but raises concerns that it may be a new strain.

“If it were Sars [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], we are experienced in managing it,” she said. “But if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention.”

“The scariest thing with Sars is its fatality rate, and that young people died. We don’t know whether the serious cases in Wuhan are young or old people – that deserves attention.”

According to SCMP, Ying-yang says it’s important for authorities to be transparent with people, as large numbers of people will be traveling throughout China for the Lunar New Year in late January.

Professor Jiang Rongmeng, of Ditan Hospital in Beijing, one of China’s top centres for treating infectious diseases, said the rise in infections was probably a consequence of active detection and reporting of unexplained pneumonia cases. “No apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far, otherwise there would have been a community outbreak with more infections,” he said. –SCMP

The outbreak was first reported among stallholders at the city’s Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market – which also sells live animals including birds and rabbits.",Hong Kong Activates “Serious Response” As Chinese Mystery Illness Prompts Hospital Lockdown,https://www.infowars.com/hong-kong-activates-serious-response-as-chinese-mystery-illness-prompts-hospital-lockdown/,2020-01-05T06:41:36-06:00

According to SCMP, Ying-yang says it’s important for authorities to be transparent with people, as large numbers of people will be traveling throughout China for the Lunar New Year in late January.

Professor Jiang Rongmeng, of Ditan Hospital in Beijing, one of China’s top centres for treating infectious diseases, said the rise in infections was probably a consequence of active detection and reporting of unexplained pneumonia cases. “No apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far, otherwise there would have been a community outbreak with more infections,” he said. –SCMP

"The Iranian regime has raised a red flag over the dome of the Jamkarān Mosque in Qom, Iran’s holiest city, as an apparent warning to America of impending retaliation for the airstrike that killed the regime’s top military general Qassam Soleimani.

The move is seen as unprecedented, as the red flag has reportedly never been flown over the Jamkarān Mosque.

“Very very unusual to see a red flag flying over holy mosque of Jamkaran in Qom, Iran‘s holiest city,” tweeted NBC News Tehran Bureau Chief Ali Arouzi. “It’s is almost always blue. The red flag symbolises revenge.”

Iran’s leadership stated earlier this week that the U.S. would suffer consequences for killing Soleimani, with General Gholamali Abuhamzeh warning of possible retaliation in the Strait of Hormuz.

“The Strait of Hormuz is a vital point for the West and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross there … vital American targets in the region have been identified by Iran since long time ago … some 35 U.S. targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach,” he said.

Likewise, former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell warned that Iran would kill American civilians to avenge the “evil genius” Soleimani.

“Number one, there will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans, as a result of this,” he said. “Possibly over the next few days in any place where Iran has its proxies, Iraq is the most likely place, but also Lebanon, Bahrain, other places in the Middle East.”

President Trump ordered a U.S. military attack that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force, among other military officials at Baghdad International Airport early Friday, the Pentagon confirmed. Friday’s Baghdad strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, a source told Fox News.

"Iran reserves the right to avenge the US’ killing of Major General Qassem Soleimani, with dozens of potential targets already on the list, a senior commander within the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says.

“Vital American targets in the region have been identified by Iran a long time ago,” General Gholamali Abuhamzeh, who leads the IRGC in Iran’s southern Kerman Province, said on Friday evening, as quoted by Tasnim News Agency.

“35 US targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach.”

The commander did not name any specific targets but mentioned that US warships have been operating in the Strait of Hormuz, an important shipping route, which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean.

Abuhamzeh made the comments after Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC’s Quds Force – a special unit tasked with operations abroad – was killed in a US drone strike at a Baghdad airport. He died along with several high-ranking officials from the Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militias, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF).

Kerman is Soleimani’s home province. He is expected to be buried there on Sunday.

Killing the Quds leader was the “biggest strategic mistake” the US has made in its four decades of standoff with Iran, Abuhamzeh said, promising that Tehran will “exact revenge.”

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed that Iran “does not seek tensions in the region.”

However, “the presence and interference of the foreign and extra-regional forces have caused instability, insecurity and escalation of tensions,” Zarif said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, in Tehran.

Officials in Washington say that Soleimani’s death has prevented major terrorist attacks against the US and saved “hundreds” of American lives. US President Donald Trump has gone as far as calling Soleimani the “number one terrorist in the world,” ignoring the fact that the general played a key role in the defeat of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Syria and Iraq.

In this high-energy breakdown Alex Jones exposes the true motives of Trump’s surgical strike that took out Qassem Soleimani and what this means for the future of America and the Middle East.

"While police say she is co-operating with the investigation into the crimes of disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell has dropped out of the public eye and has not been seen for several months.

The UK’s Duke of York Prince Andrew ‘begged’ billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to defend him publicly but she refused, according to an anonymous source speaking to the New York Post.

The source told NYP’s Page Six on Monday that Britain’s Prince Andrew begged Maxwell, who was Epstein’s alleged ‘madam’, to give an interview to protect his name and reputation after being accused by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claimed she had been trafficked to London to have sex with the Duke of York.

The 58-year old Maxwell allegedly refused his plea and the prince subsequently conducted his own sit-down interview with the BBC.

“Andrew pleaded with Ghislaine to publicly defend him. She carefully considered it, but decided no good would come of it (if she came forward). It isn’t in her best interests,” the source said.

The source also claimed: “If the US government was really interested in bringing in Ghislaine, the IRS would have looked at her tax returns and the income she may have got from Epstein and perhaps some of his powerful associates”.

“Ghislaine is protected. She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments. They would trade information about the powerful people caught in his net — caught at Epstein’s house”.

On Maxwell’s whereabouts, the source added that she went into hiding following the arrest and later alleged suicide of Epstein in his cell.

“She is not in the US”, they claimed, despite having homes in both Manhattan and London.

“She moves around. She is sometimes in the UK, but most often in other countries, such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.”

Prince Andrew’s accuser, Giuffre launched a lawsuit accusing Maxwell of being “actively” involved in luring young girls for sex with Epstein.

She claims that she first met Maxwell when she was 16 or 17 in 2000 while working as a towel girl at Mar-a-Lago, eventually being flown around in Epstein’s “Lolita Express” before sleeping with Prince Andrew in 2001.

Following his rearrest, Epstein was found dead in August in his cell while awaiting trial for sex trafficking and paedophilia charges. New York City’s medical examiner ruled the death a suicide, but his lawyers are contesting that conclusion.

The 66-year old billionaire’s death came around a month being charged with trafficking scores of underage girls, some as young as 14 between 2002 and 2005.

Leo Zagami joins Savanah, Becca, and Owen to discuss the breaking news about the now disgraced Prince Andrew after he was kicked out of Buckingham palace due to his connections with Jeffery Epstein.

The actual origin of that video appears to have been a largely unknown Twitter user going by “Mo_Allamy” whose profile lists his location as “Germany.”

The text translates to: “Demonstrators celebrations in #[Liberation Square, Baghdad] With the killing of the terrorist Qassem Soleimani. #نريد_وطن”

I contacted Allamy on Twitter and he claimed he took the video himself. He also said no one from the State Department contacted him to confirm the video’s authenticity. When I asked him why his location was Germany, he told me that “when you live in Iraq and you speak against the militias, then you know that your location on the media will kill you as it did before.”

He got angry after seeing I opposed the strikes and accused me of wanting to “blow” him up.

As a reminder, the famous video of Iraqis toppling a statue of Saddam Hussein after the US captured Baghdad was a completely staged psy-op.

The list, published on the Times’ website early Thursday morning, just hours before Suleimani was killed during a drone strike in Baghdad, also included Princess Leonor of Spain, Nigerian Afrobeat star David Adedeji (better known by his stage name Davido) and Italian politician Giorgia Meloni.

But the highlight (at least, in hindsight) will likely be Suleimani, who is included as the list’s final entry. In the description, Times’ writer Richard Spencer claims that 2020 could be the year that the long-serving general finally “cement[s] his reputation as the Machiavelli of the Middle East – or prove that even the smartest operators can suffer hubris”.

Moving on, Spencer writes that the Iranian general was already well-known to intelligence agencies as “the guiding force of Iran’s cross-border operations.”

Offering a massive dose of irony, the Times noted how Suleimani’s movements are “well-signalled” due to his status as a celebrity general, who “even poses for selfies” with militia leaders across the region.

Spencer noted that Suleiman had succeeded in making Iran’s long-held dream of a “land corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean” a reality (such a stretch is apparently controlled by Iran-backed militias, from Iraq, to Lebanon, and everywhere in between (Syria).

Finally, it was noted that Suleimani’s popularity had taken a dive in the months and years before his death, evidenced by the protests in Iraq and Lebanon over Iran’s growing influence.

The piece concluded by claiming that “if General Soleimani can hold the line, he will have shown he deserves the trust of Iran’s Supreme Leader.”

Since his death, the general has been cited by pundits as a potential successor to the Ayatollah.

This will be the year in which a slight, grey-haired general will cement his reputation as the Machiavelli of the Middle East — or prove that even the smartest operators can suffer hubris (Richard Spencer writes). A decade ago, Qassem Soleimani was already known to intelligence agencies as the guiding force of Iran’s cross-border operations. He was the link man to Hezbollah in Lebanon and it was he who masterminded the strategy whereby a “resistance” movement based on Shia militias bombed and shot British and American troops out of Iraq. Now his movements are well-signalled. As head of the al-Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Revolutionary Guard, he backs militia leaders across the Levant and Yemen, and even poses for selfies with them. Deftly reacting to the Syrian war, American uncertainty and the conflict against Isis, he has established Iran’s long-held dream of a land corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean, controlled by loyal militias. But he is experiencing resistance. Popular protests in Lebanon and Iraq may not have been hostile to Iran when they began but, seeing them as a threat, Major-General Soleimani has taken action. He has been to Baghdad at least twice, summoned militia leaders and pro-Iran politicians, and ordered them to stand firm. In Lebanon, where Iran’s ally Hezbollah has tried to market itself as a nationalist force, he has been more subtle. A recent opinion poll, though, suggested that Hezbollah had lost support rapidly from the Christian and Sunni communities, even as more of Iraq’s Shia population turn against Iran. If General Soleimani can hold the line, he will have shown he deserves the trust of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The general’s inclusion on the list is just another reason to doubt claims that the assassination was planned to distract from Trump’s upcoming trial or the release of unflattering government documents

President Trump ordered a U.S. military attack that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force, among other military officials at Baghdad International Airport early Friday, the Pentagon confirmed. Friday’s Baghdad strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, a source told Fox News.

When President Donald Trump gave the order to kill Iran’s Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani, he not only made an arguably proportionate response to the invasion of the U.S. Embassy this week but he also reversed a policy of the Obama administration.

According to a report from 2018, Israel was “on the verge” of assassinating Soleimani in 2015, but Obama’s officials foiled the plan. In fact, they reached out to Iran with news of Israel’s plans.

The Trump administration, on the other hand, gave Israel a green light to assassinate Soleimani, according to a January 1, 2018 report from the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.

The paper quoted a source in Jerusalem as saying that “there is an American-Israeli agreement” that Soleimani is a “threat to the two countries’ interests in the region.”

According to Haaretz, Al-Jarida is generally assumed to be a platform for the Israeli government to disseminate its message to other Middle Eastern governments.

"Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Thursday evening that President Donald Trump had even more legal authority to eliminate Qassem Soleimani than former President Barack Obama had to take out Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Dershowitz, speaking with host Joel Pollak and guest host John Hayward on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, dismissed arguments that Trump lacked constitutional authority to act against General Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force.

Presidents have lawful authority to direct the killing of enemy combatants, explained Dershowitz.

“[Soleimani] was a combatant,” explained Dershowitz. “There’s no doubt that he fit the description of ‘combatant.’ He [was] a uniformed member of an enemy military who was actively planning to kill Americans; American soldiers and probably, as well, American civilians.”

“It was the right thing to do,” he added. “It was legally justified, and I think we should applaud the president for his decision. We send a very powerful message to the Iranian government that we will not stand by as the American embassy is attacked — which is an act of war — and we will not stand by as plans are being made to attack and kill American soldiers.

"Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killing, said on Thursday night that the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian terrorist mastermind Gen. Qasem Soleimani was a violation of international law.

The U.N. has been oddly quiet about Soleimani’s violations of international law, including activities that indisputably violated U.N. sanctions.

“The targeted killings of Qasem Soleiman and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis are most likely unlawful and violate international human rights law: Outside the context of active hostilities, the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal,” Callamard wrote on Twitter.

She proceeded to lay out an impossibly stringent standard for preventive action that becomes grotesquely amusing when measured against Soleimani’s malign activities, not least his involvement in an undisputed act of war against the United States, the attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad last week:

To be justified under international human rights law, intentionally lethal or potentially lethal force can only be used where strictly necessary to protect against an imminent threat to life. In other words, whoever targeted these two men would need to demonstrate that the persons targeted constitute(d) an imminent threat to others. An individual’s past involvement in “terrorist” attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful.

"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) says he was briefed on the plan to target Iran’s No. 2 Qassem Soleimani earlier this week, and that he advised President Trump to cripple Iran’s economy by taking out the country’s oil refineries.

“I was briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida,” said Graham during a Friday interview on Fox & Friends, adding “If I were the president, I would put on the table targets in Iran, not Iraq and Syria. Economic targets that would crush the economy.”

Notably, Graham appears to be the only member of Congress briefed on the military action while he was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago for a round of golf.

Graham was asked “You say, the next stop is their oil fields, right?”

To which he responded: “Well, what I’m trying to do is create deterrents,” adding “What are they thinking about in Tehran right now? Revenge.”

“What are they thinking about inside Iraq? All of these Shiite militias are going to have three days of mourning.”

“What kind of command and control do they have regarding Tehran? Who makes the decisions to strike, and what kind of strikes are they contemplating? How would you stop retaliation to deterrents? What’s the one thing that the regime can’t afford to lose? The ability to refine oil . So what President Trump has done is up the ante as high as you can up it.

﻿

Rice said, “I am doubtful ultimately it will prove to be the right thing. In the first instance, any of us familiar with Qasem Soleimani and the extraordinary blood on his hands has to be happy to see him off the battlefield. He was a murderer and terrorist of the first order.”

She added, “Having said that, whether we and Americans around the world are safer as a result of his targeted assassination than they would have been had we pursued other means to deal with what was purportedly the imminent threat at hand.

"A convoy carrying high-profile members of the Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias, was hit by an airstrike while traveling in Baghdad, according to multiple reports.

The three-car convoy was struck in the northern outskirts of the Iraqi capital in the district of al-Taji, according to an Iraqi military source cited by Reuters. Six militiamen were reported killed in the attack, with three others critically injured. It remains unclear who carried out the strike.

The six killed in the strike have yet to be named, but early reports suggest two paramilitary commanders – Shibl al-Zaydi, secretary general of the Kataib al-Imam militia, as well as Qais Khazali, leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq – might be among the dead.

The bombing comes on the heels of a US air raid near the Baghdad International Airport, which killed Iran’s powerful Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and several top officials in the PMF. Washington argued the strike was “aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” while Tehran slammed the move as an act of “international terrorism” and threatened “crushing revenge.”

Though US President Donald Trump insisted the decision was taken “to stop a war,” stressing that he didn’t seek “regime change” in Tehran, that interpretation was clearly not shared by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who warned “revenge awaits the criminals who have stained their hands in [Soleimani’s] blood.”



In this high energy breakdown Alex Jones exposes the true motives of Trump’s surgical strike that took out Qassem Soleimani and what this means for the future of America and the Middle East.

Though US President Donald Trump insisted the decision was taken “to stop a war,” stressing that he didn’t seek “regime change” in Tehran, that interpretation was clearly not shared by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who warned “revenge awaits the criminals who have stained their hands in [Soleimani’s] blood.”



In this high energy breakdown Alex Jones exposes the true motives of Trump’s surgical strike that took out Qassem Soleimani and what this means for the future of America and the Middle East.

"Update (0900ET) : President Trump has expanded his comments this morning, switching focus to Soleimani’s terrible deeds…

“General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more… but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!“

Having tweeted a patriotic US flag last night following the actions to assassinate Soleimani…

President Trump’s first direct tweet (he has retweeted numerous comments from others) since the attack is a clear jab at the Democrats over their actions (or lack of them) on Iran’s death-dealers…

Biden – who trump is clearly taking aim at – said the following…

And Warren followed a similar line…

“Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.”

"Authorities in Australia are working on the premise that arsonists and lightning strikes are to blame for bushfires that have devastated numerous areas of the country, not “climate change” as many global warming alarmists have claimed.

Since November, the fires have struck various regions of the state of New South Wales, destroying thousands of buildings and killing at least 22 people.

Despite the fact that bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, the severity of the damage led numerous climate change alarmists to blame the disaster on man-made global warming.

Earlier this week, Bernie Sanders blamed those who were “delaying action on climate change” for “the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.”

However, according to those tasked with investigating the fires, climate change has nothing to do with it.

Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice. https://t.co/TWh1KQycs4 @ebatten7 #NSWFires #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/Dul8dMFrZv — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) January 3, 2020

“Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season,” reports 7 News Sydney.

Authorities in the country have formed Strike Force Indarra, comprising of detectives from homicide and arson units in an attempt to find the culprits.

Other causes for the fires include lightning strikes and a natural weather phenomenon called Dipole, again neither of which have anything to do with man-made climate change.

Many bushfires are also actually caused by environmentalist ‘green’ policies which prevent land owners from clearing their own vegetation to protect themselves.

“Governments appeasing the green beast have ignored numerous state and federal bushfire inquiries over the past decade, almost all of which have recommended increasing the practice of “prescribed burning,” writes Miranda Devine. “Also known as “hazard reduction”, it is a methodical regime of burning off flammable ground cover in cooler months, in a controlled fashion, so it does not fuel the inevitable summer bushfires.”

As ever with climate change alarmists, they don’t let the facts get in the way of a good power grab.

"In today’s political discourse, the minimum wage is frequently mentioned by the more progressive members of Congress.

On a basic level, raising the minimum wage appears to be a sympathetic policy for low-income wage earners. Often kept out of the conversation, however, are the downstream effects of this proposal.

The consensus among economists has always been that a price floor on “low-skilled labor” leads to unemployment “among the very people minimum wage legislation allegedly helps.” Surely those who retain their employment will reap the higher hourly pay but not without consequence to the rest of the “low-skilled” labor market.

Government-mandated minimum wage increases directly result in a higher price floor for hourly labor. The more indirect consequences include reductions in hours worked, layoffs, automation, operational changes, and loss of opportunity. In Economics 101, students are taught about trade-offs. A trade-off, as defined by the Business Dictionary, is “a technique of reducing or forgoing one or more desirable outcomes in exchange for increasing or obtaining other desirable outcomes in order to maximize the total return.” We incur trade-offs every day, such as the decision to buy dinner from a restaurant for $10 or to eat our holiday leftovers. Businesses incur trade-offs as well.

For example, let’s consider your local grocery store. The grocer may employ ten people, including one manager and nine employees. The manager makes well over the current minimum wage, but six of the nine other employees make the current minimum wage. If the current minimum wage is increased from $7.25 to $12.50 per hour, the rate of increase is 72.4 percent. While this increase may sound reasonable from the perspective of some readers, this is a large increase given the relatively low profit margins in this industry. What are the downstream effects?

The employer may either reduce the hours worked for employees or lay off staff. Several things result:

Those who are not laid off will reap the benefits of a higher minimum wage, but they will have to work harder to make up for less staff.

Staff making a wage higher than the old minimum wage but lower than the new rate will also request that their wages be increased to distinguish them from their peers (those who retained their jobs at the higher minimum wage) and to compensate them for their skills.

Those who are laid off will be forced to find other employment.

There may be a lack of employment due to these employees being priced out of the market.

The Effects on Youth Employment

Meanwhile, rapid advancements in technology may result in fewer job opportunities when the cost of labor is higher. Think of your local Kroger’s self-checkout line or Chick-fil-A’s mobile-ordering application.

Not surprisingly, American Action Forum’s evidence indicates that minority youth may be the most negatively affected by wage price floors. Various studies have analyzed the impact of minimum wage increases, most of which have been gradual increases implemented over a period of years. In an EconTalk podcast with Russ Roberts, Jacob Vigdor shared his main findings about Seattle’s minimum wage increase: “First of all, the minimum wage did appear to raise wages. … That’s what we expected to see. But when we looked at employment, we actually saw a reduction.” Vigdor further mentions that hours worked decreased as wages went up.

RED ALERT! Deep State Plan To Trigger Civil War In Virginia Discovered



Tom Pappert joins The Alex Jones Show to break down the Deep State plan to trigger a civil war in Virginia, and bring in U.N. troops.

The study showed that the amount of money paid in the low-wage labor market declined overall, or in the aggregate. The results varied depending on the level of experience of the worker; those with the most work experience came out ahead. Vigdor’s study shows that on average their paychecks were twenty dollars higher per week. But the biggest loss “in terms of much lower pay would be amongst the workers who hadn’t even entered the labor market yet when the minimum wage started to increase, because they were finding it harder to find any work at all.”

The key takeaway from Vigdor’s study was the minimum wage’s effect on workers who had yet to enter the labor market. In effect, the higher minimum wage created a barrier to entering the hourly labor market for those without experience. Who tends to lack experience? Young individuals and immigrants.

As any young individual seeking an internship or their first job knows, the hardest thing about the search is having sufficient experience. Experience means that the individual needs less training and can be productive on the first day. Businesses understand that “on-the-job training is an investment, and at $15 an hour that investment doesn’t make sense from the business owner’s perspective.” This investment makes even less sense when it is understood that the teenager will only work for a few months and then leave, a dilemma that many employers face during summer and winter breaks.

The Employment Policies Institute addresses teen unemployment in an article titled “The Teen Unemployment Crisis: Questions and Answers.” It notes that one of the goals of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is to “protect the educational opportunities of minors.” Problematically, increasing the cost of labor disincentivizes companies from hiring workers, especially those who require training. Additionally, as technology rapidly advances, easily automated functions may become obsolete for workers. Policymakers must consider the interests of ensuring a viable labor market for our nation’s youth while promoting policies that incentivize businesses to pay decent wages.

Although many teenagers may be predisposed to sympathize with progressive policies like minimum wage increases, they ought to understand the larger implications of such proposals. Markets can withstand gradual change, but they may be unable to adequately adjust to steep increases in the cost of labor. In New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, US Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis famously described how a “state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country”; Justice Brandeis coined the phrase “ laboratories of democracy .” Twnety-nine states and the District of Columbia, as of 2019, have experimented with minimum wage increases. But studies have demonstrated that these progressive “successes” do not come without unintended consequences.

"In today’s political discourse, the minimum wage is frequently mentioned by the more progressive members of Congress.

On a basic level, raising the minimum wage appears to be a sympathetic policy for low-income wage earners. Often kept out of the conversation, however, are the downstream effects of this proposal.

The consensus among economists has always been that a price floor on “low-skilled labor” leads to unemployment “among the very people minimum wage legislation allegedly helps.” Surely those who retain their employment will reap the higher hourly pay but not without consequence to the rest of the “low-skilled” labor market.

Government-mandated minimum wage increases directly result in a higher price floor for hourly labor. The more indirect consequences include reductions in hours worked, layoffs, automation, operational changes, and loss of opportunity. In Economics 101, students are taught about trade-offs. A trade-off, as defined by the Business Dictionary, is “a technique of reducing or forgoing one or more desirable outcomes in exchange for increasing or obtaining other desirable outcomes in order to maximize the total return.” We incur trade-offs every day, such as the decision to buy dinner from a restaurant for $10 or to eat our holiday leftovers. Businesses incur trade-offs as well.

For example, let’s consider your local grocery store. The grocer may employ ten people, including one manager and nine employees. The manager makes well over the current minimum wage, but six of the nine other employees make the current minimum wage. If the current minimum wage is increased from $7.25 to $12.50 per hour, the rate of increase is 72.4 percent. While this increase may sound reasonable from the perspective of some readers, this is a large increase given the relatively low profit margins in this industry. What are the downstream effects?

The employer may either reduce the hours worked for employees or lay off staff. Several things result:

Those who are not laid off will reap the benefits of a higher minimum wage, but they will have to work harder to make up for less staff.

Staff making a wage higher than the old minimum wage but lower than the new rate will also request that their wages be increased to distinguish them from their peers (those who retained their jobs at the higher minimum wage) and to compensate them for their skills.

Those who are laid off will be forced to find other employment.

There may be a lack of employment due to these employees being priced out of the market.

The Effects on Youth Employment

Meanwhile, rapid advancements in technology may result in fewer job opportunities when the cost of labor is higher. Think of your local Kroger’s self-checkout line or Chick-fil-A’s mobile-ordering application.

Not surprisingly, American Action Forum’s evidence indicates that minority youth may be the most negatively affected by wage price floors. Various studies have analyzed the impact of minimum wage increases, most of which have been gradual increases implemented over a period of years. In an EconTalk podcast with Russ Roberts, Jacob Vigdor shared his main findings about Seattle’s minimum wage increase: “First of all, the minimum wage did appear to raise wages. … That’s what we expected to see. But when we looked at employment, we actually saw a reduction.” Vigdor further mentions that hours worked decreased as wages went up.

RED ALERT! Deep State Plan To Trigger Civil War In Virginia Discovered



Tom Pappert joins The Alex Jones Show to break down the Deep State plan to trigger a civil war in Virginia, and bring in U.N. troops.

The study showed that the amount of money paid in the low-wage labor market declined overall, or in the aggregate. The results varied depending on the level of experience of the worker; those with the most work experience came out ahead. Vigdor’s study shows that on average their paychecks were twenty dollars higher per week. But the biggest loss “in terms of much lower pay would be amongst the workers who hadn’t even entered the labor market yet when the minimum wage started to increase, because they were finding it harder to find any work at all.”

The key takeaway from Vigdor’s study was the minimum wage’s effect on workers who had yet to enter the labor market. In effect, the higher minimum wage created a barrier to entering the hourly labor market for those without experience. Who tends to lack experience? Young individuals and immigrants.

As any young individual seeking an internship or their first job knows, the hardest thing about the search is having sufficient experience.

"Tesla’s Shanghai factory has only been up and producing vehicles for a couple of months. Despite this, Tesla is already putting price cuts into effect for the Model 3s that it is producing there.

On Thursday, the company cut the price of the Model 3 by a whopping 16%, from 355,800 yuan to 299,050 ($42,919), according to CNBC. The reduction is partly due to receiving Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles. The subsidies amounted to about half the cut, totaling 24,750 yuan.

The price cuts are also part of a larger group of changes Tesla has made to its sales policy in China, including changing prices for car accessories and home charging facilities. Tesla has said that it plans on delivering cars made at the $2 billion Shanghai plant on January 7.

This follows 15 employees who took delivery of their vehicles earlier this week after purchasing them back in October.

Tesla has said that 30% of its China supply chain was localized, which means that some parts are still shipped in to help build vehicles. The company is aiming to localize all of its China supply chain by the end of 2020.

Shanghai’s goal is to produce 1,000 unit per week, or about 280 cars per day.

"Free marketeers have rightly written many refutations of the minimum wage.

However, it’s difficult to beat something with nothing, and so this article will outline major ways in which wages actually rise: through capital accumulation and the honing of skills that others value.

What Determines Wages?

Before looking at how wages can increase, what determines them in the first place? Wages tend to equal the productivity of the worker. If Jones the chef can bring in thirty dollars an hour for Smith, the restaurant owner, Smith will have to pay Jones almost thirty dollars an hour, or else another restaurant can snag Jones away along with the revenue he offers.

This competition between employers over workers is the reason why 97.9 percent of hourly workers in the US make more than the federal minimum wage. The federal government doesn’t mandate these high wages, but the market does.

Many states have their own minimum wages set higher than the federal minimum wage, and yet many hourly employees in every state are paid higher than they are legally required to be, not because employers are generous, but because of worker productivity and competition over scarce labor.

One: Society Accumulates Capital Goods

The first way a worker’s wage can grow requires nothing of the worker at all. Holding a given worker’s situation constant, when the rest of society is able to produce more goods and services, prices will fall, and the real value of wages will increase.

If factories and workshops become more productive, even if this excludes a given worker’s place of occupation, then when he goes to the supermarket, his paycheck will go farther. There are more goods to go around, and prices have fallen.

This raises the question, how does society become more productive? The two-step process is saving and investing in capital goods (the machines and tools that produce other goods). Rather than spending all earnings on ice cream and videogames, people save their money to maintain existing capital and invest in new tractors, machine tools, assembly lines, etc. Less present consumption is traded in for more future consumption.

Two: The Industry Upgrades Its Complementary Capital

A second way a worker’s wage can increase also requires nothing of the worker. His wage will rise if his industry upgrades the capital goods he uses and thereby makes him more productive.

Textile workers who sew by hand get sewing machines, farm workers with scythes get combine harvesters, construction workers with shovels get bulldozers, etc. When this new capital allows workers to produce more for their employers (and society) than they could before, their value to their employers increases, and their wages increase.

In technical terms, new capital that is complementary to labor increases the productivity of, the demand for, and the price of labor.

This is the flip side of unemployment by automation. Sometimes capital is a substitute for labor, but it’s often a complement. This is largely why workers in relatively capital-poor countries can earn multiples more when they move to countries rich with capital complementary to their labor, even holding their skills constant.

Three: The Worker Accumulates Human Capital

The third route to higher wages comes from the worker himself and is the most obvious. If wages tend to equal productivity, workers can increase their wages by improving their skills to offer more to their employers’ bottom lines, which also means contributing more to society’s material provision.

Alternatively, they could learn altogether new skills that are in higher demand and lower supply to secure new, higher-paying jobs.

Removing State Barriers

Ultimately, only sacrificing present consumption and investing in capital (physical or human) to increase productivity can move society forward against scarcity. Increasing productivity takes time, but the state has imposed many obstacles to productivity that would raise wages rapidly if removed.

It goes without saying that eliminating or reducing the income and payroll taxes would increase worker pay, but there are less obvious wage-reducing taxes.

A sales tax is similar to destroying a portion of everything a worker makes, because the state takes a fraction of the item’s sale receipts. In this way, the sales tax is a reduction of the worker’s productivity, and consequently the wage the worker can command. After his paycheck is reduced, the worker pays the sales tax again, when everything he wants to buy is more expensive.

A wealth tax, such as the one Elizabeth Warren is proposing, penalizes the ownership of capital goods, which drive the first two mechanisms for raising wages outlined above. The list of taxes goes on, and then there are the regulations, which won’t be elaborated here. The accumulation of physical and human capital means more goods and services to go around for everyone, and a bigger paycheck for the worker.

"In 1972, Stone Age Economics, by anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, appeared.

It came out in France in 1976 under the title Stone Age, Age of Plenty. The aim of the author is to deconstruct what he considers to be conventional wisdom about the disadvantages of primitive societies and the advantages of industrial civilization. He threw stones in a still pond by showing that the hunter-gatherers had a life full of abundance and less painful than the settled peoples did.

We learn indeed that they worked only a few hours a day and were better nourished than the human beings who succeeded the Neolithic Revolution, agriculture, and the rise of more sedentary lives. The work had a resounding effect. According to left-wing anarchist and anthropologist David Graeber, Sahlins’s work had a decisive influence on the emergence of ecological, decreasing, and primitivist movements in the 1970s.1 The conclusion of this story is a priori confusing and poses a real question: why the heck have human beings settled down, since this has led them to work more to earn less? Are humans as rational as they claim?

Hunter-Gatherers and Malthusianism

However, the suspicions of irrationality seem to dissipate if we include in our equation the question of the sustainability of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Economists Douglass North and Robert Paul Thomas describe the problem well when they point out that hunter-gatherers acted like parasites.1 They staged a vast tragedy of the commons.

They add no richness to what nature spontaneously offers. They have every incentive to overexploit it in the absence of well-defined property rights. Finally, they are subject to diminishing returns and heavy demographic constraints. Wherever they go, their resources are dead. More and more scientists believe that the hunting activities of prehistoric man are at least partially responsible for the extinction of the megafauna of the Pleistocene.2

It is now believed that it is this fragile sustainability that led the hunter-gatherer populations to resort to drastic Malthusian practices to limit their demography: prolonged breastfeeding by women, consumption of contraceptives and abortifacients, abstinence, wars, and, above all, routine infanticides. Some studies suggest that “intra- and intergroup killings routinely wiped out more than 5% of the population per generation.”3 Anthropologist Joseph Birdsell estimates that the rate of infanticide during the Pleistocene was between 15 and 50 percent of the total number of births and women seem to have been more targeted by this kind of abuse.45

The intellectuals who most idealize the hunter-gatherer lifestyle do not deny the frequent use of infanticides. Anthropologists like James C. Scott or Marshall Sahlins, however, attribute this behavior to the logistical constraints of nomadism, incompatible with the presence of too many young children.6 But these assertions, which slightly twist the neck with the dominant literature, join in finding the problem of durability. Because it is the depletion of resources that forces hunter-gatherers to migrate continuously.

The Invention of Agricultural Capitalism: An Ecological Response to the Excesses of Hunter-Gatherers?

The emancipatory fraternity of the first primitive communities and their harmony with nature thus prove to be a fable. The relative idleness which characterizes the primitive and free way of life was obtained only at the price of actions intended to compensate for an unsustainable management of the substances available in the wild. It was not until the Neolithic era that this problem was circumvented by the institution of agriculture.

Agriculture inaugurates several major upheavals. It introduced the first forms of land, plant, and animal property for the purposes of domestication, conservation, and sustainable production. Man ceases to be a mere consumer. He becomes a producer.

It is therefore logical that it [humanity] also ceases to perceive itself as a parasite and that it allows itself to form more densely populated communities. The density of hunter-gatherer communities was generally around 0.1 people per square mile (2,590 square kilometers), with the exception of the more resource-intensive areas. It is estimated that the first forms of agriculture allowed this density to be multiplied by at least forty.7

Agriculture humanizes family relationships. It reduces the need to resort to infanticide. In the words of libertarian anthropologist James C. Scott, “Sedentary farmers were experiencing unprecedented reproductive rates.”8

Private Property, Mother of Ecology

The property rights that emerged with the agricultural revolution were therefore born from the demographic constraints that inevitably arose from the environmental excesses inherent in the way of life of primitive societies. What lessons can we learn from this story?

The fable of the good savage remains a myth. Civilization based on the principle of private property is not the enemy of sustainable development. On the contrary, it is societies that despise or ignore private property that expose themselves to Malthusian tragedies and abuses.

Private property is, finally, a force of responsibility and conservation. All of the endangered species are now wild species while domesticated animals, especially for food, have never been so numerous. The challenge of resource conservation is therefore to introduce domestication — and private property — wherever possible.

"Belgium has the European Union's lowest employment rate for non-EU immigrants, according to a new report.

A mere 52 percent of non-EU migrants between the ages of 20 and 64-years-old are employed in Belgium, leaving the country trailing France (55%), the Netherlands (60%), and Germany (64%), according to statistics analyzed by Tom Lallemand of SCEPTR.

Interestingly, migrants from predominantly Islamic countries tip the unemployment scales most heavily.

“We must dare to face the facts,"" says sociologist Mark Elchardus. “We see the figures in the study I am currently working on.""

""Of the non-Muslims, 84 percent of 25 to 35-year-olds have a job. For Muslims, it is 43 percent,” he explained, contrasting native Dutch citizens with Islamic immigrants.

The number of official 'job seekers' raking in unemployment benefits is highest in the cities.

In Antwerp, nearly 75 percent of 'workers' drawing unemployment benefits have a migration background, while that number is closer to 50 percent in Ghent.

Unemployment among women whose families hail from North Africa, Turkey, and the Middle East is also astonishingly high.

“Remarkably few women of foreign origin have a job in Flanders — only 34 percent, according to figures from the Local Integration and Integration Monitor,” Lallemand notes.

“The employment rate is particularly lower for women from the Maghreb, Turkey, the Near East and the Middle East. Many women from those areas have no job and are not looking for it.”

"A recent analysis by the UK’s The Daily Telegraph has found that tens of thousands of thieves in Britain were escaping justice due to police officers’ need to prioritize “more serious” crimes.

UK security firm, My Local Bobby, is launching Britain’s first private prosecutions for theft, shoplifting and other “minor” crimes amid frustration with Metropolitan Police Service’s refusals to investigate and charge offenders when called to the crime scene, The Daily Telegraph reported.

The private firm was launched a few years ago by former Met Detective Chief Inspector David McKelvey and ex-Met Commander Tony Nash, as part of their company TM Eye.

Alex Jones lays out the motifs between mass shootings in the United States (shooters on pharmaceutical drugs, ignored FBI and police reports, 24/7 mainstream media coverage, etc.) and analyzes the most recent church shooting in White Settlement, Texas.

My Local Bobby, funded by local businesses and residents, is currently patrolling the streets of central and north London, but McKelvey complained to the outlet that in the past year London police had often failed to prosecute pickpockets or drug dealers apprehended by private officers, often releasing them due to limited space in custody areas or insufficient human resources.

“Now police take ages to turn up and when they do turn up, despite overwhelming evidence, they will simply take the handcuffs off and release them. We have looked at ways to do it, trying to liaise with police and senior managers in the police,” McKelvey told The Telegraph, when discussing the initiate.

“But what we have done now is to employ a new prosecution team on shoplifting, pickpockets, low level assaults and drug dealing and we will prosecute these offences ourselves,” My Local Bobby’s founder explained.

The former inspector claimed that the introduction of private prosecutions could be a “win-win” situation for the UK police, potentially helping them to allocate “resources to crimes that require more police time” and only benefit local residents in the end.

“Anyone can arrest and prosecute someone. What you have to do is to meet the public interest threshold and have sufficient evidence to bring a case,” McKelvey concluded.

It is so far unclear how London’s Met Police will react to the initiative as My Local Bobby has just mounted its first test case, involving a shoplifter who was not charged by the police.

According to a former Met Detective, officers’ failure to prosecute offenders was often explained by insufficient amount of space and time for their interviews in custody suites.

There were around 316,000 thefts registered in London from January 2019 until October 2019, according to the Met Police website - a rise of more than 40,000 crimes in comparison to the same period last year.

This related to pickpocketing, shoplifting, and stealing from personal motor vehicles.

Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has admitted recently that national detection rates were “woefully low,” with only 8.2% of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales in 2018 resulting in charges.

A recent analysis of police data by The Daily Telegraph revealed that in some parts of Great Britain as few as one in 500 personal thefts such as pickpocketing were solved by police.

"German state broadcaster WDR2 faced protests after it broadcast a video in which a group of children were taught to sing about how their grandmas were “environmental pigs” for driving non-electric vehicles and eating meat.

The controversy began after WDR2 aired the clip in which the kids sing, “My grandma drives in the chicken coop with her motorcycle…that’s thousands of gallons of gas every month, my grandma is an old environmental pig!”

In another part of the song the children sing, “Every day my grandma fries herself a pork chop…she does it because discount meat costs nearly nothing, my grandma is an old environmental pig!”

An almost immediate backlash prompted WDR2 to delete the online version of the clip before angry grandmas descended on WDR’s offices in Cologne to protest against the broadcaster.

“We are grandmas. Not #Nazi Pigs!” read one of the signs at the rally while another said, “My grandma is an old environmental pig. WDR exploits children to slander the elderly. Shameful! Stop causing division.”

If one of my children were to allow one of their children to sing something like this, which would never be the case, the shit would really hit the fan,” said one of the protesters. Without us grandmas, this country would have crapped out a long time ago.”

Commentators warned that the backlash was being exploited by “right-wing extremists,” prompting an Antifa presence at the grandma protest and the sight of left-wing radicals literally getting angry at grandmas for expressing their free speech.

The whole controversy was later dubbed ‘Grandmagate’ and although it is legitimately creepy that kids are being indoctrinated via climate change hysteria to hate their own family members, some think there’s bigger fish to fry in Germany.

“Well. The invasion of hundreds of thousands of third-world migrants is not enough to get ordinary German citizens to take to the streets. Not even if those culture-enrichers engage in rape, assault, robbery, arson, and other forms of general mayhem. But insulting their grandmas — that’s going too far!” commented the Gates of Vienna blog.

"The number of migrants crossing the English Channel spiked by more than 600 percent in 2019, with Brexit being cited as a primary driver behind the massive increase.

The arrival of three more boats on New Year's Eve brought the total of migrants who had successfully reached English soil to at least 1,892, according to figures compiled by the BBC.

Additionally, at least 1,235 illegal migrants were apprehended by French authorities while attempting the crossing during the year.

“An estimated 1,800 migrants made the perilous sea crossing over the English Channel in 2019 – more than six times the figure in the previous year, when the issue was declared a ‘major incident’ by the then home secretary Sajid Javid,” the Independent reports.

In December, 2018, Javid issued a 'major incident' declaration after 138 migrants arrived via boat. More than twice that number (283) arrived in December of 2019.

""One of the drivers, we’re being told, is that people smugglers and traffickers are telling these folk that after Brexit Britain will close in some way,"" Lucy Moreton, general secretary for the Immigration Service Union, told the BBC.

""In practice, of course, this is illegal anyway, and it will be as illegal on 31 January as it is on 1 February. Brexit doesn’t make a difference, but we do know that the criminals are using this to try to drive more business.""

Moreton asserted the Channel has become ""very much a business-as-usual route,"" admitting ""this is something that we just expect.""

“The numbers have increased massively in the last couple of weeks. We do normally see an increase in clandestine migration over Christmas – that’s been a pattern for decades. But this is the first time that we’ve seen this quite so dramatically in small boats.”

Out of more than 1,800 migrants who crossed the English Channel, fewer than 130 have reportedly been sent back to mainland Europe.

"Leipzig police have launched an attempted murder investigation after a policeman was severely injured on New Year's Eve.

Activists in the Connewitz district reportedly targeted officers with missiles and fireworks.

Seven men and two women were arrested on Wednesday afternoon, police said, as investigators launched a probe into possible attempted murder of a police officer.

Alex Jones lays out the motifs between mass shootings in the United States (shooters on pharmaceutical drugs, ignored FBI and police reports, 24/7 mainstream media coverage, etc.) and analyzes the most recent church shooting in White Settlement, Texas.

Police said a ""group of violent criminals"" had attacked them in Leipzig's alternative Connewitz district in the early hours of the morning.

Officers reported that the group, said to be leftist activists, had pelted them with stones, thrown bottles and launched fireworks at officers.

One 38-year-old policeman was said to have been so badly hurt by a firework that he lost consciousness and had to undergo surgery.

Police said they had handed the case to a special commission which investigates far-left extremism.

The nine arrested individuals were accused of causing grievous bodily harm, resisting police and serious breaches of the peace. Three other detainees were released.

Political condemnation

The state of Saxony's Interior Minister Roland Wöller said there had been ""a conscious and targeted attack on human life.""

Leipzig's Mayor Burkhard Jung described the events as a ""violent outbreak of criminal violence,"" which he condemned ""from the bottom of his heart.""

Some thousand people had gathered in Connewitz on Tuesday evening to see in the New Year. Shortly after midnight, the mood turned violent and police were attacked.

The district is a stronghold of the left-wing alternative scene, and has a history of violence between activists and police.
